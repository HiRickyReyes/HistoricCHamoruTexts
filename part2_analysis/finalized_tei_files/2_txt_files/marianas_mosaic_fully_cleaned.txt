Introduction (Ajani Burrell)

project supported in great measure by a generous grant from the Northern Marianas
Humanities Council, along with matching funds from the Northern Marianas
College (NMC). The book is a collection of essays, articles, and narratives that ex-
plores some of the many topics relevant to contemporary life in the Marianas.

As we embarked on this project, we had two primary goals. One was to meaningfully
contribute to the intellectual and cultural mosaic of the Marianas. The other was
to do so in a comprehensive fashion. To accomplish the former, we reviewed the
existing literature on the region to establish what gaps we might help to fill. While
substantial literature on the Marianas exists, and seems to increase in volume every
year, much of this literature does not utilize an academic or scholarly approach.
Consequently, while this collection is not exclusively a scholarly endeavor, a signif-
icant number of the contributions are scholarly in form and approach. Moreover,
existing literature that does examine aspects of contemporary life in the Marianas

often suffers from a lack of accessibility, whether sequestered behind publisher pay-
walls or accessible only in physical archives. In compiling these works, we sought to
make a broad collection of writings on the Marianas available—in one accessible
place— to the people of the Marianas and beyond.

Any investigation of human life for a locale or set of peoples is invariably under-
pinned by an investigation of culture. Exploration of the existing literature on culture
and related subjects in the Marianas was instructive in helping us ascertain what
space this book might occupy. In addition to the usual internet databases, directo-
ries, indexes, and search engines, two valuable resources were the Pacific Collection
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Archives, both
housed at the Northern Marianas College. These resources offered a wealth of local
literature, much of which are primary sources or texts unavailable in digital format.

Also invaluable were the digital catalogs of the Micronesian Area Research Center
(MARC), housed at the University of Guam (UOG), and the peer-reviewed journal
Pacific Asia Inquiry, a UOG publication. The former provided information on or access
to locally produced or locally relevant scholarship, such as unpublished theses, that
were often difficult to find via other digital platforms. The latter helped us better
appreciate the scope of Micronesia-specific cultural scholarship produced in the
past decade. These resources, among others, confirmed to us that while there was
considerable literature about the Marianas, and considerable academic scholarship
on the region, there was not nearly enough scholarly literature examining local life
and culture to reflect the diversity and vitality teeming in the islands today. Notable
examples of existing scholarship include such works as The New Shape of Old Island
Cultures: A Half Century of Social Change in Micronesia and Making Sense of Micronesia:
The Logic of Pacific Island Culture, both by Francis X. Hezel (2001 & 2013); Tiempon I
Manmofo’na: Ancient Chamorro Culture and History of the Northern Mariana Islands by
Scott C. Russell (1998); Cultures of Commemoration: The Politics of War, Memory and
History in the Mariana Islands by Keith L. Camacho (2011); and Saipan: The Ethnology
of a War-Devastated Island by Alexander Spoehr (1954).

This selection of books, as well as many other similar titles, highlights two key gaps
in the scholarly literature on life and culture in the Marianas. One shortcoming is
that much of what literature does exist often subsumes the Marianas in the broader
regional scope of Micronesia, and in some cases the wider Pacific (e.g., Liston et al.
[2011]; Pacific Island Heritage: Archeology, Identity & Community; Farzana Gounder’s
[2015] Narrative and Identity Construction in the Pacific Islands; or Strathern et al.’s
[2002] Oceania: An Introduction to the Cultures and Identities of Pacific Islanders). To be
sure, a great many commonalities exists amongst the people of the various islands
of Micronesia, and to a lesser extent the wider Pacific Islands or Oceania region,
yet these commonalities are likely dwarfed by the unique dynamics at play in
each of the constituent entities. For example, in a move that only took full effect
in 1986, the CNMI freely entered into a political union with the United States as
a commonwealth, a circumstance that distinguishes it from fellow territories and
other nations in the Pacific (as well as US territories elsewhere). Guam, meanwhile,
serves as the home for some of the largest US military installations in the Pacific,
and allows non-indigenous ownership of land, both circumstances that distinguish
it from many Oceanic nations. The dynamics in these examples have been at play
for decades, yet continue to exert a profound impact on the people and life in the
respective islands today.

Another issue highlighted in those texts is the historical focus of much of the schol-
arship produced about the region. Humans, according to current research, have
inhabited the Marianas for over 3,500 years. The islands have also been impacted
by Western colonialism for much of the past 400 years, and played a vital role in the
Pacific theater of World War II. As a consequence, the region has been of great in-
terest to historians and archeologists from around the world. And yet, even though
the Marianas has now collectively spent several decades under the auspices of the
United States, recent scholarship on the region continues to reflect an imbalance
between the historical and the contemporary. As such, the bulk of the existing
Marianas-related scholarship examines aspects of life that far predate the present.

Despite its relatively small land mass and population, the Mariana Islands can
claim several compelling reasons (beyond their intriguing history) to document life
today. As previously mentioned, the islands have a unique territorial relationship
to the United States, a relationship all the more unique given the remote location
of the archipelago. This remote location is also of particular strategic importance
as the United States continues to engage the burgeoning regional power of China.
Because of its current relationship with the United States, as well as the globalizing

effects of such developments as the internet and cheap international travel, indig-
enous Marianas cultures—already themselves greatly altered by hundreds of years
of colonialism—are undergoing significant and rapid shifts. Moreover, given the
geopolitical dynamics of the past century in the region, the Marianas has one of the
most ethnically and culturally diverse populaces on the planet, a feat all the more
notable when considered in the context of the relatively small size of the islands and
a total population of less than 250,000 people across the archipelago. For these and
other reasons, we found it imperative to try to capture in some measure a scholarly
picture of present-day dynamics in the region.

To be fair, the literature on the region goes far beyond the aforementioned texts, and
far beyond scholarly or academic books in general. To a degree, the wider collection
of literature on life in the Marianas also suffers similar issues of scope (frequently
historical), but given the diversity it also provides more examples of contemporary
dynamics in the region. As we developed this project, we relied on and were inspired
by the work of such academics and writers as Laura Souder, Samuel F. McPhetres,
Vicente M. Diaz, Robert A. Underwood, Don Farrell, David Atienza de Frutos,
Michael L. Bevacqua, Mavis Warner Van Peenen, Bo Flood, and many others (some
of whose work appears in this volume) to guide us. This body of literature is com-
prised of both scholarly and creative work, but together it helps to highlight another
gap in the scholarly literature this volume aims to address: accessibility.

Over the lifespan of this project, we were pleased to see, year after year, ever more
contemporary scholarship produced on aspects of life in the Marianas. Much of this
scholarship was produced locally, or by sons and daughters of the Marianas who
live, work, and study elsewhere in the world. A significant portion of this scholarship
comes in the form of academic work done in pursuit of master’s and doctoral degrees,
in particular the theses that are a requirement for completion. These theses, while
valuable contributions to the scholarship, often go unpublished. Sometimes copies
will be procured by local institutions (such as the UOG’s MARC or the CNMI Pacific
Collection at NMC) or made available online, but apart from those avenues, access-
ing that literature is difficult, all the more so for non-researchers or non-academics.

Other limits on accessibility exist as well. Much of the scholarship on the region,
even relatively recent scholarship, is unavailable in digital format. Often it can only
be found in print versions, usually in the library collections of UOG or NMC. The
same goes for much primary source material of a cultural nature. Typically, it has
not been digitized, and frequently it is only accessible in person at one or two in-
stitutions in the region. Likewise, more recent scholarship that has been published
digitally often can only be found behind paywalls. All of these circumstances con-
firm two prevailing issues regarding cultural scholarship on the region. First, the
scholarship is often difficult to access for academics (and often next to impossible
for non-academics), and second, and perhaps more importantly, the academic liter-
ature on the region, while expansive and burgeoning, is often disparate and diffuse
in nature. It is these limitations, as well as the aforementioned gaps in the contem-
porary cultural scholarship on the region, that this book hopes to help redress.

To say that this book is merely a scholarly or academic one, however, would be in-
accurate. While we place an emphasis on the academic and see one of the primary
purposes of this endeavor to help fill certain gaps in the scholarship on the region,
the text is rounded out with more creative works. These creative works include
narratives and poetry, which further help to illuminate life in the Marianas today.
The inclusion of these creative works is a means to help us accomplish the other
principal objective of this text.

The other primary goal for this text was to provide a measure of comprehensiveness
as it addressed the subject of life in the Marianas today. One aspect of this goal was
to seek a broad scope of topics and issues within the relatively narrow geographic
focus. Our hope was to reflect the diverse nature of life through the varied pieces
in the book. Given life’s complexities, this is necessarily an endless pursuit, but
we sought to at least attempt it through an approach that advanced a panoramic
perspective comprised of multiple, micro-focused investigations. Among the more
than 20 contributions to this volume, none explore the same topic. Connections and
thematic threads exist, but each piece explores in its own unique way a particular
facet of life in the Marianas today. In this way we hoped to offer an expansive—if still
incomplete—picture of life in the region.

Another aspect of the comprehensive approach is an effort to reflect and pay homage
to the diversity and collective spirit of the region. Fundamentally, this meant ensur-
ing that voices from the different populous islands of the chain be heard. Given the

diversity present in the region, we also thought it imperative to gather voices of or
from as many groups and communities as possible. Thus, the book contains works
from academics, writers, educators, and other professionals. The contributors hail
from communities and embody characteristics too disparate to enumerate here,
though a notable feature is that women have authored a majority of the works in-
cluded. As we mentioned earlier, in addition to diverse subject matter, each author
approaches her topic in her own way and with her own voice. Some use a narrative
style, others a scholarly one. Others still take a blended approach, or one that seems
to use an observational or commentary style. And yet, despite differences in form
and subject matter, each work enlightens us to life in the Marianas as it is today—a
panorama via the micro-focused. In this way, this volume seeks to piece together
disparate elements into a contemporary mosaic of the Marianas.

While diversity is a notable feature of the region, and consequently an intellectually
honest examination of the region should acknowledge and document that charac-
teristic, such an approach nevertheless has its perils. Though the region has been
impacted—often brutally and adversely—by 400 years of colonialism, militarism,
and other hegemonic attitudes and policies, it must be recognized that indigenous
populations have persevered in the face of these conditions. Those populations
persevere to this day. The chief peril, then, in taking an approach that highlights
the diversity of the region, is to abet, as Kenneth Gofigan Kuper argues elsewhere
in this volume, the marginalization of indigenous voices under the guise of mul-
ticulturalism. To allow this would be a mistake. To combat it, this book seeks a
balance between indigenous and non-indigenous voices that befits the cultural
landscape of the region.

In addition to the goal of contributing to the literature of and on the region, and
doing so in a comprehensive way, we had one final guiding principle in the develop-
ment of this book, one that pertained to the audience. Our hope as editors was that
we might not simply create literature about the Marianas but also for the Marianas.
In particular, we hoped that this book would be available to anyone who wished to
read about life in the Marianas today. As such, care was taken to render the writing
in an accessible fashion, so that this book—composed of diverse content written by
diverse authors—could be read and appreciated by a diverse audience beyond the
traditional scope of academe.

As we examined the contributions to be included in this volume, several themes
emerged. Many of the pieces spoke to matters of place. Others dealt with matters
of person. Others still explored politics. Some addressed a combination of topics.
Beyond these themes of person, place, and politics, we found others to be more
salient as a guide to arranging this text. The works in this book fall into two gener-
al thematic categories: those that document or otherwise examine what we’ll call
“signs” of life or cultural dynamics in the region, and those that identify or other-
wise analyze the “shifts” underway in the region. The former category helps detail
the social, political, and cultural world the people of the Marianas inhabit today.
The latter seeks to clarify how we have arrived at this particular world with this par-
ticular set of dynamics, some of the effects of these dynamics and the longer-term
historical factors, such as colonialism, that shaped them, and how that world con-
tinues to change. Indigenous and non-indigenous voices help to establish both the
“signs” and “shifts” chronicled here. In some cases, particularly the pieces of a more
narrative bent, the signs or shifts manifest on a more personal note. In others, the
signs or shifts help us appreciate the dynamics taking place at a broader level.

We should say that the demarcation between “signs” and “shifts” is neither exact nor
absolute. Each piece is complex, delving into context, circumstance, and causality.
Invariably, each piece reveals elements of both sign and shift, given the intertwined
nature of the two ideas. Yet most of the pieces seemed to fall to one side of the divide
or the other. We hope this structure helps readers appreciate both the conditions and
the consequences of life in the Marianas today.

Signs
In Chapter 1, Mary Therese Perez Hattori offers a framework for authentic and
culturally sustaining leadership that could benefit both CHamoru heritage individ-
uals and the American institutions in which they work. The framework harnesses
CHamoru cultural precepts to facilitate authentic leadership in academic institu-
tions while maintaining cultural heritage, and thereby proposing an alternative to
Western models and ideals of leadership—models and ideals often at odds with
CHamoru and other Indigenous cultures.

In the next chapter, Ajani Burrell chronicles the recent explosion of local clothing
brands in the region, with a particular focus on the CNMI, and explores to what
degree this explosion is a manifestation of cultural pride. He finds that the dynamics
of the local clothing market are complex and suggests several contributing factors
for the exceptional popularity of these types of brands.

Chapter 3, by Anne Perez Hattori, analyzes how recent novels set in the Marianas
represent—and sometimes misrepresent—the people, habitat, and culture of the
region. The essay also assesses the historical veracity of the novels, and posits that
the histories represented in these novels are not always fair or ethical with respect to
the culture they purport to depict.

Royce Camacho explores the notion of mamåhlao in CHamoru culture in Chapter
4. Drawing upon thinkers from Plato to Foucault, and punctuated by local anecdotes
and illustrations, Camacho examines manifestations and implications of mamåhlao
in the classroom and in the tourism-driven gift shop, among other settings.

In Chapter 5, Gerard van Gils recounts an anecdote from his first year teaching high
school in Saipan, and uses that experience to explore some vital cultural and social
issues that create challenges not just for the education system, but for most insti-
tutions in the region.

Tabitha Caser Espina examines identity formation for third-generation Filipinos in
Guam in Chapter 6. She takes a multidisciplinary approach that employs autoeth-
nography and the analysis of poems written by two Guamanian poets. Espina utilizes
the popular Filipino dessert halo-halo as a metaphor to underpin her assessment
that this generation of Filipino immigrants in Guam undergoes a significant degree
of “mixing” as they negotiate their identity formation.

In a series of poems that comprise Chapter 7, Craig Santos Perez explores themes of
Chamorro culture, food, politics, migration, family, ecology, and history.

In Chapter 8, Sharleen Santos-Bamba and Tabitha Espina investigate how
Chamorrita and Filipina women use literacy in different ways as they develop their
identities. The research takes an intergenerational and intercultural approach to
better understand how each of these populations forms its identity and relation-
ships to one another.

Chapter 9, by Mary Therese Perez Hattori, discusses how the author has come to
thrive as a CHamoru transplant in Hawai‘i. In relating her journey, she uses her expe-
riences, scholarly and cultural work, and research to provide strategies for CHamoru
transplants to stay connected to their culture and maintain their cultural identity.

In Chapter 10, Angelyn Labadan explores the reasons behind the notable lack of
arts resources and programming in the CNMI, as well as public perspectives on the
value of art in the community.

Chapter 11, by Poonsri Algaier, paints a picture of contemporary life for the Thais
who remain in Saipan from the large influx of immigrants during the boom years of
the garment industry.

In Chapter 12, Lisa Linda S. Natividad examines family violence in the Marianas and
offers a framework that includes historical trauma and traditional CHamoru con-
cepts of the family system to better understand the deeper dimensions of this issue.
She also discusses some of the implications for social service practitioners, with the
goal of developing more effective and culturally appropriate intervention practices.

Shifts
In Chapter 13, Kenneth Gofigan Kuper provides a segue from Signs to Shifts through
an exploration of multiculturalism in present-day Guåhan. Kuper posits that multi-
culturalism is just the latest manifestation of settler colonialism designed to deprive
Indigenous CHamorus of agency and independence in their homeland. As part of
his analysis, Kuper chronicles key aspects of the colonial history of Guåhan and
examines the role of a pivotal court case in reinforcing the more negative impacts of
multiculturalism on the island.

In the next chapter, Dominique B. Hess examines ongoing language change in the
largest and most populous island of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, in particular the influence of the English language on the local community

and languages. Her research highlights the tensions that underpin the shifting lan-
guage landscape in Saipan, and notes the emergence of a distinct, local variety of
English that reflects these tensions.

Chapter 15, by Victoria-Lola M. Leon Guerrero, recounts the heart-rending story of
trying to process the loss of her first child shortly after his birth. In reckoning with
her grief, she experiences a spiritual transformation born out of a conflict between
her Indigenous culture and her Catholic upbringing.

Tricia Lizama explores the current state of traditional healing in the Marianas in
Chapter 16. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with more than 40 traditional
healers in the region, this essay contours the worldview of the Mariana Islands healer.
Lizama also chronicles developments in 21st century traditional healing, and in so
doing, provides a glimpse of what the future of this millennia-old practice may hold.

In Chapter 17, Sylvia C. Frain examines the way in which CHamoru and Refaluwasch
women are spearheading the resistance to militarization in the Marianas region.
The article presents three distinct examples of these efforts and highlights critical
factors that that help foster and propagate the resistance.

Chapter 18, by Ajani Burrell, examines a particular and perplexing change in
neighborly dynamics in Rota. Interviews with Rota residents, along with historical
and demographic information, help to inform a narrative that explores the
phenomenon of Rota residents becoming increasingly unlikely to ask small favors
of their neighbors. The essay also discusses some possible causes of this change, as
perceived by residents themselves.

Theresa “Isa” Arriola argues in Chapter 19 that the people of the CNMI should re-
consider how they conceptualize sovereignty. At the heart of this reconsideration is
the role and interpretation of the CNMI Covenant. She advances the idea that con-
ceptions of sovereignty in the CNMI should be rooted in Indigenous epistemologies
rather than Western ones, which could result in a more fluid and effective sovereign-
ty for the people, one that resists future militarization and opens the door to a more
expansive interpretation of the CNMI’s political status.

In the next chapter, Cinta Matagolai Kaipat investigates notions of respeto (respect)
in Refaluwasch (Carolinian) culture and how it has changed over the past three gen-
erations. As a bedrock of Refaluwasch culture, respeto influences or impacts many
other aspects of the culture, several of which are discussed here in this wide-ranging
examination. Kaipat asserts that the erosion of respeto over the past three genera-
tions has been swift and precipitous, with dire consequences for the culture —both
present and future—should the decline not be remedied.

Chapter 21, by Malcolm Johnson, highlights the changes affecting the Talakhaya
watershed in Rota. He reports on several aspects of his time in Rota while working
as a National Coral Reef Management Fellow, including the shifting human rela-
tionships to the watershed, local perspectives on the watershed and programs to
help sustain it, and the challenges—human and environmental—facing this vital
feature of Rota’s ecology.

To conclude, Kelly G. Marsh-Taitano, in Chapter 22, explores the dynamics that have
produced the multiethnic and multicultural island that is Guåhan today. As part of
this exploration, Marsh highlights recent demographic shifts, as well as some of the
impacts these shifts are having on life and people in Guåhan.

CHamoru Leadership Lessons (Mary Therese Perez Hattori)

Born and raised on Guam, I am one of nine children of Fermina Leon Guerrero
Perez and Paul Mitsuo Hattori. I moved to O‘ahu after I graduated from high school
in 1983 to further my education at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM). I
completed a baccalaureate degree in Secondary Social Studies with a concentra-
tion in Pacific Islands History, a Professional Diploma in Secondary Social Studies,
a master’s degree in Educational Technology, and a Doctor of Education degree in
Professional Educational Practice.

While in college, I took several jobs at UHM, progressing from positions as a student
employee during my undergraduate studies, to professional positions as a computer
specialist, academic advisor, lecturer, and professor in the fields of computer sci-
ence, information technology, educational technology, and teacher education. For
over 10 years, I was Technology Director at Kapi‘olani Community College, the

largest community college in the University of Hawai‘i system, and currently I serve
as Interim Director of the Pacific Islands Development Program.

Crosscurrents of Culture
Early in my career, I struggled with being a teacher and leader, trapped in the
crosscurrents of two cultures—CHamoru and American. My teacher training and
leadership development programs promoted American principles and practices that
often ran counter to my Native cultural ideals. Individualism, ambition, competi-
tion, and rapid decision-making were valued over communal identity, collaboration,
and deliberate, tradition-honoring decision-making. An individual’s accumulation
of material wealth and increased social status were key factors in academic and
career planning; colleges even supply students and parents with charts showing
the highest paying college majors and lifetime salary-earning potential based on
college degrees. Students are encouraged to select majors as soon as possible, while
exploring a variety of disciplines is strongly discouraged with institutional policies
such as the practice of placing students on academic warning if they do not declare
an academic major by the time they are sophomores. Education is not viewed as a
developmental process that may take time, but a means to rapid degree completion
and lucrative employment.

In the initial phase of my career, I engaged in teaching educators a curriculum based
on American principles, all the while ignoring ways that a program of study may con-
tradict my own Indigenous ways, beliefs, and standards. I also participated in several
leadership development programs that were grounded in ideals and customs of US
society. These programs promoted a variety of Western leadership models such as
Breakthrough Leadership, Sustainable Leadership, and Adaptive Leadership, and
provided examples from American institutions such as the military, for-profit corpo-
rations, and politics. There was no acknowledgement of culture, which is a critical
aspect of leadership, as noted by Chamorro-Premuzic and Sanger (2016).
     
Although the core ingredients of leadership are universal (good judgment,
integrity, and people skills), the full recipe for successful leadership requires cul-
ture-specific condiments. The main reason for this is that cultures differ in their
implicit theories of leadership, the lay beliefs about the qualities that individuals
need to display to be considered leaders.

For a time, I was caught in opposing cultural crosscurrents and believed that as a
CHamoru living in the United States, survival and success would depend on the abil-
ity to set aside my own culture and live up to expectations of the dominant American
society. Faculty in institutions of higher education in the state of Hawai‘i are largely
judged by individual effort; tenure and promotion in many fields requires publica-
tion of articles or books authored as an individual, not as a co-author. There are no
mechanisms to support team-teaching by hiring more than one faculty member to
teach a course. Documents submitted for contract renewal, tenure, and promotion
must be written in a self-centered and I-focused style that highlights one’s individual
accomplishments. People like me who come from societies that value humility and
a communal identity are advised to use “I” and “me” rather than “us” and “we,” and
are instructed to remove all self-effacing and modest language from our documents
because those may be viewed negatively by peer and administrative reviewers. In
one promotion application, I ignored this advice and crafted statements that reflect-
ed my unit’s collective identity, including the statement, “Many of my professional
accomplishments are the result of helping others make connections to the infor-
mation, resources, decision-makers, and skills they need to realize their objectives
and contribute to the achievement of organizational goals.” This approach was not
well-received, and one reviewer complained that he could not distinguish my identi-
ty and my achievements from the identity and achievements of the department I led.
In my view as a leader of one of the largest units on the campus, the development
of a communal identity was a positive achievement, and as a good leader my pro-
fessional successes were possible because of the group’s efforts and support. I was
directed to provide a supplemental statement reframing my leadership philosophy
and accomplishments from an individual perspective. This was a wholly inauthen-
tic document but a requirement to move my promotion application forward, so I
complied with this request. This is but one example of cultural expectations of the
dominant society being imposed on my professional life and producing a living
contradiction in which my values were denied in my workplace (McNiff, 2013, p. 35).
These conflicts motivated me to find ways to validate and legitimate my CHamoru
culture in leadership. To be authentic and to honor my heritage, I used Western
models such as Robert Greenleaf’s Servant Leadership and Authentic Leadership
as conceptual bridges, stepping-stones to understanding that allowed my American
colleagues and superiors to see and understand the value of a culture-based lead-
ership praxis. With these Western-based constructs of Servant Leadership and

Authentic Leadership, I was able to navigate antagonistic crosscurrents and articu-
late those CHamoru approaches which make me a better leader. These approaches
can be helpful models for others; our Native ways and wisdom can also be used to
mitigate problems of American culture and colonization.

Riding the Currents: Culturally Sustaining Leadership
The work of educator Django Paris provides another way for me to advocate for
cultural authenticity in American schools and workplaces. Paris (2012) asserts that
our schools can “support young people in sustaining the cultural and linguistic
competence of their communities while simultaneously offering access to dominant
cultural competence” (p. 95). In other words, culturally sustaining education enables
students to retain and sustain their cultures while learning the skills needed to suc-
ceed in the dominant culture. Paris and Alim (2014) state, “equity and access can best
be achieved by centering pedagogies on the heritage and contemporary practices of
students and communities of color” (p. 87).

Culturally sustaining leadership means leveraging the best parts of my CHamoru
identity and culture in enacting an effective leadership practice and permitting
those I lead to honor their heritages while succeeding in their respective jobs. Even
in the midst of foreign institutions we can use aspects of our culture to be effective
leaders wherever we are, at home or away.

Authentically CHamoru Leadership
As stated earlier, literature on the topic of authenticity in leadership was an im-
portant conceptual bridge allowing for CHamoru ways to be integrated into my
professional practice. Avolio and Gardner (2005) suggest that authentic leadership
is a foundational or root construct which “forms the basis for what then constitutes
other forms of positive leadership” (p. 328). Authenticity is required of leaders; in
fact, “Leadership calls us to be authentic: to be true to ourselves and be true to
the world” (Terry, 1993, p. 189). CHamoru culture thus forms the foundation of my
leadership philosophy and guides my decisions and conduct. Terry (1993) writes,
“Authenticity informs and directs action; action grounds authenticity in life. …
Without authenticity, action drifts. Without action, authenticity remains idle con-
jecture and wishful thinking” (p. 138). In this essay I highlight two cultural elements
that I have integrated into my leadership praxis. This act of articulation is also an act of authentic leadership; leaders must identify and share their values with their
followers (Aponte-Moreno, 2014).

Belonging
As CHamorus, we practice and prioritize belonging; it is a notable aspect of our cul-
ture that can have a transformational impact on organizational culture. Like many
people of the Pacific, CHamorus are oriented toward a communal identity which
gives everyone a sense of recognition and belonging. Belonging, as described by
Spiller and Wolfgramm (2015) “embraces spiritual ideals of interconnectedness and
relationality” (p. 305). A primary lesson I learned throughout my childhood was that
everyone is a valued member of the family and the greater society simply by virtue
of being born and that nothing I did or did not do could eradicate my status as a
CHamoru. A strong sense of security comes from being born into a state of belong-
ing and it is “a defining source of happiness and is central to well-being, meaning,
and purpose” (Spiller & Wolfgramm, 2015, p. 303). We do have high standards and
aspirations for our children and ourselves, but achievements such as material
wealth or social status are not measures of worth and acceptance.

Members of cultures that are individualistic rather than communal often struggle
for recognition and belonging. It is a source of great concern noted by Swiss philos-
opher de Botton (2005), who says “it is an almost universal anxiety: an anxiety about
what others think of us; about whether we’re judged a success or a failure, a winner
or a loser” (p. vii).

The famous medical doctor Oliver Sacks was impressed by this ethos of belong-
ing after having visited Guam while investigating the disease Lytico-Bodig. In an
interview with TV Ontario’s Allan Gregg (2010), Dr. Sacks spoke of an “immensely
different and moving sense of belonging” and contrasted CHamoru and American
responses to disease:
     
One of the horrors of disease in American communities, especially with those
who have severe degenerative diseases, is that one gets isolated, abandoned,
stigmatized, marginalized and falls out of the world. On Guam, I never saw that.
People would remain completely part of the family and community, a full person
right to the last. If they had to go to the hospital, the whole family would go with

them. The hospital was like a village. Everyone is integrated all the while, even
before Lytico-Bodig. In this way, they are much more civilized than we are.
These social problems mentioned by de Botton and Sacks are caused by a lack of and
struggle for recognition and belonging and are uncommon in our islands, which
have a strong spirit of belonging. Perhaps this CHamoru tradition is an antidote for
these social woes (Hattori, 2016).

Educational researchers note a connection between academic success and a sense of
belonging in school. They note, “Feeling part of a school or classroom community
has significant psychological benefits for students and makes them more likely to
engage in productive academic behaviors” (Farrington et al., 2012, p. 28). An example
of putting belonging into practice is to infuse program orientation with the CHamoru
ethos of belonging. I tell students in orientation programs that by virtue of admis-
sion, they belong. In a highly selective educational leadership doctoral program at
UH, I remind new students, many in positions of leadership and all over-achievers,
that they need not worry about proving themselves; instead, they should focus their
efforts on improving themselves. Former students have remarked that these assur-
ances of belonging were among the most affirming moments in their orientation and
for some, gave them a new sense of freedom they do not necessarily have in their
professional lives. As an educator, I felt responsible for creating a sense of belonging
in the classroom and relational accountability to my students. This requires estab-
lishing a relationship with the students to the greatest extent possible given limited
class time and office hours. I fostered belonging through team-building, collaborative
learning pedagogies, and engendering in students a sense of responsibility for the
learning of others. This awareness of doing good for the benefit of others or the ben-
efit of the whole is typical of CHamoru culture where older siblings nurture younger
siblings, where youth are taught to be mindful of the needs of elders.

These benefits of a culture of belonging apply to the workplace as well as schools;
employee engagement has been linked to a sense of belonging. This can be achieved
by a leadership that affirms each employee’s suitability for the unit, prioritizing a
communal identity, and engendering collaboration rather than competition. In the
workplace, I fostered a communal identity at several levels by organizing employees
into functional teams, creating project teams that include people from across dif-
ferent functional teams, and by ensuring regular team and departmental meetings.

The meetings had several purposes for each functional team: to inform others of
their work, to recognize and acknowledge achievements of individuals and teams,
and to maintain awareness of departmental and organizational goals. Employees
develop professional identities as members of a functional team and as members
of the department as a whole. The word “we” was used more often than “I” or “me,”
and as the unit head, I always reported the department’s achievements as collective
accomplishments. These team and department meetings were a commitment to
fostering relationships among professionals who might not work directly with each
other on a regular basis, and generated a sense of collective identity and account-
ability. As the head of the unit, I was not only accountable to the institution, but was
also able to use the collective identity to impart a relational accountability to my
employees. As an educator and leader, I have seen the ideal of belonging transform
and empower students and employees.

Cultural Metaphors
Like many Indigenous people, CHamorus communicate using analogy and met-
aphor, which are powerful tools for educators and leaders. Philosopher Ortega y
Gasset (2019) says, “The metaphor is probably the most fertile power possessed by
man” (p. 33). We gain and transmit knowledge through analogy and metaphor. On
metaphors as a leadership tool, Terry (1993) writes, they “open paths for understand-
ing human discourse” (p. 68). Metaphors “open windows onto reality” (p. 160). Our
culture is replete with powerful metaphors that illuminate CHamoru ways of being;
here I share two that can be applied to leadership—latte and wayfinding.

The latte—stone house-posts used in ancient CHamoru society—is an important
cultural icon and can be a metaphor for strength, support, foundations, and the
strength borne of unification. The latte is created through the combination of haligi
house-post and tåsa capstone; latte standing in groups can form strong structural
foundations. Leaders use this iconic image to inspire unity, connection, and relation-
al accountability. I have employed this metaphor in several instances, sometimes
sharing the chant, “Ini Na Latte” by Leonard Iriarte as a call for unity. I have shared
it in speeches to Pacific Islanders in Hawai‘i and on the mainland in programs such
as the National Pacific American Leadership Institute (NAPALI), a leadership de-
velopment program hosted annually in Hawai‘i for emerging Indigenous leaders,
and the City College of San Francisco’s Talanoa program, which hosts public events

bringing those of Pacific Islander heritage in San Francisco together for periodic
talks by noted Pacific Islanders. Another commonly used metaphorical device
comes from the revival of the traditional canoe sailing, which inspires the use of
navigation as a metaphor. We often talk about navigating successfully in school,
in college, in the workplace, and life. Goals and vision can be communicated as
important destinations. Leaders, mentors, parents, and friends can be described
as celestial bodies that provide guidance, or as winds, tides, and currents helping
others reach their destinations.

Communicating organizational goals through metaphor is an effective leadership
skill. Terry (1993) notes a connection between leadership, metaphors, and authenticity:
     Leadership calls us to be authentic: to be true to ourselves and be true to the
     world. In order to be true to ourselves, we must look at any misalignment that
     exists between our professed metaphor and the behavior that is entailed by
     that metaphor. (p. 189)

Closing Reflection
An authentic professional life, grounded in culturally sustaining practices such as
belonging and the use of metaphor, and other cultural elements not addressed here
such as chenchule', respect for manåmko', and temporal intelligence, has made me
a more successful leader and educator (Hattori, 2016). Beyond my own profession-
al growth, sharing and modeling culturally sustaining leadership in professional
development workshops enable me to contribute to change in the people and in-
stitutions I serve. There is recognition of the worth of our Indigenous knowledge
applied to organizational culture. The Native cultures of the Mariana Islands are
rich in positive customs and values that can benefit others and make this world a
better place. Let’s identify, articulate, and practice the best elements of our culture
and share them, enriching ourselves and everyone else in the process.

Culturally sustaining leadership brings to mind an account of the Greek myth of
Narcissus in a novel by Coelho (1993). In the legend, the young man is so enraptured
by his reflection in a lake that he cannot look away, falls into the water, and drowns.

When Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found that the
lake, which had been fresh water, was transformed into a lake of salty tears. “Why
do you weep?” the goddesses asked. “I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied. “Ah,
it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for though we always
pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.”
“But … was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked. “Who better than you to know
that?” the goddesses said in wonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt
each day to contemplate himself!” The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it
said, “I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep
because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes,
my own beauty reflected” (p. ix).

Culturally sustaining leadership provides ways leaders can give their followers this
kind of experience—so that in our workplaces, our activities, and in our personal
encounters, they see reflections of their own beauty.

Repping the Marianas: Cultural Pride and the Rise of Mariana Islands-Inspired Clothing Brands (Ajani Burrell)

In 2017, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or CNMI, had an
estimated 52,000 inhabitants (Central Intelligence Agency, 2018). The CNMI is an
archipelago of fourteen islands stretching across hundreds of miles in the northwest
Pacific Ocean, but the population largely resides on three islands: Saipan, Tinian,
and Rota. These three islands are marked by diverse geography that includes ele-
vated limestone plateaus, valleys, cliffs, rocky and sandy beaches of various sizes,
and large swaths of thick jungle, but cover in total just 116 square miles. This total
land area is about one-fifth the size of O‘ahu, and about one-tenth the size of
Rhode Island, the smallest of the United States, while the CNMI’s population is just
one-twentieth that of Rhode Island.

Though the area and population density are relatively small, the CNMI holds an
abundance of beautiful beaches and natural scenery. Over half a million tourists
flock annually to the islands (Marianas Visitors Authority, 2018), which are home to
a variety of cultures and communities, including at least eight different Pacific Island

groups and people from more than half a dozen Asian countries (US Census Bureau,
2011). The CNMI also has something else in abundance: local clothing brands. In
2018, the people of the CNMI could choose from more than 20 local clothing brands,
an astounding number for a population of only 52,000 people. Even more astound-
ing is that of these twenty-plus brands, no fewer than 13 of them are located in or
were founded in the CNMI.

To put this situation into context, imagine the town of La Crosse, WI (estimated 2017
population: 51,834) or Palm Desert, CA (52, 932), or Valdosta, GA (56,085) (US Census
Bureau, 2017). Imagine if thirteen different companies were producing and selling
distinct La Crosse-related clothing and accessories in La Crosse (or Palm Desert or
Valdosta). Try to imagine visiting a place where half the population is wearing an
article of clothing that depicts or represents some aspect of the local culture. How
many people on a given day in La Crosse, WI, are wearing clothing that represents
La Crosse or its culture? Even iconic and populous cities such as New York or Los
Angeles do not see such rates. The only location that seems even remotely analo-
gous would be a college campus, where a significant portion of the student body on
any given day is wearing clothing associated with the institution. Such is the perva-
sive nature of the local clothing brand movement in the Marianas.

What are local clothing brands? For the purposes of this chapter, local clothing
brands (LCBs) are those that produce and sell clothing and accessories that relate
directly to the Marianas region, which includes both the CNMI and Guam, a neigh-
boring US territory to the south. These LCBs are designed by people who live in
or come from the Marianas region. More importantly, the designs for these brands
represent some aspect of life or culture in the region, and are all marketed to people
who live in the region or come from the region.

While a plethora of LCBs exists today, only two or three such brands existed as recent-
ly as 2005, barely 15 years ago. Then a veritable explosion of LCBs occurred around
2015, when entrepreneurs launched or rebooted some of the largest CNMI-based
brands still in existence today. For Marianas residents then, the growth was obvious.
It seemed—and still seems—that at least half the population at any given moment
is wearing a product from one of these brands. Why have these brands—and their
popularity—proliferated so quickly? And what can this growth tell us about the
people and the culture of the Mariana Islands today?

Clothing, Culture, Values, and Identity
Clothing, in particular dress and fashion, is a public display of culture, values, and
identity. In recent decades, scholars from a multitude of academic disciplines—in-
cluding philosophy, economics, geography, cultural studies, and sociology, among
others—have contributed to the interdisciplinary study of fashion (Aspers & Godart,
2013, p. 175). Crane and Bovone (2006) posited that fashion can serve as an example
of the connection between symbolic values and material culture, and that “material
goods express values; consumption of these goods is a means for the consumer to
communicate messages about the values she holds” (p. 320). The study of clothing
as a value-laden material good has a long history, dating back to the 1930s, accord-
ing to Hsu and Burns (2012), who built on the work of Allport, Vernon, and Linday
(1951, 1960). Hsu and Burns—following earlier writers Blackwell, Miniard, and
Engel (2001), Hofestede (1994), and Lapitsky (1961), among others—put this value
formation in a cultural context, asserting that values, including cultural values, “are
learned and can shape our consumer behavior, which includes clothing selection”
(pp. 1585–1587). Since culture shapes clothing choices and clothing choices can
thereby reflect values, an examination of the clothing or fashion choices of a culture
can potentially reveal some of the values at work in a culture.

Similarly, clothing as a means to understand and examine identity (both personal and
cultural) has been well documented. Giddens (1991) asserted that “dress is vastly more
than simply a means of bodily protection: it is, manifestly, a means of symbolic display,
a way of giving external form to narratives of self-identity” (p. 62). Crane and Bovone
(2006), following earlier work by Giddens (1991), Goffman (1961), Bovone (2003), and
others, have argued that the wide variety of fashion choice in today’s society imparts a
sense of agency to the individual, and can be viewed as the individual making a choice
for a particular, meaningful self-identification (p. 323). Crane (2000) posited that
“clothing choices provide an excellent field for studying how people interpret a spe-
cific form of culture for their own purposes” (p. 1). Other scholars have also examined
the connection between identity and personal values (Hitlin & Piliavin, 2004, p. 382).

History of Marianas Dress
As with many other aspects of life in the Marianas, clothing and dress can be viewed
within the historical dynamics of three major eras: pre-European contact, colonial
occupation, and the post-colonial period. Reports from the first European contact,
Magellan’s 1521 visit, and from the ensuing decades indicate that the Indigenous
Chamorros were scantily clothed. Flores (2010) stated that men generally went with-
out clothing, while “most observers noted women wearing at minimum a leaf (tifi')
attached to a cord around their waists, or a piece of paper-thin bark (gunut), which
covered their private parts” (p. 508). Flores also cited reports describing regular use
of natural accessories from both land and sea as adornment, body modification, or
indication of social status.

Indigenous dress began to shift radically in the late 17th century when Spain es-
tablished colonial occupation, and religious missionaries came to the islands. In
and around Hagåtña, the present capital of Guam and former headquarters for
the Spanish colonial administration, the Indigenous Chamorros—including men,
women, and children—adopted Spanish clothing, although outside of the capital,
“where contact with religious authority was limited, indigenous attire was still worn”
(Flores, 2010, p. 508). Although the influence of the Spanish Empire weakened over
the 18th and 19th centuries, a Spanish style of dress persisted in the form of the
mestisa, which generally consisted of woven fabric pants and shirts for men and
a kamisola and skirt for women (Flores, 2010, p. 509). George Fritz (2001) reported
similar attire for Chamorros in the Northern Mariana Islands under the German
administration in the early 20th century. Men’s work attire consisted of “short pants
(katsunes) reaching to the knee and a short shirt (chinia) worn over the pants,” while
women wore a “skirt (lupes) … a short blouse (chinina) and a kerchief (paniou-ulo)” (p.
35). However, the Refaluwasch (Carolinians who had settled in Saipan in the early
1800s) resisted the adoption of Spanish-style clothing well into the 20th century.
Refaluwasch men wore “a piece of cotton cloth tied between their legs” and women
wore a similar cloth, only wider and wrapped around their hips (Craddock, 1982).
Outside influences, including from the Japanese, who administered the Northern
Mariana Islands between WWI and WWII, would continue to affect dress styles
through the 20th century, though Flores (2010) noted that the style throughout the
archipelago remained largely “consistent despite political changes between the
Northern Mariana Islands and Guam” (p. 510).

Americanization during the post-WWII period marked another shift in dress styles,
with American styles predominating. More recently, dress styles in the Mariana
Islands have been impacted by the globalization of the clothing and textile indus-
try, with a wide variety of brands available for purchase. In the late 20th century,
a “renaissance of Chamorro language and culture began” that, in part, resulted in
an “interest in redefining Chamorro identity via the use of ‘heritage’ items” (Flores,
2010, p. 510). This fusion of American influence and renewed interest in Chamorro
identity provides the historical context for an examination of the eventual rise of
local clothing brands, the focus of this research.

Local Clothing Brands and Cultural Pride in the Marianas
To explore the scope and background of local clothing brands of the Marianas, I
interviewed brand principals and conducted a survey of the Northern Marianas
College community. I also analyzed the symbols, taglines, mottos, and motifs of the
brands to better understand brand goals, as well as the specific cultural signifiers
they employ or embody.

Until the turn of the 21st century, people in the Marianas were largely limited to
clothing designed and produced outside the region. The lifestyle of the islands drew
people to surfing brands such as Quicksilver and Hollister, as well as global compa-
nies such as Nike. Sporadically, local entrepreneurs would produce a limited run of
t-shirts. Often these shirts would be emblazoned with images of Chamorro warriors
or sayings. By most accounts, the local clothing brand movement has its origins at
the beginning of the 21st century, with the founding of Fotten Gäga' in the CNMI
and Fökai Industries in Guam. According to their respective Facebook pages, Fotten
Gäga' was founded in 2001, while Fökai Industries opened its first store in 2003. Both
brands are still in operation today and retain their early popularity. Around 2005,
the first big wave of local clothing brands began, and over the next few years more
brands were launched, including Rocksteady (Magas/Mas Magas, 670, Deepside,
Stressfree), Chokechain, Atdit, Poksu, Marianas Built, and Salbahe'. A second wave
of brands launched around 2015, including Trendsetters, Legends, Roil Soil, and,
perhaps the most popular CNMI brand today, Tribe Marianas.

Since 2005 or so, more than two dozen local clothing brands have launched in the
Marianas, with many setting up shop in the CNMI. One goal shared among nearly
all these brands is a desire to positively represent the people, culture, and region to
the world. A common theme in interviews with owners and designers of some of
the best-known local brands was their concern over the general lack of knowledge
about the Marianas and her people in the wider world, particularly the mainland
United States. Often, Islanders find that when they visit the United States, few
people have heard of the Marianas or know much about a region that comprises two
US territories and boasts some of the highest rates in the country of enlistment in
the US armed forces (Hicks, 2014; Weare & Cruz, 2017). Misperceptions are common,
and people from the mainland may wonder whether people in the Mariana Islands
wear grass skirts, or whether they have McDonald’s and the Internet. Consequently,
according to Tribe Marianas co-founder Rob Travilla (personal communication,
May 8, 2017), “one of the major—if not first—missions of Tribe Marianas, is to spread
the Marianas worldwide, so hopefully one day we no longer need to introduce our-
selves.” Many brands express a similar sentiment in their online descriptions. Fökai,
one of the largest brands in the Marianas, describes itself as “an imminent venture
to present the native people of the Mariana Islands to the world as an intelligent,
persevering, and respectful and respectable community” (Fokai Industries, n.d.a),
while the Rocksteady shop was founded “in an attempt to promote and represent the
culture, people and life of the Marianas” (irocksteady, n.d.a). Eric Palacios (personal
communication, December 4, 2017), creator of the Atdit and Trendsetters brands,
agrees, and believes that the “common goal” for all of the brands in the Mariana
Islands is to represent the islands.

Symbols, Taglines, and Motifs
Brands achieve the goal of representing the people and culture of the Marianas
in distinct ways, but they all share a concerted effort to infuse aspects of the local
culture into each brand. For most, this starts with the company or brand name.
Some have chosen to incorporate explicit references to the region, such as Tribe
Marianas, 670 (the telephone area code for the CNMI), MarianasBuilt, Chamorrita
Swimwear (Chamorrita refers to young Chamorro women; it is also the name of
an ancient song style in the Marianas), Hafaloha (“Hafa” is the first word of the
Chamorro greeting “Hafa Adai”), and Hafa Brand. Others chose a specific word or
phrase from Chamorro (Table 1).

(personal communication, December 4, 2017).

This dedication to representing the Marianas people and culture is also evident in
brand taglines and logos, as well as the symbols and images that appear in the de-
signs. The tagline for Tribe Marianas, for example, is “Divided By Tide x United By
Pride,” a reference to the demography and geography of the region, the fact that a
significant portion of the Indigenous people from Guam and the CNMI now reside
in the US mainland, and the shared cultural pride of people from the Marianas.
Other taglines from Tribe Marianas include “Common Tradition, Common Culture,
Commonwealth,” in reference to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, and “XV Deep,” referring to the 15 islands of the Marianas chain and their
proximity to the Marianas Trench, the deepest place on earth. Other brands echo
this cultural sentiment. Roil Soil’s motto is “Rep Your Soil,” which, according to lead
designer Peter Aldan (personal communication, January 25, 2018), means to “repre-
sent your homeland and culture, to have pride” in the Marianas as a place of origin.
A motto for Crowns Guam reads, “Our Waters Run Deep. Our Roots Run Deeper.”

While taglines and mottos often express geographical or cultural pride elements,
the logos of the companies usually depict cultural heritage artifacts. Perhaps the

most common symbol is the latte stone (Figure 1), which figures prominently in the
history and culture of the islands. It appears at the center of the official CNMI seal
(Figure 2) and in the logos of brands including Legends (Figure 3), Atdit, and Magas.
The Tribe Marianas logo includes two crossed adzes, a carving tool of the ancient
Chamorros (Figure 4). Some logos, such as those of Roil Soil and Fotten Gäga', fea-
ture native plants, while others include iconic symbols of the culture, such as spears.

The products displayed on the websites of the various brands illustrate many of the
popular aspects of Marianas culture and history, from marine activities like surfing,
outrigger paddling, and spearfishing, to local flora and fauna. Cultural expressions
(Table 2) include traditional Chamorro sayings and phrases, as well as references to
both contemporary and historical characteristics of the islands.

life in the Marianas.

Influences: Producers and Consumers
While examination of the brands and their products reveals an abundant use of cul-
tural, geographic, and geopolitical features of the region, interviews with the brand
principals reveal that such thematic foci are conscious choices tailored to a local
population. As Pete Aldan (personal communication, January 25, 2018) said about
the design influences for Roil Soil, we try to incorporate the mindset of the islander, one who practices patience
and enjoys the simpler things in life. There is definitely a connection between
us and our natural environment. The Chamorros and Carolinians can be de-
fined by the islands—interconnected, small, yet diverse and beautiful.
This sentiment applies not only to Indigenous descendants, but to just about anyone
who calls the Marianas home. When asked who the customers of Tribe Marianas
are, co-founder Rob Travilla (personal communication, May 8, 2017) said,
When you define the word tribe it’s basically a group of people with common in-
terests or common tradition or common culture … and I feel like even if you’ve
only lived on Saipan for a week but if you say, “man I love the beaches, I love the
culture, I love the food,” it automatically connects you to Saipan, and wearing
a Tribe Marianas shirt makes you feel like you will always be a part of the tribe.
In my interviews with brand principals, they affirmed their strong bond with their
home in the Mariana Islands, and their conviction that their customer base shares
that affinity. That local loyalty seems in part to be driving the popularity of the brands.

Whatever the reason for their popularity, the broad appeal of the local brands is
apparent. In addition to the anecdotal evidence gathered from interviews with
owners and designers of the brands—mostly boutique brands with intimate cus-
tomer relationships—I conducted a survey in December 2017 of consumers of LCBs
in the Marianas. Among the 154 respondents from the Northern Marianas College
community, nearly 4 out of 5 (78.3%) indicated that they purchased or wore products
from one or more LCBs. Of those respondents, 76% indicated that they purchased or
wore products from at least two LCBs, which equates to 60% of all respondents. All
these figures help to confirm the popularity of LCBs in the Marianas.

While the respondents were predominantly aged 18-24 (63.4%), and therefore not
representative of the general population, affirmative response rates were relatively
consistent across the three largest age groups represented in the survey (18-24, 25-34,
and 35-44-year-olds). The survey data, coupled with anecdotal and observational
evidence from brand creators, reinforces the conclusion that these brands have
achieved notable penetration and popularity.

Witnessing this explosion of locally branded and inspired clothing, as well as the per-
vasive use of culturally significant symbols and language by the brands themselves,

one might deduce that the popularity of the brands is an expression of cultural pride,
analogous to the cultural resurgence of local arts described by Flores (2010) and
other regional scholars. After centuries of colonial control by Spain, Japan, Germany,
and the United States, and decades under a formal territorial relationship with the
United States, the rise of LCBs in the Marianas signals a move to reclaim and reassert
cultural heritage. Pete Aldan (personal communication, January 25, 2018), speaking
on the influences of the Roil Soil brand, expressed precisely this sentiment:
     
     Our history of being colonized and not being given the chance to exist as our
     own, our own identity and voice. Roil means to “stir up,” and we like to think
     that we are stirring up our people and our culture to do more, wake up and live.
     Of course, it’s a play on words, roil meaning what it is as well as “royal,” giving
     immense value to our soil, our land.

As Flores (2010) has noted, the cultural resurgence in the Marianas began in the
1970s and has continued since then, invigorating various aspects of the culture,
from language and traditional practices such as maritime navigation and healing, to
environmentalism and political self-determination. The rise of LCBs, from the late
1990s to the present day, has similarly manifested this cultural resurgence. Several
respondents in the survey indicated that cultural pride was a motivating factor in
their choice of personal favorite brands or their pick of the most popular brand.
Sixteen percent of all respondents to the question “Why is this your favorite brand?”
gave an answer that expressed cultural pride. Likewise, respondents to the question
“Why do you think that X brand is so popular?” gave answers such as, “It represents
the whole Chamorro community,” “Local pride,” “The designs … represent the
CNMI,” “Each design has an aspect of the CNMI,” and “Because they express pride
and culture.” Furthermore, 85% of all respondents agreed or strongly agreed with
the statements that “Local clothing/lifestyle brands are more popular today than
ever before” and “When people wear local clothing/lifestyle brands they show their
pride in the CNMI.” Almost 75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement that “Today, people from the CNMI have pride in being from the CNMI.”
All of these results underscore the strong connection between these brands and
cultural pride in the region.

Beyond Local Culture The consumer surveys, and the statements by brand principals, also reveal that other
key factors besides cultural pride are likely at play. While both brand principals and
consumers recognized the role of cultural pride in the recent rise of LCBs, they also
pointed out that cultural pride is not a recent phenomenon of the Marianas. Eric
Palacios (personal communication, December 4, 2017) shared his belief that the
“sense of [cultural] pride” was always there in the people of the Marianas, whether
living in the islands or in the mainland. Shayne Villanueva (personal communica-
tion, March 5, 2018) concurred, stating that “Chamorro people are the proudest,”
and part of the success of Roil Soil and other brands is attributable to people always
wanting to share that pride. The great majority of survey respondents expressed a
similar viewpoint, that people of the Marianas are proud of their home and cul-
ture, and they display that pride when wearing local brands. However, only 59%
of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that “The people of
the CNMI have more pride in being from the CNMI than at any other time I can
remember,” while 75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement
that “Today, the people of the CNMI have pride in being from the CNMI.” These
findings suggest that while cultural pride may be a key factor in the rise of LCBs, the
feeling of cultural pride is not a sentiment specific to this particular time, but was
also prevalent in other recent historical periods. Other factors than cultural pride
are likely fueling the growth in popularity of LCBs.

Interviews with some of the key principals behind the brands revealed several other
possible drivers of their popularity. One is the influence of urban American culture.
Eric Palacios (personal communication, December 4, 2018), creator of the brands
Atdit and Trendsetters, reflected on the origins of the LCB movement in the Marianas:

      We wanted to rep where we were from, because in Hawai‘i they were repping
      where they were from. When they go—when Hawai‘i people go to the mainland
      or wherever they really wear it loud and proud, Hawai‘i with their flag in the
      back. So we wanted to do the same.

While Palacios sees the cultural pride movement in Hawai‘i as a likely impetus for
Pacific Islanders in the Marianas, more germane here is his use of the words rep and
repping—as in “repping the homeland” or “repping the Marianas”—which come
from the word represent. This word and its meaning are associated with the urban
experience in the mainland United States and signal the quintessential urban ar-
tistic expression: hip-hop. The idea of “repping” is pervasive in urban and hip-hop
culture. One reps their “hood,” their “set,” their “crew,” their “block,” their “people.”

This reference to repping, and the clear association to urban and hip-hop culture,
was present in many of the interviews with brand principals.

TJ Manglona (personal communication, September 28, 2017), co-founder of Tribe
Marianas, recalled,

     When I was in like the fourth grade, my dad had a collection of CDs, Tupac,
     Dr. Dre—‘The Chronic’, Too $hort, and I’d take that box of CDs and listen to it
     when they [my parents] weren’t home. For me, it was a connection to California,
     to the West Coast. I felt like it made sense for me too. That whole culture has
     always been an influence for me.

TJ’s sentiment was echoed by almost all of the other brand principals interviewed.
Most grew up listening to hip-hop and as fans of hip-hop and urban culture. Several
lived in urban areas such as Oakland or San Diego, and considered hip-hop and
urban culture as strong influences on their designs.

This influence is apparent when we examine the actual brands and products. Many
of the brands reproduce “streetwear,” the fashion embodiment of urban culture.
Crowns Guam’s (n.d.a) website states that they “look to represent the island and our
culture, within the fashion and streetwear realm as the ‘Underground King.’” The
Undeniable (n.d.a), a recent brand that is already attracting a sizeable fan base, pres-
ents its products on its Facebook page as “Superior Island Streetwear.” TJ Manglona
(personal communication, September 28, 2017), speaking about the genesis of the
Tribe Marianas style, said,

     We didn’t necessarily want to impose so much of the hip-hop/urban culture, but
     we wanted to make it so that, if we take our stuff, it’s influenced by the islands, by
     the beauty of our culture, but we also want to present it in a way that makes sense
     in that world [urban], because that’s the world we look up to, that’s the world that
     inspires us, inspired what we love—the music that we love, the fashion that we
     love—we wanted to make it make sense in that world too.

As Marianas LCB designers have taken inspiration from American urban hip-hop cul-
ture, unsurprisingly their most popular items are snapback and fitted baseball caps
and basketball-style jerseys, all of which are trendy with hip-hop artists and the wider
urban community. Among Marianas consumers, it is also no surprise that the brands’
urban-inspired streetwear sells well. Hip-hop and rap are mainstream, as a glance at
the Billboard Top 100 Artists confirms: for the week of June 16th, 2018, for example,
three of the top ten artists were from the world of hip-hop, including the number
one artist for the week, Kanye West (one of the most popular music artists of the last
two decades). The popularity of urban music and culture extends to the Marianas,
and where it has likely been the most popular musical import from the United States
during the 21st century.

While the local brands’ popularity rests on their fusion of urban style and island cul-
ture, another major driver of their success is marketing, chiefly in the form of social
media. Both the brand principals I interviewed and the consumers I surveyed cited
marketing as a key factor. Eric Palacios (personal communication, December 4, 2017)
surmised that “marketing is what really made the big explosion” for local clothing
brands. TJ Manglona (personal communication, September 28, 2017) agreed, indi-
cating that “the boom in social media … got everyone’s eyes open.” Manglona and
Travilla’s Tribe Marianas exemplifies the power of marketing and social media: their
skillful focus on marketing and social media led them, within only 18 months, to
become the most followed company in the CNMI, with more than 10,000 followers
across their various social media platforms and over 30,000 views on their YouTube
channel (R. Travilla, personal communication, May 8, 2017). Their social media
followership is paralleled by brand loyalty: according to the survey I conducted,
Tribe Marianas was the most popular LCB in the CNMI, after just over a year of
full-time operations.

Survey respondents also recognized the singular role of marketing and social media
in the popularity of the brands. While some respondents indicated that cultural pride
or “repping” the islands was a main factor for choosing their personal favorite or the
brand they thought most popular, many more respondents thought that some aspect of
marketing played a primary role. Twenty-four percent of respondents to the question
“Why do you think that X brand is so popular?” named some aspect of marketing (e.g.,
“marketing,” “ads,” “advertising,” “social media”) as the cause of the popularity. This
type of response was by far the most common. Variations on other types of answers—
such as the design of the gear or longevity of the brand—were less common, and
many answers were unique enough not to fit neatly into a category (e.g., “a day won’t
go by without noticing one near by”). More than likely, some other responses, such as
“trendy” or “see them everywhere,” also relate to marketing without explicitly stating
it, thereby increasing the likelihood of marketing as a primary driver of popularity.

Another factor driving the demand for LCBs—cited by brand principals and
confirmed by consumers—is the quality of the products. TJ Manglona (personal com-
munication, September 28, 2017) from Tribe Marianas explained that the CNMI only
recently had anyone “really producing quality goods that could stand up to anything
in the States”. Eric Palacios (personal communication, December 4, 2017) of Atdit
and Legends noted that producers in the CNMI have found a way to “produce every-
thing legit,” from the tags to the stitching to the packaging. As recently as a decade
ago, the majority of local garments were produced by silkscreening designs onto
blank or generic items, predominantly t-shirts and hats. Today, LCBs are capable of
customization and quality production. Shayne Villanueva (personal communication,
March 5, 2018), for example, said that Roil Soil does not mass market their products.
Rather, the brand customizes designs and produces small batches with an attention to
quality, which also serves a marketing purpose found elsewhere in fashion, including
the sneakerhead market. Other brands run their operations similarly. Rob Travilla
(personal communication, September 8, 2018) from Tribe Marianas stressed that the
company’s ethos is quality over quantity. Tribe, like other brands, has turned to sub-
limation printing and cut-and-sewn garments. Tribe even embroiders their garment
tags and utilizes custom tapering and inlays, quality improvements that far exceed the
basic silkscreened products of a decade earlier.

The public has responded to the emphasis on quality. According to the survey
of the NMC community, 9% of respondents cited the quality of a brand as the
primary reason that brand was their favorite. Interestingly, half a dozen different
brands were represented in this group, an indication of the quality of many of the
goods being produced by Marianas LCBs.

Conclusions
Local Mariana Islands clothing brands have grown increasingly popular in recent
years. Much of this popularity stems from the brands’ attention to representing as-
pects of the culture—both traditional and contemporary—and consumers’ feelings
of cultural pride. Yet, those aspects of cultural expression and pride might not be the
most influential drivers of the popularity of these brands, which have also benefited
from the globalization of urban and streetwear styles that influence many of the brand
design choices. A desire from the public for high quality, locally produced garments,
and a parallel commitment by brands to produce quality garments, also contributed to
the popularity of the brands. However, the greatest driver of the local clothing brands’
popularity is likely the marketing enabled by the contemporary global phenomenon
of social media, rather than specific style or quality, or the immense cultural pride
present in the region.

This research project also leaves some questions unanswered. Foremost, what is the
import of these findings? What does it mean that the popularity of these brands
might be driven more by social media marketing than by cultural pride? How du-
rable is a style that relies heavily on cultural expression and signification? Other
questions also arise, particularly about the nature of the cultural pride on display
in the brands and the public that consumes their products. Is that cultural pride
authentic, or mainly a construct of our digital, social media age, the byproduct more
of savvy marketing than cultural pride? Is cultural pride necessary to the popularity
of the brands, sufficient, or both?

This research has affirmed the strong sense of cultural pride within the Marianas,
and that wearing products from local clothing brands is an expression of that pride.
Future research might explore the source of this pride. Where does it come from?
Why is it so strong? Or such research might ask how we can better understand
the complex relationship between local clothing brands and cultural pride in the
Mariana Islands. Exploring some of these questions would deepen our understand-
ing of how the people of the Marianas view themselves and their contemporary
culture in this particular domain.

From Exotica to Erotica: Historical Fiction or Fictional History in Mariana Islands Novels, 2012-2017 (Anne Perez Hattori)

Author Note: In March 2017, I received an email inquiry from Professor Carolina Rodriguez
of the University of Oviedo in Spain, faculty of American literatures and cultures. As part
of a research group studying literature written by American authors about “exotic” places,
she encountered Guam through her discovery of the novel, Conquered: A WWII Erotic
Historical Romance Set in Guam, written by CHamoru writer Paula Lujan Quinene.
Prof. Rodriguez took an interest in Guam’s past and present and emailed to ask me to recom-
mend readings in order to learn more about us and our history. Her curiosity about Guam
and novels about the island spurred me to read Conquered, and from there, other recent
novels. It struck me that as a University of Guam professor who teaches classes in Guam
History and CHamoru Studies, I ought to be familiar with these publications. So, for that bit
of motivation and inspiration, I offer my thanks: Si Yu'os Ma'åse, Prof. Rodriguez.

For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the “Pacific novel” referred to works
by Herman Melville, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Michener, and other Western
writers. More recent decades have seen the emergence of Indigenous novelists, led

by writers such as the late Epeli Hau’ofa of Tonga, Albert Wendt (Samoa), Sia Figiel
(Samoa), and Patricia Grace (Aotearoa New Zealand Māori). Indeed, fictional works
about islands in the South Pacific—that is, Oceanic islands below the equator—have
proliferated over the past 40 years.¹ The same, however, could not be said of our
region, as is attested by the near absence of Micronesian novels in Pacific Literature
classes across the region.² Since 2012, however, more than 10 novels have been pub-
lished that feature the Mariana Islands, the CHamoru people, and our Indigenous
culture, including four written by Natives and five others by authors who at one time
resided here. These novels make heavy use of island landscapes, CHamoru legends,
and Marianas history, sometimes as mere backdrops for their storylines but other
times as key ingredients in their plots’ unfolding. This chapter, firstly, summarizes
some of these novels in the hopes that local readers might be inspired to seek them
out and read what others are writing about our islands and culture. Secondly, this
work analyzes some of the ways in which these novels represent CHamoru culture
and history—at times exotically and erotically. Thirdly, this project evaluates the
historical accuracy of the novels, assessing the degree to which the stories fairly and
ethically represent the actual historical events that inform their plots.

The Exotic Environment
The Greeks defined exotikos as “foreign,” this notion extending into modern times
to include characteristics or qualities “from another country” and thereby deemed
to be “mysteriously different or unusual” (Oxford, n.d.b). The central idea behind
the exotic emphasizes the non-Native and strange origins of a person, place, or
thing in order to foreground its difference or “otherness.” Descriptions of Pacific
Islands as exotic locales have become commonplace in literature, art, film, and
other forms of popular culture, so much so that we ourselves exploit this discourse
in multiple ways, most notably to bill our islands as alluring and attractive places for
prospective tourists.

Rather than as ordinary spaces for the unfolding of extraordinary historical events,
the Mariana Islands are often described in touristic, otherworldly ways, as places
foreign, different, and marvelous—indeed, as exotic. In each of the novels, written
by both CHamoru and non-Native authors, the otherness of both the CHamoru
people and culture, as well as the island landscape, is central to the story. On perhaps
the most basic level, exoticism is expressed in terms of the tropical environment,
ranging from its oppressive heat to its gentle breezes, from its sandy beaches to its
dense jungles. The novel Spirits of the Island, for example, demonstrates this prac-
tice, describing Guam as a tropical island with “warm sun and endless beaches”
(Latham, 2014, Chapter 1, para. 1), a “gentle breeze” (Chapter 1, para. 82; Chapter 1,
para. 89; Chapter 10, para. 13), “magnificent” views (Chapter 5, para. 123), “wonderful
beauty” (Chapter 1, para. 5), and pinkish-orange sunsets that make “photo[s] look
surreal” (Chapter 1, para. 5).³ Not only the sunsets, however, evoke surrealism in
this novel written by East Texas author K. Latham (2014) and dedicated to Daniel
Aflleje for “the many wonderful memories of Guam” (Dedication). The plot revolves
around a small group of teenaged CHamoru said to have been appointed by the
taotaomo'na (spirits of the ancestors) to be “Guardians,” individuals with the ability
to shapeshift into the forms of a dog, a puma, a reef shark, a large bird, and a snake in
order to “protect the people from the jungle, and the jungle from the people. … like
a go between for the living and the dead” (Chapter 15, para. 5). Perhaps attempting
to capitalize on the success of the popular Twilight book and film series that also
feature shapeshifting teens, in Latham’s Spirits of the Island the jungle becomes a
vibrant, living, and ominous space in which the ultimate exoticisms play out.

The island landscape similarly becomes an exotic backdrop in Conquered: A World
War II Erotic Historical Romance, written by CHamoru author Paula Lujan Quinene
(2016). This novel opens with the invitation to enter “the exotic world of the Pacific,
complete with coconut trees, banana doughnuts, dolphins swimming in the ocean,
and moonlight on Pago Bay” (p. 12). Quinene tells the love story of Mangilao teen-
ager Jesi (Jessica) Taimanglo and American GI Johan Landers, a member of the
USMC invasion force. The plot begins with Jesi hiding in a Pago Bay cave in the
hours before Guam’s “liberation” from wartime occupation. She then is discovered
by Japanese soldiers and on the verge of being raped when rescued by Johan, who
kills her attackers in the process. The remainder of the novel recounts her undy-
ing love and lust for Johan, manifested initially by copious servings of delectable
CHamoru dishes (some recipes of which are included at the back of the book),
interspersed with equally large doses of explicit sexual activity. Detailed and re-
peated descriptions of the coconut husking, splitting, and grating process, as well as
mouth-watering descriptions of specific food items such as breadfruit, coconut crab,
and kelaguen, effectively serve to paint an image of Guam as a place that would be
unfamiliar, indeed exotic, to its presumably non-Native readers.

Foods-as-exotic receive similar treatment in Joan Awa’s 2017 Shadows in the Water,
a novel set in Guam during the whaling era of the 1800s. Authored ostensibly as
an homage to CHamoru culture with considerable parts of the novel written in the
native language, Awa (2017) writes of “exotic dishes the ship’s crewmen have eaten—
an array of sea turtles, an endless supply of coconut, and a variety of savory fish
that only swim in the ocean of the Pacific” (Chapter 3, para. 8.). As in Conquered,
everyday CHamoru foods become exoticized as marvelous wonders. But tropical
food-as-exotic turns fictitious in some of the novels, particularly when describing
animals that are not found in the island jungles. In Some Boy, for example, author
Susie Sample (2014) erroneously states that the CHamorus survived World War II by
eating most of the monkeys on the island (Chapter 2, para. 8). In another novel, The
Ghost of Guam, Japanese straggler Shoichi Yokoi survives his 28 years in the jungles
near Talofofo by trapping wild squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits (Flannery, 2016, p.
107). Despite the factual errors in these two novels, the images of people in “Survivor:
Guam” mode play into notions of the island environment as exotic.

Native fauna as exotic recur in the novels more than simply as food sources, with
predictable references to hilitai (iguana) roaming the land, fanihi (fruit bat) on the
dinner tables, wild boars on the attack, and snakes slithering through the jungles.
Going even further, one novel resorts to creating a fictional beast. In Kent Johnson
Olsen’s (2014) Chamorro, a community of CHamorus living in an underground
“cavern city” find themselves at the mercy of vicious “guegpo” birds—flesh-eating
specimens with 18' long bodies, 30' wing spans, and jaws longer than an alligator’s
body (Chapter 6, para. 68). Killing them and then finding a way back to the “sun
world” forms the primary storyline of this self-labeled historical fiction.

In novels such as Spirits of the Island, Shadows in the Water, Some Boy, Ghost of Guam,
and Chamorro, whether in realistic or imaginary form, the Mariana Islands’ tropical
environment, foods, and animals are depicted in different ways as exotic—remarkable,
different, and unusual. The particular convergence of heat, humidity, wildlife, spir-
it-filled jungles, sunsets, and sunrises that occurs in the Marianas animates the action
within each novel. Consequently, as a result of being exoticized rather than treated
simply as the geographical backdrop for the various plotlines, the Mariana Islands’
tropical environment becomes a principal actor in these stories—indeed, a determin-
er of history. Amidst the storied struggles with giant birds (Chamorro), shapeshifting
creatures (Spirits of the Island), and jungles filled with a wide variety of both natural
and supernatural threats (Some Boy, Ghost of Guam, Shadows, Spirits), readers get the
sense that the described events could not happen in just any other place.

Such exploitation of this notion of the exotic problematically positions our foods,
fauna, flora, and weather as central features in determining our uniqueness, rather
than crediting CHamorus throughout past centuries for making intelligent and
thoughtful decisions concerning their families, villages, and islands. The result is an
environmental determinism in which the Mariana Islands’ tropical landscape be-
comes a principal actor, thereby reducing the active agency of the CHamoru people.
The islanders become mere pawns of nature, rather than the agents or makers of
their history and culture. Yet history demonstrates that the CHamorus are a people
who have successfully negotiated the changing demands of four colonial eras over
the course of more than three centuries, as well as navigated complex histories of
births and deaths, marriages and fiestas, typhoons and earthquakes, and more. It
is thus belittling to suggest that anything other than human ingenuity and perse-
verance, familial dedication and sacrifice, and personal decision-making deserves
credit for explaining the course of our cultural development. We are who we are
today because of specific people’s actions and inactions in the face of whatever chal-
lenges were present at specific moments in time, not because of our region’s heat,
sunsets, animals, and plants.

Dictionaries define the erotic as that which arouses sexual desire or sexual excite-
ment (Oxford, n.d.a), and indeed, among the novels under consideration in this
essay are two works categorized within the genre of erotica—Conquered and Tropical
Medicine. Tropical Medicine’s plot tracks a high-powered New York art designer’s busi-
ness trip to Saipan and the sexual liaisons that await her in the surrounds of the
Hyatt Hotel. This work does not merely contain tidbits of sexually explicit materi-
al; its purpose is to deliver erotic content, and the weak plot is simply the delivery
vehicle. It does, however, contain descriptions of modern Saipan and some of its
tourist attractions, lust-worthy men being among them. The second erotic fiction,
Conquered, declares itself with its subtitle, A World War II Erotic Historical Romance.
Unlike Tropical Medicine, however, Guam’s history is an important part of the sto-
ryline. Indeed, the Pacific War provides the ideal historical context to support the

plot of a heroic American soldier who rescues a CHamoru damsel in distress from
the violent clutches of evil Japanese brutes.

Quinene’s Conquered fuses the exotic with the erotic in numerous ways. Despite its
wartime context, this novel is ultimately a love story set in a romantic environment,
every breeze a sensual treat, every sunset more glorious than the one before, and
every CHamoru dish a stimulating explosion of scent and taste. In an interesting
twist on the definition of exotic as foreign, different, or unusual, Conquered exoticizes
its leading female, Jesi Taimanglo, in terms of traits that would seem not unique but
instead familiar to its readership, presumably comprised mainly of non-CHamorus
who would be unfamiliar with the local foods described in detail throughout the
book. Specifically setting Jesi apart from other local women are her oft-mentioned
green eyes (Quinene, 2016, Chapter 2, para. 51; Chapter 3, para. 7; Chapter 14, para.
25; Chapter 37, para. 17) and light-colored skin (Chapter 3, para. 109; Chapter 3, para.
113; Chapter 37, para. 17). These physical characteristics, attributed by Jesi to a “light-
skinned” ancestor from a “long, long time ago” (Chapter 3, para. 113), distinguishes
her from other CHamorus described only as “pretty dark” (Chapter 3, para. 109).
Jesi’s green eyes, plus recurring descriptions of sexual arousal triggered by the
scent of her coconut-oiled skin (Chapter 5, para. 4; Chapter 9, section 3, para. 42),
become the primary aspects of her exotic and erotic appeal to Johan. Thus, part of
Conquered’s exoticism entails a hybridity of traits both foreign and familiar; that is,
rather than treating CHamoru women in general as exotic because of their physi-
cal and cultural “otherness,” Conquered distinguishes Jesi as unique because of her
combined Native and non-Native characteristics. In Conquered, the exotic CHamoru
woman is not some dark, sensuous Islander cliché, but instead a coconut-scented
woman who might pass for white. Jesi’s hybrid characterization suggests a blended
CHamoru-Spanish lineage, whether consensual or, possibly non-consensual, de-
scribed as “rape-colored skin” by Black poet Caroline Randall Williams (2020). In
either case, Jesi’s light skin color can be read as heightened accessibility to Johan.

Erotica is not limited to those works classified within the named genre. Even in
some of the non-erotic historical fictions, only a thin line separates the exotic from
the erotic as gentle breezes, spectacular sunsets, and warm waters are often accom-
panied by sensuous and sexualized bodies. Shadows in the Water perpetrates the
stereotypical “hula dancer” sexualization of Pacific Island women with Awa (2017)
describing a group of female dancers in terms of the “swaying of hips, the clanging
of shells and the dark hair flowing with the wind” (Chapter 4, para. 1). Another
novel, however, seemingly subverts this exotic-as-erotic motif. In A Mansion on the
Moon, author Cathy Sablan Gault (2015) repeatedly refers to her protagonist Vivian
as “exotic,” yet conspicuously avoids equating that with eroticism or sexuality.
Instead, Vivian’s exoticism is defined in terms of curiosity (Chapter 18, para. 46);
resilience, strength, and physical fitness (Chapter 21, para. 17); confidence (Chapter
25, para. 25); and rarity (Chapter 45, para. 28). Despite the author’s frank exoticism
of this character, she does not treat Vivian as a sexualized object of physical desire.
In this way, Gault redefines the terms of the island exotic, emphasizing outstanding
character traits rather than physical difference.

Interestingly, the novels under review here eroticize the male body more so than the
female one. The second work of erotic fiction, Tropical Medicine by Lynda Ambrose,
describes little of the female lead character, instead focusing on the three men with
whom the lead character has sexual encounters. Ambrose (2013) exploits the “sex on
the beach” fantasy with the main character who, while on a business trip to Saipan,
imagines herself on a hidden beach, “lying under a hanging cliff, with waves breaking
and salt air, watching the sunset” while engaging in sexual activity (Chapter 4, para.
37). She describes her main interest, Gregorio, as “a shaggy-haired, barely-clothed,
chocolate-skinned fisherman … [who] smelled like salt, sweat, and Budweiser”
(Chapter 5, para. 12). Describing his skin as “the color of the gooey syrup at the bottom
of a Starbucks mocha” (Chapter 9, para. 1), Gregorio is her “tropical medicine, a close
and special friend who gave [her] something amazing” (Chapter 14, para. 6).

Similarly eroticizing its male characters, Latham’s (2014) paranormal shape-shift-
ing fiction, Spirits of the Island, describes its leading male, Michael or Miguet, as
having a “chiseled chest and sexy six-pack abs” (Chapter 2, para. 57) and his circle
of male friends as “all varying degrees of hotness” (Chapter 9, para. 176). After
meeting the cohort of teenaged males, Tori, the lead female character, asks, “Do all
island guys look buff and sexy?” (Chapter 6, para. 103, emphasis in original). Latham
extends the sexualization of CHamoru men even to their speech, with Tori com-
menting, “the light accent in his [Miguet’s] voice was enough to send a rush of heat
to my cheeks” (Chapter 1, para. 92).

In these works, the authors commingle the exotic island landscape with the erotic
sexuality of their CHamoru characters, males even more so than females. This motif
of linking the exotic and erotic should come as no surprise, however, since the global
tourism industry’s portrayal of the Pacific as a place for weddings, honeymoons,
and escapist romance is well-entrenched, particularly in Polynesia and Micronesia.
Pacific Islands, depicted in terms of their hot climate, scantily clad Natives, warm
waters, and beautiful landscapes, become ideal places in the world’s imagination for
the fusion of the exotic and the erotic.

Historical Fiction or Fictional History?
All of the novels under review could be classified as works of historical fiction, a
genre that has become increasingly popular. Historian Jerome de Groot noted in
his 2010 The Historical Novel that “the last few decades have seen an explosion in the
sales and popularity of novels set in the past” (p. 152). Yet what qualifies as histori-
cal fiction is not a simple matter. To address this issue, Eastern Illinois University
Professor Sarah Johnson (n.d.), writing on behalf of the Historical Novel Society, of-
fered a working definition of the historical novel as “a novel which is set fifty or more
years in the past, and one in which the author is writing from research rather than
personal experience” (para. 7). Other scholars define the genre more inclusively, fo-
cusing on the subject matter, rather than a historical timeline. For example, Daniel
McGarry and Harriman White, authors of the World Historical Fiction Guide, defined
historical fiction more broadly as works that include “reference to customs, condi-
tions, identifiable persons, or events in the past” (De Groot, 2010, p. 986).

By McGarry and White’s definition, each of the 11 novels under review qualify
as historical fiction, dealing with the Mariana Islands and its people and culture
at some point in the past. Four of the novels, however, situate their stories in the
present—the erotic novel Tropical Medicine, set amidst Saipan hotels, duty-free
shops, and Japanese tourists; the shapeshifting Spirits of the Land, with references
to cell phones, tablets, and BFFs; Mariana Sky by Steven Aflleje LeFever, situated
during Guam’s hosting of FestPac in 2016; and P.F. Kluge’s Master Blaster, set in
Saipan in the mid-2000s, a time marked by the closure of garment factories, the Jack
Abramoff scandal, and the launch of the now-defunct website, Saipansucks.com.
In these contemporary-era novels, the historical content and context is assumed,
rather than explained and developed. Hence, despite their references to aspects of
Marianas history and culture, their categorization as historical fiction would appear
to be generally unwarranted.

Self-categorized as historical fiction, LeFever’s (2016) Mariana Sky tells the fantasti-
cal story of an English-speaking Marianas Fruit Dove named Tsewi that travels to
each of the Mariana Islands in search of philosophical growth and spiritual enlight-
enment. Each chapter is dedicated to one of the islands as the bird flies from the
northernmost Farallon de Pajaros to southernmost Guam and conveys its impres-
sions of the landscapes and personalities encountered in the voyage. Along the way,
the bird comes into contact with CHamorus struggling to maintain their connec-
tions to the land and ocean, as well as their cultural and linguistic traditions. The
American military appears as the chief threat to the islands, ocean, and CHamoru
lifestyle. Mariana Sky is part travelogue, part armchair philosophy, and part histor-
ical and cultural critique, representing the Marianas as places of immense physical
and cultural beauty that are continually threatened by arrogant and condescending
imperialists. The author intends his story to be both a personal statement of cultural
pride and a broad cry for Pacific Islander unity. But historical reality it is not.

The last of the contemporary novels, Master Blaster, by renowned author P. F. Kluge
(2012), tells a sordid tale of corruption and exploitation in Saipan. The title refers
to an anonymous website author, “the Master Blaster,” who takes it upon himself
to expose acts of malfeasance occurring on the island. His litany of offenses lists
“Slavery, human trafficking, prostitution, gambling from cockfights to poker to casi-
nos, drugs from pot to ice to crack, corruption, nepotism, swindling, crimes against
tourists, sanctuary for Japanese and Chinese gangsters, disbarred lawyers, tax
evaders and trust fund fiddlers” (p. 185), and his website “blasts” CHamorus, both in-
dividually and collectively, for their assumed characteristics of laziness, greed, and
foolishness. As the main character (and heroic figure), who arrived in Saipan as a
Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s and never left, the Master Blaster bemoans the
loss of the island’s simpler times, before the Commonwealth Covenant.

In the novel, various Americans come and go, all attempting to fill some emptiness
in their lives and wishfully thinking that Saipan might do the trick. In the mean-
time, CHamorus lurk in the shadows as devious characters waiting for their golden
opportunity to swindle this latest batch of fresh white meat on the island. In Master

Blaster’s version of history, the Northern Marianas received the so-called gifts of
America on a silver platter, and, having done absolutely nothing to deserve this
largesse, proceeded to squander the bounty, quickly and corruptly. In the process,
the CHamorus have willfully destroyed their island and culture. Although praised
by the New York Times as “stingingly funny” (Maslin, 2012), this book serves as a rich
illustration of Māori author Patricia Grace’s admonition that “books are dangerous”
when they perpetuate negative and insensitive images of Indigenous, colonized
people (Smith, 2012). CHamorus are portrayed as uniformly unethical and unprin-
cipled, as well as lacking any semblance of self or cultural pride, with the author,
moreover, cynically implying that there is no turning back. This bleak perspective
is voiced by one of Kluge’s (2012) key CHamoru characters, “Big Ben” Romero of the
Saipan Governor’s Office, who states, “We didn’t control the past. We don’t control
the present. Or the future” (p. 299).

In addition to these four contemporary novels, two works, Chamorro and Shadows in
the Water, are set in the 1800s, and five are situated around or shortly after the Second
World War—Conquered, The Ghost of Guam, Some Boy, A Mansion on the Moon, and
Natural Destiny. These all make considerable use of historical events and contexts, yet
for the most part would more appropriately be labeled as fictional history rather than
historical fiction. In several, their free invention of historical events and wild versions
of CHamoru culture fall so far outside the bounds of reality that I would be reluctant
to grant them historical credibility. The issue of historical accuracy has been hotly de-
bated by those who seek to delineate and evaluate the field of historical fiction. Some
argue that these novels are, after all, works of fiction and do not represent themselves
as histories, even if they categorize themselves as historical fiction.

But leading scholars of the historical fiction genre disagree. The Historical Novel
Society (n.d.), for example, asks, “How much distortion of history will we allow
before a book becomes more fantasy than historical?” (Para. 1). Similarly, scholars
such as Jerome de Groot (2010) of the University of Manchester urge novelists to
embrace a “duty” to history (p. 288) and to historical accuracy, as well as to avoid
misrepresenting the past or committing anachronisms. This is particularly signif-
icant in light of a trend that has been developing since the beginning of the 20th
century to use historical novels “as something educational … and as a form which
in some ways was in dialogue with history rather than with the aesthetic strategies
of fiction” (de Groot, 2010, p. 947).

While Mariana Sky, Tropical Medicine, and Spirits of the Land steer fairly clear of
much historical commentary, both of the novels set in the 19th century, Chamorro
and Shadows in the Water, immerse themselves in it. Yet their storylines commit nu-
merous errors of fact, in addition to considerable faults of anachronism, attributing
to the 1800s aspects of CHamoru lifestyle from either pre-colonial or contemporary
times. Chamorro obviously intends to be a fantasy rather than a history, as evident
in its author’s creation of a species of gigantic birds, the “guegpo,” that threaten
CHamoru lives. The novel opens with the suggestion of cultural and historical
authenticity by citing an “old Chamorro legend,” but it then delivers an invented
tale. Rather than the traditional CHamoru creation story of Puntan and Fu'una, the
author imaginatively writes, “The Ladrone Island was created when the Sun God
placed three stone pillars in the ocean and covered them with dirt and trees and
plants and animals” (Olsen, 2014, Chapter 1, para. 1). Later portions of the novel de-
scribe 19th century CHamorus maintaining their “ancient religion” by continuing to
keep the skulls of their leaders in order to worship them as aniti (Chapter 5, para. 4),
a practice which ended in the 1600s. It also invents the cultural attire of CHamoru
chiefs, itself a position nonexistent by the 1800s, as comprised of a necklace made
with a “guegpo” bird talon (Chapter 29, para. 59) as well as “a tall headdress filled
with guegpo feathers” (Chapter 21, para. 72-73). The blurring of fact and fiction that
permeates this novel can be difficult for unfamiliar readers to discern, and indeed,
two reviewers on Amazon.com praise the author for sharing stories of their home
island, for loading the book with educational facts, and for sacrificing so that future
generations of CHamorus can learn their stories.

Shadows on the Water similarly misrepresents CHamoru culture in its exoticized
description of cultural rites and ceremonial wear, as well as in its numerous anach-
ronisms. Awa (2017) describes performance of CHamoru cultural dances and chants
by young, nubile islanders in the late 1800s, similar to the contemporary Taotao
Tåno or I Fanlalai'an troupes, while also fictionally depicting the chiefly ceremonial
dress to include “an overlay resembling a poncho made of dried coconut leaves and
a tie in the center. … [while] dried nut shells dangle from a rope bound to their
calves” (Chapter 4, para. 4). Moreover, the clans and warriors of Guam are shown to

unify in order to wage war against visiting whalers, while the Spanish priest is called
upon by the CHamorus as a respected ally to lend the services of his government’s
military in support of the warriors. The characters have names like Torahi, Pulan,
Fu'una, Isa, Inina, and Apu, again more reminiscent of 20th and 21st century naming
practices, while the central figures live in latte stone houses, almost 200 years after
their actual disuse. In much of the novel, events in history from the 1600s, 1800s, and
1900s become (con)fused within the fictionalized plot line. Despite its admirable
intent to tell a story of the beauty and strength of the CHamoru people and culture,
its misrepresentation of history undermines its credibility.

CHamoru supernatural beliefs are misrepresented in several of the novels, particu-
larly whenever the specter of the taotaomo'na, or spirits of our ancestors, emerges. In
Spirits of the Island, for example, the shapeshifting characters in the novel exist entire-
ly for the purpose of protecting ordinary CHamorus from the dangers lurking within
Guam’s jungles and waters. Similarly, Shadows in the Water represents the taotao-
mo'na as primarily malevolent and the jungle as an ominous space. For instance,
when one of the female characters, Apu, goes missing from the village for a secret
rendezvous with some American whalers, her family and friends express their con-
cern for her disappearance in terms of a taotaomo'na occurrence (Awa, 2017, Chapter
6, para. 1). Similarly, the duendes are understood as malicious and dangerous beings
that reside in threatening jungle spaces. The mythological creatures, named from
the Spanish word duende, meaning fairy, are typically described by CHamorus as
dwarflike beings who lure young children away, sometimes for extended periods of
time, and return them physically unharmed but often in a mute state.⁴ In Spirits of
the Island, author K. Latham takes fictional liberty by defining duendes as CHamoru
children who had been slaughtered by the Spanish during their conquest of the
Marianas in the 1600s. Latham (2014) writes that the existing duendes “trick living
children to follow them into the jungle, then shrink them down and keep them
there. Eventually these children become more Duendes” Chapter 18, para. 13).

Perhaps the most egregious historical inaccuracies can be read in The Ghost of Guam,
a fictional story based on the historical experiences of Shoichi Yokoi, the famous
Japanese straggler who survived for 28 years in the jungles of Talofofo. The novel
flips between World War II and modern Guam, spanning Yokoi’s wartime experi-
ences to his eventual discovery and return to Japan. Right from the start, the novel
errs with the Japanese invading Guam a year too soon, in December 1940. It also
creates a handy disclaimer by naming the main character Satoshi Yoko, rather than
Shoichi Yokoi. True-to-life descriptions of CHamoru suffering and malnutrition,
American valor, and Japanese brutality infuse the story, but are marred by flagrant-
ly false information. For example, author Flannery (2016) writes that when the
Japanese caught CHamorus hiding food, they would “cut off the victims’ heads and
put them up for display for months” (p. 37). He also erroneously claims that “It was
nothing special to see the soldiers cut open one of the CHamoru, while still alive
tear out his heart and intestines to the screams of the person” (p. 54) and, yet again,
speaking through Yoko, says, “I saw once how babies were tossed around on bayo-
nets among a group of laughing soldiers, and another time thrown against a rock,
and yet another time dumped into boiling water” (p. 57). The author also combines
the wartime suicides of Japanese civilian and military personnel on Saipan’s Suicide
Cliff and Bansai Cliff and situates them instead at Guam’s Two Lovers Point (pp. 86,
96). Flannery’s exaggeration of wartime violence ultimately undermines the truth of
the CHamoru people’s suffering.

Three other World War II novels fare better in terms of representing the day-to-day
challenges and fears faced by CHamorus who lived through the experience, al-
though serious questions of historical accuracy nonetheless arise. The novel Natural
Destiny tells Guam’s wartime history from the perspective of Sumay child, Bernidita
or Bernie, only 8 years old at the war’s onset. Novelist Sherry Dixon forewords her
novel with a powerful story about her mother, an elderly CHamoru woman who
more than 50 years after the war suddenly and shockingly opened up one day about
her wartime experiences. According to the author, over the course of several months,
her mother, the novel’s Bernidita, shared her traumatic memories. Dixon (2012) de-
scribes, “I wrote notes in a journal so I would not forget. After I had filled a couple of
journals, she said, ‘Sherry, this needs to be a book’” (p. 4). Thus was Natural Destiny
initiated, Dixon dedicating the book “to my mother and the thousands of other
Guamanians who struggled under the Japanese occupation during World War II”
(Dedication, p. 1). Despite the noble intentions, however, a number of glaring factual
errors detract from the book’s historical value.

Natural Destiny tells the perspective of Bernie, who lost both of her parents by the
time she was only 4 years old, then moved from Hagåtña to live in Sumay with her

bachelorette godmother (Nina) and her godmother’s mother “Nanan Beha [sic].”
On December 8, 1941, while the island celebrated the Feast of the Immaculate
Conception, Japan’s bombings of Guam began. From this point on, the events, dates,
and places become badly jumbled. According to Dizon’s story, most of Sumay’s resi-
dents, including her Nina and “Nanan Beha [sic],” were attending the fiesta mass in
the Sumay church when the building was bombed, killing a large part of the village’s
population and leaving Bernie essentially orphaned. The Japanese proceed to invade
two days later, forcibly marching Bernie and the other Sumay survivors to a concen-
tration camp in Manenggon where they remained for the war’s entire duration of
two and a half years (in actuality, it was 11 days). The story erroneously claims that all
the infants and toddlers, as well as the elders and those with any physical disability,
were ushered out of the camp and killed (pp. 66-69). All the unmarried females, ages
seven and up, were taken to serve as comfort women to the Japanese (p. 72), a horror
that Bernie escaped because her short buzz-cut hair enabled her to be mistaken
for a boy. Although, in actuality, some CHamoru women were forced into sexual
submission, it has never been reported on the scale described in Natural Destiny.

Indeed, historical memory can be slippery in the best of circumstances, even imme-
diately after an event has occurred, and what a child remembers and comprehends
of an event is also questionable. Nonetheless, while Natural Destiny may contain un-
derstandable errors of memory and judgement coming 50 years after the event from
someone who was a child at the time, the novel’s compounding of errors discourages
me from recommending it to anyone not already knowledgeable of Guam’s wartime
experience. Although the novel admirably captures the emotional strength, determi-
nation and cohesion of the CHamoru wartime community, its glaring factual errors
undermine its utility as a representation of Guam’s wartime history.

Another of the war novels, Conquered, similarly captures the history of CHamoru
suffering, fear, and sacrifice, although it does not offer much historical detail.
Despite being set during the war and classifying itself as historical fiction, Conquered
is ultimately a love story that uses the historical event primarily as a stage for the
meeting of its two main characters, an American Navy officer and a young CHamoru
woman. The author is more instructive in addressing CHamoru cultural attitudes
towards Americans and the military, and she makes it clear from the start where
her loyalties lie. Quinene (2016) begins her book with a dedication not only “To the
survivors of WWII on Guam,” but also “To the military families who lost loved ones
fighting for Guam during WWII; To the veterans and their families who have served
Guam and the United States of America; To the men, women, and their families
who still serve, protecting and defending Guam and the United States of America”
(Dedication). To them, Quinene states, “I thank you. We thank you.” In Conquered’s
story of the 1944 biracial courtship between Jesi Taimanglo and Johan Landers, the
author highlights notions of CHamoru gratitude to the US for its defeat of occupy-
ing Japanese forces, but not in the usual terms of CHamoru men enlisting in the
service as a form of cultural reciprocity. Instead, the Islanders’ gratitude plays out
as CHamorus’ eagerness for their daughters to marry white men. Although some
of the American characters in the novel express surprise at the interracial wedding,
Johan explains that “The locals were so grateful they didn’t have any reservations”
(Chapter 16, para. 10). This story of American valor and heroism, accompanied by
CHamoru gratitude, is a common narrative in most of Guam’s history books and
other publications concerning World War II. The accuracy of this perspective,
however, is problematic and has been questioned in recent years⁵, although it does
undoubtedly represent views held by some portion of the population.

The most ambitious of the novels, A Mansion on the Moon by Cathy Sablan Gault
(2015), is a saga across three generations of CHamoru women in the de Leon family,
beginning in 1899 with Amanda encountering the first Americans to colonize the
island. The family saga continues with Amanda’s daughter, Sylvia, who marries
Tino Flores Camacho and gradually acculturates during the early American colo-
nial era. The saga concludes with Amanda’s granddaughter, Vivian, whose romance
with a US Navy officer survives the hardships of World War II. Unlike Conquered’s
romanticized treatment of the American military presence in Guam, Mansion offers
a more even-handed approach, portraying American racist and condescending
attitudes towards CHamorus as well as the benevolence and goodwill of some of
the men stationed on the island. Gault’s storylines depict CHamoru characters as
resilient, facing major earthquakes and typhoons without fanfare or drama. After
one typhoon, for instance, one of the Navy men reflects that “the strong Chamorro
instinct for survival had developed not only out of their will to live, but also on their
recognition of nature’s foibles, their stoic acceptance of the consequences, and on
their dependence on one another” (Chapter 26, para. 10). The CHamoru response
to the war would align with this cultural pattern, the novel concluding, “Nothing in

Guam or for any of its people was ever going to be the same again. Yet the people
of Guam would triumph over it all, as they always had” (Chapter 46, para. 28). In
Mansion on the Moon, CHamorus emerge as the true heroes of the war, raising critical
questions about the American military’s postwar land-grabbing in Guam.

Exotica to Erotica: Historical Fiction or Fictional History
Although this chapter examines only a few historical novels, it highlights the need
for local readers to engage critically in the discussion and analysis of works writ-
ten about us. With the proliferation of on-demand presses and online vendors,
publishing novels has seemingly never been easier. Moreover, while locating these
historical novels, I also came across other literary publications worthy of attention,
including collections of poetry and short stories, as well as personal memoirs and
general travelogues.⁶ An explosion of children’s books has also hit the market in
recent years, some retelling cultural legends and folklore, others creating fictional
stories, and yet others sharing personal experiences. One, for example, The Boy Who
Dreamed to Be with His Parents on Saipan, a children’s book by Riza Oledan-Ramos
(2012), tells the story of a young Filipino boy whose parents left him with relatives in
Manila as an infant while they pursued job opportunities, until the family reunited
in Saipan a few years later. Although the book focuses on the emotional needs of
children caught up in migrant labor hardships, it also exoticizes Saipan as a stereo-
typical paradise, replete with “white, sandy beaches” (Chapter 7, para. 7), delicious
fruits, and pleasant weather. The genre of children’s literature, with books written
both in CHamoru and English, offers much opportunity for further analysis.

Works of historical fiction, whether accurate or inaccurate, are easily accessible as
both paperbacks and e-books to audiences around the world through global vendors
such as Amazon and Apple’s iBook store. Written by CHamorus and non-CHamorus
alike, these books contain elements of tropical exoticisms that portray the Mariana
Islands as otherworldly paradises that look, taste, and smell unlike anything found
in the Western world. Although seeming to compliment the Marianas, these descrip-
tions border on an environmental determinism that privileges nature as the agent
of history, rather than focusing on the achievements of the CHamoru people who
negotiated whatever came their way, shaping history through their decisions and
actions. This exoticist environmental determinism positions CHamorus as passive
subjects rather than active agents of their own history. Thus, one fundamental flaw
with overly exoticized emplotment is that it strips islander agency from CHamorus,
a tactic that denies us the ability to shape our own history.

Some of the exotic otherness within the novels panders to the erotic desires of their
primarily white, single, heterosexual characters—and is, in fact, based on misin-
formation. Errors also confound the exoticized novels, and perhaps this could be
remedied through a more determined effort on the part of locals to hold authors
accountable for their representations of CHamoru culture and history. The tar-
geted audience appears to be primarily non-Natives, and perhaps secondarily the
thousands of off-island CHamorus in the US mainland, readers with scant direct
knowledge of the islands and who therefore require detailed descriptions of weath-
er, landscapes, and everyday cultural practices. The romantic image of Mariana
Islanders existing in some otherworldly paradise, free from the problems of modern
civilization, might be enticing to such readers. But presenting inaccurate informa-
tion that fails to reflect the complex challenges that CHamorus have faced over time
performs a disservice to the CHamoru people, regardless of how seemingly positive
the overall portrayal.

Most of the novels under review here exhibit a pervasive and grievous inattention
to historical accuracy, and some grave cultural misrepresentation. These inaccu-
racies range from careless depictions of monkeys, giant birds, and chipmunks in
the islands’ jungles to flagrant falsehoods about the experiences of violence during
the Second World War. Breaches of creative license occur in the recitation and
explanation of CHamoru legends and cultural beliefs (especially concerning super-
natural phenomena such as taotaomo'na and duendes), and offensive descriptions
of CHamoru character and morality further impair some of the novels. Despite their
ostensibly entertaining genre as novels, these fictional works nonetheless become
damaging sources of misinformation about the Mariana Islands, as well as unwit-
ting tools that undermine the vitality and vibrancy of the CHamoru characters.

Although novelists may rely on the convenient disclaimer that their work is fictional,
thereby somehow excusing them from being accountable for factual errors, critics
and readers alike should insist that authors exercise integrity towards the people
and events of the past. Novels that fictionalize our history and culture constitute a
form of cultural exploitation by demeaning our past and our present for the writer’s

personal gains of authorship and the revenue it might generate. Such works dishon-
or the richness and complexity of the CHamoru experience and would better be
labeled “fictional history” rather than historical fiction. Surely our 4,000-year-old
culture and history deserve better.

Mamåhlao: for Indigenous Culture (Royce Camach)

Successful composition is often measured by the writer’s ability to present a unique
contribution to scholarship. In Foucault’s (1984) description of authorship, “The
coming into being of the notion of ‘author’ constitutes the privileged moment of
individualization in the history of ideas, knowledge, literature, philosophy, and the
sciences” (p. 101). To fulfill this expectation, many beginning composition students
in Guam, who may have lived their entire lives prioritizing interdependence, must
step outside of their cultural framework and instead see themselves as individuals to
complete their assignments. This is especially true for CHamorus, the Indigenous
people of Guam and the Marianas. CHamoru students entering the institution are
welcomed by first-year composition course textbooks that present claims such as,
“The positions of authority that academics are expected to hold and the kind of value
that academics place on conveying knowledge result in language and essay structures
that may be, to the outsider, mysterious or imposing” (Fontaine & Smith, 2008, p.
3). Consequently, the students believe that the dissonance they experience is just a
natural part of negotiating their assimilation into scholarship. However, there may

be more at work in Guam and the surrounding island communities; many voices that
could bring Indigenous insight into academic spaces are practicing a silence, one cul-
turally reinforced by the CHamoru value known as “mamåhlao.”

Mamåhlao has been described as “shame or embarrassment” and is seen as import-
ant because it “represents all the Chamorro ideas of what is proper and civilized
behavior” (Kasperbauer, 1996, p. 29). At least one common scenario exists in which
adherence to mamåhlao can be observed and better understood, but there are many.
It occurs at social gatherings when food or refreshments are offered to guests, and
according to principle, the intended recipients should refuse the first and even
second offering because accepting offers brazenly is viewed as “selfish, crude and
disrespectful,” and is a mark of “having no shame.” I have come to understand that
many cultures have adopted a similar perspective on accepting food. The value can
also be observed in collaborative settings like the classroom, when participants
are careful not to dominate the discourse or be perceived to “know-it-all” (have no
shame) because these are marked characteristics of a taimamåhlao (not mamåhlao)
attitude. A student may have to be called on a few times before offering an opinion.
In other words, the student “who ‘has shame’ (mamåhlao) is always humble and
respectful [whether inside or outside the classroom]; he or she is honorable and
generous and caring of others” and will often put the group experience before any
urge to express their thoughts (p. 29). For those observing the tenets of mamåhlao, it
is more important to be seen as humble than to get “ahead,” even at the cost of going
without food so that others can get their fill, or conceding in an argument even if the
other party is incorrect.

If this is the case—that the expectations of adhering to mamåhlao somehow re-
presses the fire of the Indigenous perspective, the CHamoru perspective—what is
the effect of encouraging students in the Marianas to draw on their experiences
and insights to contribute something valuable to Western academic discourse? As a
teacher in the Pacific, I often wonder what I am really asking of my students.

In Plato’s (2001) Phaedrus, Socrates relates the story of Theuth, the Egyptian god and
inventor of letters, who is challenged by King Thalus after boasting of writing’s un-
paralleled utility. To Theuth’s claim, King Thalus responds:
                              Mamåhlao
    Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability
    to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;
    and now you, who are the father of letter, have been led by your affection to
    ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this
    invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it,
    because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced
    by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use
    of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory,
    but of reminding. (p. 165)

There is a prevailing belief in many institutions that standard English and effec-
tive composition are one and the same. And this makes many weary of articulating
knowledge that is held as intimate when the primary measure of student ability and
intelligence is an adherence to proper grammar, organization, tense consistency,
and other academic conventions. Like Theuth, there are proponents of writing who
will encourage the student to mine Indigenous knowledge in order confirm or chal-
lenge some aspect of Western academic discourse. Many soon realize that, although
scholarship is valuable in academia, writing about the precepts of mamåhlao does
not refine mamåhlao culturing or prioritize Indigenous thought in the classroom.
In other words, it is difficult to serve the institution and your people. A worry is that
as CHamorus begin to see themselves as part of the academic tradition instead of
outside of it, they will refer to the literature (or the internet) to guide their behav-
ior before searching the contents of their soul, before seeking the wisdom of their
elders, before realizing that government policy and federal legislation (written word)
continue to twist their people into colonial submission.

An uncle of mine passed recently, and 9 days of rosary followed before the funeral.
The rosaries took place outside the residence under five-or-six large canopies. One
canopy was designated just for tables of food. To a visitor, it may have looked more
like a celebration than a site of grieving. The rosary ended and the techa, my great-
aunt, asked everyone to stand and bless the table(s). From the living room, where the
immediate family was gathered, her voice carried outside through a small PA system.
A line formed after a couple minutes, with the kids first and the most senior in the
family close behind. The hosting family may pick at the finger food or have a cup of
soup, but they are mainly responsible for restocking the table or making room for

another pot or plate of something that has just arrived. Someone has a little notebook
in hand to quietly record the names of the families that contribute a dish. That way,
when those families host a rosary or wedding, my family can return the favor.

An elder will say, “We have to go because so-and-so came to your cousin’s birthday
and brought two trays of buchi buchi.” The written reminders in the little notebooks
help to keep this system of reciprocity intact today, but who can recall how long
this exchange has been in practice, or remember all the families that have taken
part? That record does not live in memory. However, when it was time for my Nåna,
who has been gone for 20 years now, to bring a pot of something to her mother-in-
law’s uncle’s cousin’s rosary many years ago, she did not have to keep a notebook
of reminders; the details inhabited her soul, as if mamåhlao was a featured soft-
ware in the Indigenous programming of CHamoru people. It determines how
CHamorus should allocate their attention, to whom or what they owe a reciprocal
responsibility, and it ensures interdependence. Mamåhlao is also understood as the
soul of CHamoru culturing, and described as an “attitude of deference for others”
(Cunningham, 1992, p. 92) or a “kind of intuitive measure which tells you when your
behavior is proper and decent” (Underwood, 1978, p. 17). Those that have no sense
of mamåhlao are said to have no shame (taimamåhlao) (Topping et al., 1975, p. 132).

Presenting this kind of intimate cultural knowledge here and now, in this very text
you are reading, could be considered taimamåhlao, and students in Guam confront
this risk because they are expected to situate themselves in the academic tradition
(and concomitantly appreciate the privilege of individualization). In the process they
will be required to acknowledge the ongoing academic conversation, which includes
a colonial history that has declared Indigenous futility and promulgated the identity
of the demeaning place-name “Ladrones.” These early narratives, fueled by Western
European rhetoric, have asserted notions like, “there are no pure CHamorus,” that
the “CHamoru language is dying,” that the cultural practices of today are somehow
“less authentic than pre-contact traditions,” and that CHamorus needed and contin-
ue to depend on an external (colonial) force to propel them into modernity. Because
the literature they confront contradicts their lived experience, students often opt not
to touch cultural issues in their composition and defer to others, as if there are “ex-
perts” ready to write a revisionist CHamoru history, and as if they are not themselves
practitioners of the culturing taking place in their community.
                             Mamåhlao
These colonial narratives continue to color the perception of CHamoru culturing,
allowing these notions to be reiterated in the classroom, as if race and ethnicity are
a measure of what is pure and authentic—and not constructs of our imagination.
Indigenous students could feel disadvantaged from the onset because it is difficult
to reconcile their framework of interdependence alongside expectations to be inde-
pendent scholars. Not only are they expected to distinguish themselves from others,
but they must also engage with literature that defines the CHamoru experience as
lesser. When asking students in Guam to synthesize cultural insights and present
these findings in a classroom, they are skeptical and even distrusting because they
know that Indigenous thought is often seen as a response to and result of Western
European discourse, instead of a parallel philosophy of equal value. Teachers have
a responsibility to equip students with the appropriate regional literature to contex-
tualize this historical perspective. Students who are not equipped may find it easier
to practice a conscious disassociation from academia altogether and pursue other
avenues of achievement.

With social media and the internet facilitating a culture of accessibility, there
are endless paths to explore being CHamoru. In what has been called a
cultural resurgence, there is a palpable desire to brand the next trend, lifestyle,
or accouterment, and Indigenous undertones often get wrapped up in this
commercialization. For example, sinahi, which are crescent-shaped symbols of
seasonal renewal, are sported like fashion jewelry that can be made and worn by
anyone without coveting the lunar motifs that provide their cultural significance.
Using the symbol to communicate Indigenous knowledge about timing has remained
in tandem with the reification of a culturing that suggests “we could all be chiefs
now.” Another example is the contemporary depiction of latte, which are large stone
house posts, traditionally. These artifacts have been redesigned, resized, reinvented,
and included as images on websites or in DVDs shown to the Chinese, Russian,
Japanese, Korean, and American (military) markets. These visitors, expecting to
meet latte-makers, can instead stop at the Galleria or visit Chamorro Village, where
they can also buy sinahi and spondylus next to I ♥ Guam shirts.

Those that dwell on the misappropriation of these symbols are often seen as old-fash-
ioned or “gate-keepers,” dwelling on issues that ultimately do not matter, and may
be labeled “taimamåhlao” for their unabashed expression of distaste. Meanwhile

hotel chains and real-estate agencies, restaurants and the fitness industry, tour agen-
cies and all manner of businesses use Indigenous artifacts to advertise their services
without a responsibility to serve and enrich Guam’s Indigenous population, to which
these entities owe their marketability, at least in part. Maybe special consideration
should be extended to those whose life-long goal is to represent CHamoru-ness
judiciously so that the symbols that communicate Indigenous knowledge are not re-
duced to commercial products used to sell visitors a more exotic experience. While
some maintain that participants in our local community should value mamåhlao
attitudes, others see the distribution of cultural merchandise as a natural way of
negotiating space for CHamoru-ness in the modern era.

Epitomizing Freud’s narcissism of small differences, business entrepreneurs who
redesign cultural products for commercial distribution will be criticized for exploit-
ing Indigenous culture and other professionals condemned for putting on their
island-print shirts and “selling out.” Many toil away, endlessly debating the most
appropriate way to represent CHamoru-ness, while pressing issues like decoloniz-
ing consciousness and self-determination are passed over—a result of Guam being
inculcated by a history designed to haunt CHamorus into social disorder. Whether
in the academic tradition or on the open market, Indigenous participation is often
perceived to require a departure from Indigeneity—that CHamoru-ness must be
presented in a certain way to be marketable today. More haunting than a colonial
history is the reality that many CHamorus are not applying themselves because of a
sensed systemic disassociation between their language and cultural community on
one hand, and academia and capitalism on the other. An average of one self-inflict-
ed death per week occurs in Guam (Cruz, 2017), with systemic disassociation likely a
contributing factor. Teachers and educators, business entrepreneurs, politicians, en-
tertainers, and others all have a responsibility to guard the mental health of Guam’s
people by creating space for Indigenous success.

Just before the funeral service for my uncle at the Immaculate Heart of Mary
Catholic Church in Toto, a site of worship and grieving for generations of my family,
my great-aunt led the rosary. During one of the Lord’s Prayers, she struggled to get
the words out. One of her nieces (my aunt) knelt by her side, just in range of the
microphone. They shared rosary beads, and with cues from my great-aunt, the
prayer picked up where it left off, but this time, in English. While the shift was by
                             Mamåhlao
no means subtle, after 10 minutes a distinct cadence and style became apparent,
resembling the melodic mantra that has guided generations of CHamoru grieving.
Just like that, the voice of a new techa was recognized, validated not by an adher-
ence to an authentic language or a pure bloodline, but by an intuitive conviction
to serve interdependence. Mamåhlao culturing prioritizes interdependence. And
to the Indigenous writer, mamåhlao often means speaking through the writing
and ideas of others and only conveying a unique contribution in the absence of
a more authoritative voice. In other words, “Since decisions [are] never individual
decisions, it [is] not proper to express personal opinion directly. To do so [slows]
down the process of reaching an interdependent group consensus” (Cunningham,
1992, p. 92). Indigenous writing will benefit from an audience that is willing to read
between the lines and discern the argument being made with the same attention to
the text that we afford the greats.

The notion of “individualization in the history of ideas” is a great opportunity af-
forded to the modern writer, but the modern writer is also plagued by too much
information, and there is enough arguing in the comment sections across the in-
ternet to go around. I have begun coaching my students to select the writers they
agree with or the material they find worth consuming, and have that be a feature
in their writing, instead of instructing them to set themselves apart from an already
established perspective. Point out a scholar or business owner or politician in Guam
that has it all wrong, and be prepared to explain yourself to family members of yours
and theirs alike at the next rosary. Even if you make a solid point, you may still be
viewed as taimamåhlao for causing a stir in the first place.

Fourth Day (Gerard van Gils)

And on the third day of school, two boys rose from their desks, wildly punching
each other in the face.

I had divided my students into groups of four. They were working on their projects in
“American History” (scarcely mentioned, as my students do not often see American
history as their history). As I rounded the room, failing to keep everyone on task, I
apparently paired two boys into the same group without knowing anything of their
extensive history. So, one boy tried to cheat an answer from another, some comment
was sent back, threats were made, memories resurrected of prior offenses given and
received. And so it was that on my third day as a teacher at Kagman High School, I
calmly tried to break up a fight in my classroom. It was perhaps the most frightened
I had ever been. I almost ran out of the room to go find a real teacher.

At the time I entered my Saipan classroom, I had a certification that said I was
a “Highly Qualified” public educator. I had never stepped into a classroom or

observed a full day in school—but I was “highly qualified” because I took a test
called the Praxis and passed. My college degree is in Political Science, but I had
spent my career as a banker in Utah. When I began my career in education in the
Northern Mariana Islands, I was a stay-at-home dad and was, quite frankly, looking
for a place to fit in. I volunteered to coach a high school soccer team and enjoyed the
young people I coached. So, I started applying for open positions, of which there
were plenty, and was hired at Kagman High School. I was not likely to last. I had no
cultural understanding of my students, no professional practice or education, and I
was not well paid, working full time for less than $30,000.

What I did not realize during those first days on the job is that public education
in this country has serious illnesses, and I was merely a symptom: it is difficult to
find quality teachers and to keep them. It is even harder to hire and retain quality
teachers in remote and rural areas.

Around the country, school districts create pathways for college-educated people,
like me, to become teachers either right out of college or coming from other careers.
New teachers are essentially learning alongside their students, while often acting as
if they have all the answers. It had been 13 years since I graduated from high school,
and now, returning as the teacher, nothing had really changed: I was still looking for
answers in the back of the book.

I had crashed from teacher idealism to harsh reality in just 3 days. On my first
day, I was sure that I was answering the call to be a “hero teacher.” I had somehow
convinced myself that I was going to be exactly what these kids were waiting for. I
remember telling one girl, Talianna, that I was “the best shot she had!” I still do not
know what the hell I meant. In short, I was arrogant and had a savior complex. I was
sure that these kids needed me. I did not realize it was the other way around.

Then the third day came, forcibly reversing my worldview. My young students’ black
eyes were swelling up like water balloons on a slow fill. I dragged the boys to the office
and as we walked, I asked them, “Why were you fighting? How could you disrespect
my classroom?” They both tried to explain with phrases like, “He atan båba’d me!”
and “Pår, I never disrepeck notheen!” I could not understand anything they said, and
I told them so. Exasperated, I pleaded with them, saying, “Just help me understand!”
“Sir, no disrespect. You can’t get it because you don’t know me.”

Today, as a teacher at the same school for more than 6 years, I remember this as one
of my earliest and most powerful lessons. “You can’t teach me, because you don’t
know me.” A powerfully accurate criticism, delivered sharply to his teacher, by a
9th grade boy who had just been punched in the face. And so keenly disarmed, I
surrendered the point. “I think you’re right. I hope you’ll give me the chance to get to
know you.” The last bit was all the difference.

The remoteness and size of the islands mean that classrooms are often filled with
local kids but led by fresh and hopeful teachers who are new to the islands. Some of
these teachers are rigid, expecting island students to conform to their expectations
without investing the effort to understand the context from which their students
come. This was exactly my mistake.

At the beginning, I saw myself as the “Shining White Knight” kind of teacher, sent
to save the villagers. I have seen similar teachers arrive every August, many of whom
are like me and without previous teaching experience. While I still feel the tenden-
cies, I recognize that the desire to save the world is terribly arrogant. Even the desire
to “save one kid” is rooted in a narcissism of which I have been guilty. If you go into
the classroom with a cape on, trying to be a superhero, you will wear yourself out
and fail. Teachers must enter the classroom with an appreciation of the unknown
and learn as much as they teach. To know the young people of the islands is to love
them, and they love their teachers back. And they learn from teachers they love.

This phenomenon is acute in education, whether it’s a suburban teacher entering
an inner-city classroom or a continental teacher entering an island one. On the is-
lands, the cultural divide occurs outside education as well since many professionals
are educated elsewhere and visiting the islands on a two-year contract. A sizable
portion of the island’s doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals are from
elsewhere. They all, to some degree, suffer this disconnect. But if an engineer does
not connect with his peers on a level of cultural understanding, the generators can
still get fixed. A surgeon can take out an appendix on an Indigenous person as easily
as on an immigrant. But in education, the entire outcome seems to hinge on a teach-
er’s ability to relate to the student. That ability to relate is required. We educators

learn and adapt to the ways of these islands. The Public School System requires
teachers to take continuing education credits in CNMI history, but I think the real
burden should be on the teachers. We educators need to learn the lay of the land,
make some local friends, and internalize Indigenous culture. Acclimate to the trop-
ics in ways beyond the climate. Life is a lot more comfortable when we settle in with
the people and learn more than we teach.

I am terribly afraid to fail, and sometimes that fear paralyzes me. I think to myself,
“I’d rather not try at it—I’ll probably suck.” My fear of failure is something I work
on, and luckily teaching has provided me ample practice. Being a teacher is a ter-
ribly difficult job, and I think those who are brave enough to try it deserve honor
and respect from their communities. Teaching is a career of daily failure. It is a job
where most days, you fail to reach at least some of the kids placed before you. Even
more difficult, the students who are most in need often do not have the vocabu-
lary and emotional understanding to ask for help. So, on any good day, a wonderful
teacher will miss opportunities to love and teach. That burden weighs on educators.
Despite all the good they do, teachers stay up late at night worrying about the stu-
dents they cannot reach.

The emotional struggle of teaching is compounded for off-island educators who
struggle in a new climate, culture, and job. High school teachers everywhere are man-
aging upwards of 120–150 kids a day, of various abilities, attention spans, and smells.
Some kids smell so bad that your eyes water, but teachers love those smelly kids any-
ways. Everything is hard for teachers. They are broke and mosquito-bitten. They need
friends and support or we’ll lose them at the conclusion of their two-year contracts.
The Northern Mariana Islands have lost too many wonderful and worn-out teachers.

My help came from new friends. I became friends with a younger guy, a high school
dropout as it turns out. My attempts to help him “improve” his life were unwelcome,
and so I was not sure what I was supposed to do “for” him. DJ told me we could just
“chill,” and so we did. Soon afterwards I visited his farm, attended a baby shower,
and witnessed my first cockfight—all on the same first visit. I saw a pregnant mother
open Goodnight Moon, and then I saw one rooster murder another rooster. I lost $20
betting on the red.

Another friend, Peter, invited me to a poker game at his house. Peter is the art teach-
er at Kagman High School, and he is a master educator. I said to Peter, “I’m nervous
to go to your poker game where I’m the only non-local. I’m not sure how to behave,
got any advice?” He was a good friend and cultural guide. His advice for making
local friends at the poker table was simple: “lose.” And I did, and I kept going back,
and I kept losing money and making friends. Humbling to say, it turns out I was
never losing on purpose. I’m terrible at poker, but I have a lot of friends who will
welcome me to their tables.

Auntie Josie, a matronly Carolinian, took me in like a nephew and told me I was
family. She wove birds out of coconut leaves for my daughters and taught me to make
a mwáár. Her boys tried to teach me to mass. She told me about Pågan, where she was
born, and how she hopes to go back and teach there some day. Teachers like her build
communities, whole islands even.

My early semesters teaching were busy and filled with learning. I grew into this
place. I released some of my closely held surety and asked more questions. I listened,
and I learned. I relaxed and had fun, too. Soon, my students were laughing with
me. Disciplinary issues were gone. A class spontaneously applauded me when one
naughty boy showed attitude, and I snapped back, “ … wettz?” which is a Northside
Saipan slang word roughly expressing disbelief and shock.

There were still days, like the third day, when I came home feeling like I had just
carefully managed a brush fire. But there were more good days to add balance.
There was progress in my students, and we were all happier. Students were hanging
out in my room even when I wanted them to leave. I would see them around town,
and they would come to hug me in the stores. The community had always wanted to
welcome me, but I needed to get to know them first. I had to do my part.

In education, the good days get you through the difficult days. Sometimes, the good
days and the difficult days are one and the same. Once, when I was feeling really
low and was noticeably alone in a large crowd, a woman grabbed my hand and said,
“Mr. G? I am Victor’s mom.” She hugged me, and we were both instantly crying,
while everyone around us found a reason to look away. Victor is a brilliant young
man with special needs. Victor treated his teachers to a steady flow of mathematical

brilliance that was fractured by social difficulty. He would often storm out of class,
fists clenched, and usually it was for something I had done. I had triggered him and
Boom! —we were on a screaming outburst. Over Christmas break, we worked on
a scholarship application for about three weeks straight. Victor wrote a beautiful
essay about how he did not want to be a leader, and about how his puzzled brain
made him see the world differently and how that made his education a worthy in-
vestment. Victor won a Gates Millennium Scholarship. When I met his mother for
the first time, she knew what Victor had put me through, and I knew some of what
she had endured raising him. We were both filled with overwhelming gratitude
for the struggles and the successes. Victor is amazing and kind, and I got to be his
teacher. It was one example of many explaining why teaching is the best job in the
world, and why teachers should stick with it. I scarcely remember the hard days with
Victor. I remember Victor, with his backpack stuffed, walking up the ramp at the
airport, flying to Eastern Oregon University on a full ride.

For 500 years, these islands have had a stream of people come ashore with plans for
what they would make of the people and the place; I brought plans with me when
I came as well. What I fortunately learned is to reverse the order. I invited these
people and this place to change me, make something of me, and I learned to teach.

I recently spoke, again, with my student, Talianna. She had witnessed my early
days teaching, when I acted as the noble “first-day teacher-hero.” Talianna was
now one of my Million Dollar Scholars, Kagman High School students who were
preparing as cohorts to attend college. I asked Talianna if she remembered my first
day. She did not let me even finish the question, “Yes! Oh my God, Mr. G, you were
the weirdest! You came in talking like you were going to rescue us from all the
terrible things or something. You sounded … like … a crazy person.” She was right,
but it still hurt to remember. Then she continued, “But you weren’t weird for too
long. You got better, I think, as you got to know us.”

I dedicate these words, from my heart, to the noble educators of these islands who come back
on the fourth day and every day.

The Halo Halo (“Mix Mix”) Generation (Tabitha Caser Espina)

I am called “Balikbayan” because the girl in me is a country of rope hammocks and wal-
ing-waling orchids—a land with irresistible gravity because, in it, I forget the world’s
magnificent indifference. In this country, my grandmother’s birthland, even the dead are
never cold and I become a child at ease with trawling through rooms in the dark.
                                                        -“Corolla” by Eileen Tabios (2000),
            Babaylan: An Anthology of Filipina and Filipina American Writers, xxi.⁷

Translated literally, halo halo means “mix mix” in the Filipino language. In preparing
the halo halo dessert, an assortment of native ingredients, such as jackfruit (langka),
saba bananas, sweet potatoes (kamote), red mung beans, young coconut (buko), fla-
vored gelatin, and the quintessential purple yam (halayang ube) are mixed together,
typically in a clear glass. These ingredients are added and apportioned according
to taste. Shaved ice is piled on top before evaporated milk is poured over all the
ingredients. As all the ingredients are mixed, they are subsumed and sublated into

the dominant, white milk mixture. In halo halo, although each item maintains its
distinctive flavor, the overall taste experience is the result of the blending of flavors.

As in the Filipino halo halo dessert, there is both a distinctiveness and a mixing
that occur in the identity negotiations of immigrant third-generation Filipinos.
Third-generation youth in America find themselves situated, as sociologist Peggy
Levitt (2009) argues, between a variety of different and often competing gener-
ational, ideological, and moral reference points, including those of their parents,
their grandparents, and their own real and imagined perspectives about their
multiple identities and their homelands. Filipinos comprise a significant part
of the population worldwide, within the United States, the Mariana Islands, and
Guam. An estimated 2.2 million Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) were employed
overseas in 2016 (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2017). Filipinos now comprise the
second-largest immigrant group and second-largest Asian American group in the
United States, according to Yen Le Espiritu’s (2003) chronicle of Filipino lives across
cultures, communities, and countries. Filipinos comprised the single largest ethnic
group employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in
2005 (CNMI Department of Commerce/Central Statistics Division, 2008). In Guam,
Filipinos are the second-largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 26.3% of the
island’s population (Central Intelligence Agency, 2017). The Filipino population in
Guam has grown steadily from post-World War II to today, from approximately 7,258
in 1950 to approximately 42,057 in 2012 (US Census Bureau, 2017; Central Intelligence
Agency, 2017). As Filipino immigrants have made their homes all over the world,
their descendants continue to reconcile conceptions of home and belonging.

This chapter explores the enunciations of identity of third-generation Filipinos in
Guam, whom I term the Halo Halo generation, through my own narratives of au-
toethnography and through poems by two prolific local slam poets: Verna Zafra,
whose work interrogates Western conceptions of feminism and laments the loss of
her culture; and John “Metaforce” Sarmiento, whose work uses Filipino characters
to capture the attitudes of the young, contemporary generation. Halo halo, “mix
mix,” then, is an apt metaphor for the “mixing” that occurs in the identity enuncia-
tions of third-generation Filipinos in Guam.

Inspired by Filipina poet Eileen Tabios (2000) in her poem “Corolla,” I will be “col-
laging” the works of my peers to contextualize and frame my own narratives. This
collage strategy references not only the identities of contemporaries but also the ex-
periences of previous generations to ground elusive identities. Young Filipinos can
rewrite the words of their parents and grandparents to create a collage of collective
experience that may help them better understand their position as members of the
Filipino community in Guam.

By using the literary expressions of young Filipinos, I emphasize the significance
of our personal experiences in exploring the attitudes and ideas of this large popu-
lation in Guam. Narrative, according to narrative theorist David Herman (2009), is
“a basic human strategy for coming to terms with time, process, and change,” and
interpreting such expressions from where they emerge is essential to understanding
the thoughts, ideas, and attitudes of this contemporary generation (Introduction,
para. 2). I incorporate these theories into the halo halo theoretical metaphor I have
devised, as Wai-Chee Dimock (1991) suggests in her study of feminist new histori-
cism, to describe the complexities of life as a coherent system to be organized and
interpreted into some semblance of clarity and order. Using the halo halo dessert as
a scholarly term, as opposed to standard Western terminology, signifies progression
and hybridity, according to feminist cultural theorist Gloria Anzaldúa (2001), and
enables Filipino Americans to provide name and shape to this concept as our own.

In the Halo Halo generation, a variety of Filipino and Guamanian cultural elements
is chosen from and added together according to “taste.” While I recognize that
the term “Guamanian” is fraught with identity politics and has been criticized for
contributing to the erasure of Guam’s Indigenous people, I use this term primarily
for consistency and familiarity, referring to Filipinos’ colonial settler position on
Guam. I want to portray how these distinct cultural experiences are then mixed
with, subsumed, and sublimated into the dominant American culture through
complex processes that include acculturation and assimilation. This “mixing” is
attributed to a multitude of processes, which often diminish cultural distinctions
by varied degrees. I argue that the Halo Halo generation acts within the spectrum
of acculturation and assimilation, often altering the Filipino values of parents and
grandparents and privileging American values over both Filipino and Guamanian
cultures. This combination occurs against a backdrop of Westernization, one legacy

of which is the colonial mentality that either values or devalues, favors or rejects
various characteristics. Just as the local ingredients are often mashed into and inun-
dated in milk to become an opaque, milky mixture, American values and cultural
norms flood Filipino values and cultural norms, coloring and flavoring them. Under
the influence of the “white milk” of Westernization, the identity of the third-gener-
ation Filipinos becomes more homogenized as compared to previous generations,
assimilating Filipino, as well as Guamanian, cultural distinctions into a pervasive
American culture. I am optimistic, however, that the halo halo dessert’s inclusion
of the halayang ube ingredient symbolizes the “roots” of Filipino culture as an es-
sential ingredient of Halo Halo identity.⁸ At the same time, the Guamanian identity,
symbolized by the presence of the buko, or young coconut, in the halo halo dessert,
adds a dimension of complexity to the Halo Halo identity. Though still existent, the
“root” element of the ube and the “seed” element of the buko become dissolved into
the mixture, imperceptible but nonetheless present to create a distinct flavor. Just as
halo halo is no simple shaved ice, the Halo Halo generation is more than the sum of
its cultural ingredients and experiences.

Am I Not an Island Girl?
While I, like many of my Filipino peers, grew up in Guam, my attempts to under-
stand the different cultures that comprise my identity have often left me unsatisfied
and unsettled. Like the mixture of ingredients in halo halo preparation, I am pro-
vided with a mix of cultures and contexts, from which I choose to suit my changing
tastes. Interestingly, however, the result has been the sharp, sometimes bitter taste
of disillusionment and ambivalence, instead of a mixing of “flavors” that might pro-
duce a unique and enjoyable blend.⁹

I am a third-generation Filipina. At the age of four, I became Guam’s youngest
recording artist, singing with my mother, Alpha Espina (1994), on her Christmas
album, Back to You. At seven-years-old, I then released a solo album (Figure 1), Tabitha
Espina: Island Girl (1997), in which the title track contained words in CHamoru,
Guam’s native language.�� Throughout my childhood, I regularly performed as “The
Island Girl” at malls, local fiestas, charity fundraisers, and community and govern-
ment-sponsored events, even being sponsored by Fox Network in Saipan to perform
in my own concert. Although I enjoyed performing, throughout primary school, I
was constantly teased, “You’re not an island girl! You’re Filipina!”
Figure 1 Tabitha Espina: Island Girl Album Cover

Until then, I had not realized that I was not an “authentic island girl.” I was born
and raised in Guam and had only thought of the Philippines as a place where my
family vacationed. Though I had claimed Guam as my home, claiming to be one
of its “island girls” was crossing a line—an invisible border that delineated where I
did not and could not belong. By internalizing this putative border, I had allowed it
to cause me to doubt my own definition. I felt like Hélène Cixous’s (1993) uncertain
border crosser, “who trembles while crossing a border [and thus] casts doubt on
[her] own definition … What ‘nature’ [am I]? What ‘species’ [am I]?” (p. 131). Once
conscious of these borders, I could not navigate between cultures as seamlessly as
I had once done. From then on, I had to question what I was allowed to say or do
because I am Filipina.

This research admittedly began as an exploration of my own identity. I employ the
use of personal experience in my autoethnographic study of identity as a method
to demonstrate some aspects of third-generation Filipina identity that have only
begun to be theorized. An autoethnographic approach, like that used by Peruvemba
S. Jaya (2011), can act as a catalyst for reflection on issues surrounding diaspora and
the meanings of identity within the context of globalization. The inclusion of my
personal experience in this research is therefore part of a reflexive process, wherein
I influence and am influenced by my findings.¹¹

Espiritu (2003), in her chronicle of Filipino American lives across cultures, commu-
nities, and countries, describes how political and cultural mechanisms designed
to restrict membership are created everywhere within a nation, setting clear but
imaginary boundaries between who is “inside” and who is “outside.” The third
generation, then, lives in a mixed, “halo halo” world, and it is the divisions of this
world that engenders their Halo Halo identity. Espiritu (2003) finds, however, that
although Filipinos are discursively produced as foreign and are pressured to carry
figurative borders around with them, their self-made multiple subject positions and
transnational connections repeatedly push against these borders, as I found myself
doing. Because of these persistent borders and the push against them, Filipinos
of the Halo Halo generation lead a double or multiple existence—they have inte-
grated into Guam society as generational colonial settlers, but the original sense of
foreignness experienced by their immigrant ancestors continues to pervade their
experience. They feel that Guam is their home but may not feel fully at home. They
recognize that they are ethnically Filipino but sometimes feel shame in their heri-
tage, are reluctant to claim certain aspects of Filipino culture, and may also feel out
of place in the Filipino community.

These feelings of being unfamiliar and ill-equipped are captured in Verna Zafra’s
(2015) poem, “Tools,” published in As Us: A Space for the Women of the World. Zafra
is a young Filipina poet raised in Guam who uses written and slam poetry to ex-
plore themes of negotiation and empowerment. The emphasis of her engagement in
poetry is service, as she served as a mentor and the Program Director of Sinangån-ta
Youth Movement, Guam’s official youth slam and spoken word organization until
2015. With an ear towards the youth, Zafra (2015) describes her experience of visiting
relatives in the Philippines:

We crossed into mountain-backed fields
It was my first time;
Theirs, they had lost count.
Like hardened soldiers,
They trudged the paths
Of sword grass,
Retracing the steps of their mothers
And brothers and fathers –
The vague ghosts of my bloodline.
And with graceful dexterity,
They put their tools to use.
Tools that tilled and weeded,
Tended and sowed,
Indifferent to the black mud,
Even to their own calloused abuse.

Zafra’s poem shows her passage through rugged terrain, which is new for her but
part of the everyday lives of her relatives. The beginning of her poem contrasts their
lifestyles, with her relatives marked by generations of “hardened” trudging. Zafra
admires their commitment to the traditions of their ancestors, while plaintively de-
scribing her ghostly tenuousness. Using the metaphor of “tools,” she compares their
skill, ease, and capability, with her inability and reluctance. Zafra’s observation is,
overall, marked by shame in her different lifestyle, lack of skills, and fragile connec-
tion to her cultural heritage.

Like Zafra, the slam poetry of John Norman “Metaforce” Sarmiento confronts the
issue of belonging among youth. Sarmiento has been widely affiliated with the Halo
Halo generation. In 2015, he represented Guam in Paris, France, as he was chosen
by the Global Call for Climate Action group to perform his poetry at the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sarmiento’s dynamic poetry
articulates his fascination with his Filipino-American-Guamanian culture but also
his tensions with it.

Sarmiento’s unpublished poem, “Blind Tongue,” voices the Halo Halo generation’s
battle with boundaries set up by definitions of the authentic and inauthentic.
Because young Filipinos are classified by the first and second generations of immi-
grants as neither “this” nor “that” after all of the “mixing” of being caught between
cultures, there is a sense of being caught between identities:

You were born in a white room
beneath white lights
wrapped in a white blanket,
but raised in the grey area

of being from here
but not really from here.
..........................
‘cause your eyes
don’t speak enough Tagalog.
Your tongue is blind
to what it can’t understand.
Taste test your Filipino culture on China.
Refuse it ‘cause the flavor isn’t English enough.
..........................
You’re not Filipino
or CHamoru enough
to be from anywhere.
This is not your island.
It belongs to the activists.
They just let you live here.
You have no right to contribute to the island’s destiny.
You are one in a thousand products of immigration
stuck in this CHamoru class.
You are Filipino-American.

Sarmiento describes his birth as shrouded in a sterile, ominous whiteness that
houses him, enlightens him, and encases him. He recognizes that he is born into
a position surrounded by the “whiteness” of American Western culture, which is
common for Filipino Americans born in the United States and oriented towards
American norms and values. For Sarmiento, the “grey area of being from here but
not really from here” is a combination of white and dark, as he is born into the
“white” of the United States in Guam but is still affected by the “dark” unknown of
his Filipino ancestry. It is because of this “grey area” that Sarmiento feels his tongue
is “blind”—both his language and tastes are not Filipino and he blindly rejects what
is not “English enough.” Restricted by feelings of insufficiency, he grieves not being
enough of a Filipino or CHamoru (i.e., one of Guam’s Indigenous people), making
him unable to fully inhabit or contribute to Guam’s community, or any community.
He expresses feelings of not belonging, having no claim to the island as his home,
and having no rights. He condemns himself for being just another product of
immigration, lacking originality and significance, and being “stuck” in a culture that
is not his own. These distressing emotions encapsulate the position of Sarmiento
and others of the Halo Halo generation. Caught in the act of trying to cross a
guarded border, they are left stranded with feelings of insufficiency, inauthenticity,
estrangement, and inadequacy.

Borders create anxiety. In The Filipino Americans (The New Americans), Barbara M.
Posadas (1999) remarks that cohesion and fragmentation simultaneously character-
ize young Filipino Americans. Considering their transnational struggles, Diane L.
Wolf (2002) finds that the distress of Filipino youth, particularly females, is great-
er than that experienced by other groups and must be further explored through
individual circumstances and contextualized within historical, political, and ra-
cialized relations. Nadal (2011) describes Filipino youth’s struggles as “acculturative
stress,” due to the conflicting processes of negotiating between the boundaries of
acculturation and assimilation (p.53). Sarmiento’s metaphoric “blind tongue” is
representative of the second stage of Nadal’s (2004) Pilipino Identity Development
Model, “Assimilation to Dominant Culture,” in which Filipino Americans realize
they are different from dominant cultural norms and may attempt to assimilate into
the dominant culture and reject being Filipino. While the majority of young Filipino
Americans may appear apathetic and uninterested in understanding their complex
identities, beginning to acknowledge and interrogate this apathy signifies the be-
ginnings of a shift in ideology. While apathy is revealed in my narrative through my
self-defeating creation of restrictive borders, in Zafra’s disillusioned conclusion, as
well as in Sarmiento’s conceding that the island can never be his home because of
his felt inadequacies, the mere speaking out and pronouncement of these feelings
is the opposite of apathy and disinterest. While they speak of a sentiment that sug-
gests passivity, these narratives simultaneously and proactively contemplate these
emotions, instead displaying agency and assertion.

“Aiy, No Me?”: Resisting Anomie
Confronted with feelings of alienation and inauthenticity within their American
and Guamanian contexts, the Halo Halo generation may attempt to break down
barriers or boundaries to help ground their sense of identity. Linda A. Revilla (1997)
argues in “Filipino American Identity: Transcending the Crisis,” that part of the
“identity crisis” of youth in the Filipino American community is reconciling issues of

self-love and self-respect as Filipinos. In “On Both Sides of The Hyphen: Exploring
the Filipino-American Identity,” Ma. Teresa G. Tuason et al. (2007) write that it is
not that US-born Filipino Americans devalue Filipino customs and traditions, but
rather they grew up mostly deprived of and unfamiliar with their Filipino heritage.
However, while the work of Tuason et al. considers only Filipinos born in the US
mainland, an unfamiliarity with Filipino customs can be found in the narratives
of the Halo Halo generation who grew up and came into adulthood in Guam. Wolf
(2002) describes young Filipino Americans’ ethnic affiliation as a “largely symbolic
sense of ethnicity,” in which Filipino language, culture, and traditions are derived
from experiences that are intermittent, brief, and disconnected from the rest of
their lives (p. 263). The narratives of the Halo Halo generation reflect what Wolf
(2002) describes as an “allegiance to an imagined past” (p. 263). While the Halo Halo
generation identifies as Filipino, they also must contemplate what it means to be
a Filipino in Guam.

In my own personal attempt to actively seek out my Filipino heritage, I entered a
Filipino pageant sponsored by a local United Filipino Students Association. While
other contestants answered the questions in “Taglish” (code-switching between
Tagalog and English), I was ashamed that I could only respond in English and even
sheepishly appealed to the host for a translation whenever he spoke in Tagalog. As
other contestants incorporated Filipino dances and songs into their performances,
I sang and danced to a song in English and spoke only the one Tagalog phrase of
“Hindi kita malilimutan”—ironically translated, “I will never forget you.” I was,
much to my surprise, given the title crown of Miss Teen Philippines-Guam 2006 and
then as title-holder, I participated in various Filipino cultural events and spoke on
Filipino television and talk shows. Each experience made me uncomfortably aware
that I was pretending to celebrate a Filipino culture and history that remained largely
unknown to me. I felt unfit to represent Guam’s Filipino community, to which I had
never truly felt I belonged. I wondered, “Does being Filipina make me any less con-
nected to Guam? Does being from Guam make me any less of a Filipina? Does being
an American enrich or hinder my understanding of my Filipino culture, as it is ex-
pressed in Guam?” Once again, I felt inauthentic and questioned the symbolism of the
hyphen in my Miss Teen Philippines-Guam title: the hyphen between “Philippines”
and “Guam” was the border I inhabited. Like the hyphen, I felt nested—constricted
even—between the two communities, two cultures. Like Espiritu’s (2003) invisible
borders, that hyphen attempted to define who I was and who I was not, to what extent
I was from the Philippines and to what extent from Guam. This hyphenated identity
meant, to me, that I was neither fully one nor the other.

My experience in the pageant was somewhat detached, as I was able to appreciate
the culture and participate in the festivities only to a certain extent because they
were not a regular part of my daily life. Although I prefaced my performance pro-
claiming, “I will never forget you,” truthfully, I could not forget a Filipino culture
that I never actually knew or remembered in the first place. This avowal instead
attested to a longing and a desire to remember what had yet to be known.

It also attested to a more subtle crisis—the tension between love and respect of
the self and shame and rejection, as Revilla (1997) argues in “Filipino American
Identity: Transcending the Crisis.” This complex crisis results not from a devaluing
of whatever is Filipino but from a deprivation that then imagines Filipino as alien,
as something outside of the self (Revilla, 1997). There is thus a divide in identity, as
pride in one’s culture is intermingled with shame in not knowing it enough.

In her unpublished poem, “Moving Mountains,” Zafra also examines her tension
between self-respect and shame. She begins by challenging the impositions of soci-
ety that attempt to dictate her behavior:

Growing up,
I was told that the only way
To survive in this world
As a woman
Is not to show weakness:
I was told to always keep my head high,
My voice loud,
And my skin tough,
Because anything that looked less than strength
Instantly made me a liability,
A burden to myself

But I have walked through 23 years
With my head bowed,
Not because I am ashamed,
But because I have learned
That I cannot show respect
By having my chin up in the air,
But lowered in a sign of regard
For others and their struggles
That I’ll never know about

Zafra begins by criticizing what she has been told. She interrogates these gender
roles imposed by Western culture, and she explains in the rest of her poem that
these expectations are incongruous with her own expressions of womanhood. She
feels the need to justify her behavior, claiming that her seeming timidity is not for
lack of strength, but because of it. Her perceived timidity is instead a regard for what
she claims she will “never know about.”

Sarmiento’s unpublished poem “Jewelry” is more indignant in describing the
dilemma of the Halo Halo generation, as well as their lack of knowledge of
their Filipino culture:

[B]ut they don’t see the dilemma that they’ve put me in.
I’m in a push and a pull between my cultural identity.
My mom always said that I was born and raised on Guam,
but I’m really from the Philippines.
I guess that means I’m supposed to be
part FOB
and part almost-chaud.
...
I was born full Filipino,
but now I’m half American Colonized.
I can’t be proud of my heritage!
I know virtually nothing about the first half of it!
and the second half?!
I know so much about that sometimes I’m ashamed of it.
I know exactly what it means to be American Colonized.

Sarmiento accuses colonialism of building the borders that divide him into many
parts. While he is expected to be a “FOB,” a “Fresh Off the Boat,” newly immigrated
Filipino, he feels he is not. Instead, he identifies as “part almost-chaud,” aligning
himself more with CHamoru culture but acknowledging that he is only “part,”
not fully, and “almost,” but not yet. Sarmiento’s nuanced use of the word “chaud”
aligns with Robert Underwood’s (2017) description in “Underwood: At the Edge of
Chamoru and English,” referencing CHamoru people suffering from language loss
and who are of a particular generation and social class. The term is often stigma-
tized and used disparagingly in Guam and the CNMI. Similarly, Sarmiento blames
his dilemma of cultural identity on the previous generation, but acknowledges that
they were unaware of the circumstances they put him in.¹²

A prominent divisive factor in Sarmiento’s poem, as well as in my narrative, is the
inability to speak the Tagalog language. Within the Filipino community of Guam,
there is a broad, rigorously guarded border between those who speak Tagalog and
those who do not. This is possibly intensified by the CHamoru language revital-
ization efforts, such as CHamoru language instruction in the Guam Department
of Education curriculum, which emphasize the importance of language for the
perpetuation of culture. Many young Filipino Americans regret that they were
not taught to speak or understand any Philippine language and surmise that they
may have been able to better identify with their Filipino culture and community
if they had been taught their Philippine language, according to Jennifer G. Osalbo
(2011) in her research on Filipino American identity development and its relation
to heritage language loss. Especially with regards to teaching the Philippine lan-
guage, previous generations were often reluctant to pass on Filipino culture and
values to children and grandchildren, often citing busy work schedules, fear of
discrimination, and hopes of upward social mobility through greater English profi-
ciency. The result is a new generation of Filipino Americans who are disconnected
from their language, creating the largest divide between themselves and Filipino
culture.¹³ The American colonialism that negatively impacted the previous genera-
tions unfortunately continues to affect the successful adaptation and development
of Filipinos in Guam into the succeeding generations. The Halo Halo generation

depends on the previous generations to orient them towards Filipino cultural
values and to help them establish a place for themselves within the Filipino com-
munity. There is a discernible sense of searching for that which remains unknown
to the Halo Halo generation. Though all but invisible in the mix of bright colors
in halo halo, it is still there—the roots of halayang ube—giving the halo halo the
distinctive flavor of earth, of grounding.

“White” Milk and Young “Coconut”
In Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation, Portes and Rumbaut
(2001) find that by the third generation, ethnic ties and identities have weakened
to the point of nonexistence as immigrant groups become fully integrated into the
American mainstream. By the time the grandchildren of Filipino immigrants come
of age, their severance from the homeland is complete. They have the highest com-
posite assimilation index ranking on a 100-point scale among immigrant groups in
the United States: 100 in economic assimilation, 72 in cultural assimilation, and 65
in civic assimilation, according to a comprehensive report by Jacob L. Vigdor (2008)
of the Manhattan Institute. Nevertheless, despite the whole-hearted embrace of as-
similation, a longing for what was never known remains.

In “Alone,” a song I composed¹⁴ in 2011 for “The Navigator,” a musical digital sto-
rybook for use in a multicultural classroom, I express feelings of alienation and
drifting away from origins:

How did I get here?
It’s still a ways to go.
The distance is even harder
When you’re out on your own.
The stars remain silent
And as they shine down on me,
I can’t even tell if I’m where
I’m supposed to be.
So I cry out to the sky
And ask it, “Why?”
How much more have I to go
As I drift further
Far from home?
I am sick and tired
Of being tossed and blown!
But most of all,
I can’t take
Feeling so alone.

Pondering where I am, how I got there, and how much further I have to go produces
the feelings of loss and disillusionment experienced by the Halo Halo generation
subsumed in American culture. Moreover, as the descendants of immigrants to
Guam, the Halo Halo generation can also feel alienated by their ancestry from some
other place than the island they call home. Separated from Filipino culture and
nested within another colonized culture, the “distance” of growing up and develop-
ing a sense of self is even more difficult in isolation and without a point of reference.
Displaced, ironically despite having a physical home, and disempowered, despite
standing in their new communities, the Halo Halo generation may feel “tossed
and blown,” unable to fully ground their identities or find complete belonging in
Filipino, Guamanian, or American culture.

Metaphor continues to be helpful in understanding the complexities of the Halo
Halo generation identity. In her interviews with Filipino American youth, Osalbo
(2011) finds that a common symbol for the “Americanized” Filipino is a coconut—
brown on the outside, white on the inside. This symbol is particularly applicable to
the Guam context, as it is a local fruit that is also a common ingredient in the halo
halo dessert. Filipinos on Guam are “coconuts” in a different sense. Just as the coco-
nut is also a seed, the Halo Halo generation has been planted and grown on Guam.
Like mature coconuts, members of the Halo Halo generation come to maturation
in Guam as “brown” locals, but their insides are white—inevitably marked by the
legacies of American colonialism.

In his integral text on contemporary colonial mentality, Brown Skin, White Minds:
Filipino -/ American Postcolonial Psychology, E. J. R. David (2013) vividly recounts the
moment in his adolescence that provoked questions about his ethnic and cultur-
al identity: finding “SELL-OUT! COCONUT! YOU’RE FILIPINO, ACT LIKE IT!”
written on his school locker (p. xvii).¹⁵ Such a lack of congruence between one’s

internal and external ethnic belonging could result in psychological tension over
one’s sense of self, as suggested by Lisa Kiang and David Takeuchi (2009) in their
study of Filipino Americans. Through their narratives, the Halo Halo generation
attempts to find words for this incongruence.

In “Tools,” Zafra’s (2015) recognition of her white, smooth tools in contrast
to the worn, stained tools of her relatives attests to the internalizing of her
“whitewashed” designation:

I looked on in awe
Before looking down
At my own tools:
Smooth, white,
And in that moment,
I realized,
Dumb.
They were hands that did not know.

She is in awe of the tools of her relatives that have been burnished by trials and
experience. She finds her tools inadequate, as they are uninitiated, under-uti-
lized, and essentially “dumb.” Her hands are rendered useless, unaccustomed to
the work before her.

While Zafra genuinely describes her difference from her ancestors, Sarmiento (2012)
explicitly condemns the inauthentic way many young Filipino Americans attempt
to portray themselves in his poem, “Just a Rant”:

Brown boys got pale hoes
white washed
like French toast
with milk mixed by Foremost.
........................
A bunch of island kids
pretendin’ that they ghetto
talkin’ like they gangbangers
cause they can’t talk Filipino.

Sarmiento (2012) sarcastically describes the “brown boys” preferring “white washed,”
“pale hoes,” symbolizing Filipino youth being seduced by the allure of White
American society. The “milk mixed by Foremost” is Sarmiento’s (2012) contextualiz-
ing of this claim, as Foremost Foods Guam Inc. produces and distributes commercial
fruit and dairy products to the island. The milk being “mixed” signifies that it is pro-
cessed and inorganic, suggesting that the promises and allure of White society are
similarly artificial and empty. Sarmiento later derides the tendency of Filipino youth
to pretend to be who they are not, in an attempt to compensate for not knowing or
not wanting to admit to who they are. Sarmiento confronts the superficial desire of
the Halo Halo generation to hide and denigrate their Filipino culture and regard the
norms and culture of White America as superior. Sarmiento’s poem scrutinizes colo-
nial mentality at work in his friends and peers in the Halo Halo generation.

The previous narratives display the various forms of colonial mentality (CM). David
(2013) conceptualizes CM as being “characterized by a perception of ethnic or cul-
tural inferiority that is … a specific consequence of centuries of colonization under
Spain and the US” and “involves an automatic and uncritical preference for anything
American” (p. 241).¹⁶ CM entails associating superiority, pleasantness, or desirability
with the physical characteristics (i.e. whiteness) and cultural characteristics consid-
ered American or Western (David, 2013). Based on a large national sample of Filipino
Americans, David (2012) finds that one out of three Filipino Americans has some
form of CM, resulting in lower personal self-esteem and higher depression levels.
The Halo Halo generation’s negative experiences in their ethnic identity formation
can thus be greatly attributed to the prevalence of CM.¹⁷

A colonial mentality prevails among the Halo Halo generation, despite living in a
society as culturally diverse as Guam. This attests to the lasting effects of Western co-
lonialism in the lives of Filipinos, CHamorus, and the other ethnic groups in Guam.
American and Western cultural norms continue to pervade the lives of the Halo
Halo generation and affect their emotional, social, and psychological development.
Nevertheless, with the changing socio-political landscape, Filipino Americans of
the later generations are adapting to an increasingly diverse society. The Halo Halo

generation engages in active adoptions, adaptations, and contestations of the dif-
ferent cultures they encounter and, as a result, dynamic identity enunciation and
expression take place. While being “coconuts” appears to be a general trend in the
narratives of the Halo Halo generation, young Filipinos in Guam are recognizing
their CM, are actively resisting it, and are forming coalitions with others affected by
American colonialism.

A recent example of the Halo Halo generation fighting against CM for themselves
and others is through the Filipino Revolutionary History Teach-In that took place
on July 20, 2017 at the University of Guam. The “teach-in” was one of the monthly
sessions conducted by Independent Guåhan, a taskforce that provides education
on CHamoru self-determination and advocates for Guam’s political independence.
Kristin Oberiano (2017), whose grandfather came to Guam through Camp Roxas,
explained to The Guam Daily Post that
     As Filipinos living on Guam, we need to acknowledge that the fight for CHamoru
     self-determination is a fight for the ideals of self-governance, sovereignty and
     freedom – the same principles that led to the establishment of the Philippines,
     the USA, and other independent countries around the world.
Oberiano and co-presenters Josephine Ong, Jamela Santos, and Ruzelle Almonds
are all Filipinas who consider Guam home and hope to begin dialogue with fellow
Filipinos in Guam to stand in solidarity with the CHamoru people by supporting
the CHamoru self-determination movement (Oberiano, 2017). By presenting in-
formation on Philippine revolutionary history, Philippine migration history, and
CHamoru self-determination movements, Oberiano, Ong, Santos, and Almonds
hope that for Filipinos in Guam, understanding their own history of independence
will increase the Filipino community’s support for the CHamoru self-determina-
tion movement and will encourage other communities of non-CHamorus to do the
same. In this way, the Halo Halo generation develops ethnic and cultural identities
that transcend negative self-representations.

In Guam, the members of the Halo Halo generation are developing their identi-
ties alongside the identity politics and cultural revitalization efforts of the local
CHamoru people. While the erosion of ethnic identity usually takes place in the
course of three generations, the assimilability of the third generation must be
considered within a more complex, post-civil rights context characterized by an
increasingly non-European composition, identity politics, and ethnic revivals
(Rumbaut & Portes, 2001). By coming together to understand how their identities
are affected by American colonialism in Guam and the Philippines, the Halo Halo
generation can counteract feelings of unbelonging and disconnectedness. Kiang and
Takeuchi (2009) emphasize the importance of revisioning the Filipino American self
in order to moderate the negative effects of perceived discrimination by contributing
to a sense of group belonging, social support, and connectedness. A strong ethnic
identity enables the Halo Halo generation to participate more fully in the commu-
nity. The Halo Halo generation can be equipped to redefine themselves ethnically
and culturally to enhance their confidence and gain self-worth. This can be done by
creating spaces of agency—past, present, and in-between.

The Fluidity of Halo Halo
Diasporic spaces are places, as sociologist Peggy Levitt (2009) asserts, where norms
are constantly renegotiated across borders and the lines between home and host
cultures and between the generations become blurred, making them one intercon-
nected social experience. These diasporic spaces, as Espiritu (2003) argues, are the
“space between,” a transnational space that productively articulates the tensions, ir-
resolutions, and contradictions that underscore the multiplicity of Filipino lives and
work against definitions that would fix them in one identity or place (p. 10). Living
between old and new, between homes, between cultures, and between languages,
the Halo Halo generation does not merely insert or incorporate themselves into
existing spaces; they instead transform these spaces with memories and histories to
create new ones—a “space between” (Espiritu, 2003, p. 10). When describing my own
identity, I claim to have internalized Guam’s political status as an “unincorporated
territory,” finding myself in the conflictions and contradictions that this ambiguous
status provokes, but also emboldened to push against its limitations.

Accessing the collective memory of the community, according to Leny M. Strobel’s
(1997) study of the narratives of post-1965 Filipino Americans, brings the Halo Halo
generation full circle in the process of decolonization to recover what had once
been unknown to them:
     To reclaim memory at the personal level is to engage in the process of creating
     a collective memory of a people’s history. From their memory banks, the partici-
     pants were able to connect their personal struggles to the struggles of the Filipino

     people in the Philippines, the United States, and all parts of the world … As recon-
     structed memories, these were imbued with new meanings for the present. (p. 73)
The Halo Halo generation can compensate for a lack of cultural and historical
knowledge by integrating the experiences of other Filipinos into their personal
memories and experiences. These additional experiences become extensions of un-
derstanding and allow the Halo Halo generation to formulate a productive identity
that is able to transform and adapt to increasingly globalized contexts.

Other young Filipinos of the Halo Halo generation are similarly re-membering,
collaging, and referencing the cultural knowledge of those in the two previous
generations to foreground their identity enunciations and expressions. Writing and
research has helped my peers and me come to terms with and give shape to our
experiences as descendants of our grandparents’ immigration. By gaining access to
the experiences of Filipinos in Guam throughout the generations, the Halo Halo
generation feels richer and more encompassing.

Personal memory must, however, be fortified by historical memory. Increased
awareness of Filipino culture and history enhances the identity of the Halo Halo
generation. The current state of the diasporic Filipino is a consequence of historical
facts of racism and oppression (Strobel, 1996). By reflecting on the larger political
and historical context of Filipino immigration and how it relates to the political and
historical context of Guam, the Halo Halo generation can begin the often painful
and emotional journey of rediscovering and reconstructing their ethnic and cultural
identity (Strobel, 1996), which will in turn yield acts of reclamation and activism.

In addition to this autoethnographic research, one of the ways that I have attempted
to explore ethnic identity in the diverse context of Guam and consider the voice of
other Filipinos is through writing fiction. In “Departures,” my short story included
in the Local Voices anthology for the 2016 Festival of the Pacific, I created the char-
acter Lily, who goes by “Lila,” a half-Filipino, half-CHamoru island girl. Her mixed
identity intrigues her unnamed love interest who describes her as “worldly—or
other-worldly,” (p. 108) with a “passion that never stayed too latent beneath her so-
lemnity” (p. 110). Lila’s character, however, is not simply defined by the paradoxes of
her identity. She navigates these seamlessly and displays tremendous agency, even-
tually choosing to abandon her departing love interest and stay at home, with her
family. She has a commitment to the island she calls home, but remains perceptive
of the difficulties of living there:

“It’s a microcosm of the feeling of living on Guam … I think it brings people
together when they know what they’ll be missing,” she continued, “Families on
Guam are together all the time. And sometimes we take that togetherness for
granted. But when someone leaves, you’re forced to remember all that you loved.
It just really hurts being the one here all the time.” (Espina Velasco, 2016a, p.110)
Lila is emblematic of the fluidity of the Halo Halo identity, as she makes con-
scious choices that display her devotion to her home and yet challenges cultural
expectations. She is intrigued by her White military love interest and relishes the
opportunity to leave home for college, but she remains tied to her family and chooses
not to pursue a relationship that would take her away from home. She admits that she
is broken, but still necessary to the ecology of “[her] ocean” (Espina Velasco, 2016a).

However, balancing between the needs of the self and the expectations of the com-
munity is delicate. While integrating and considering the words of others, Zafra
cautions that there is the need to preserve the self. In “Moving Mountains,” Zafra
reconciles her sense of self amidst cultural expectations by claiming power in her
perceived weaknesses:

I have walked through 23 years
With the same blanket of skin
Wrapped around my body
It is not tough,
But it is mine.
It knows
That I want nothing more
Than to walk into rooms unnoticed
To sit in far corners
Where I can make my quiet observations
Not because I am afraid,
But because I have been raised to believe
That strength does not always come wrapped
In perfect packaging,

But in tiny frameworks of dark blemishes
And sneaky birthmarks.

While numerous voices have informed the development of her womanhood, Zafra
recognizes the most important voice is her own, as she makes her own identity. This
overtly displays the value of Western individualism. However, she also recognizes the
significance of the way she has been raised to overcome obstacles, alluding to the in-
fluence of her family. This displays the collectivism of the island culture. Her ability
to claim who she is despite “blemishes” and imperfections is an empowering act of
negotiation and resolve, based on her upbringing.

Re-Mixing: Conclusion
Spaces invite fluidity. Like the smooth, fluid halo halo dessert, the Halo Halo genera-
tion has a fluid positioning, which, in the words of cultural theorist Stuart Hall (1989),
is not a fixed, “once-and-for-all,” but a point of identification or suture made within the
discourses of history and culture. Within these spaces, the social identities of Filipino,
Guamanian, and American collide, and the Halo Halo generation can understand
how these cultures comprise their sense of self and how their identities and Guam’s
context mutually influence each other. This is a space of possibilities, re-mixing con-
ceptions of identity for their own particular purposes and contexts.

It is what historian Howard Zinn (1984) describes as a postmodern space of identity
that is both multidimensional and unified, both emotional and cognitive, and both
individual and social, so that being oneself as a Filipino, Guamanian, and American
is no longer a question of authenticity, but rather being true to self in context and in
relationship to these different senses of self. The Halo Halo generation can experience
belonging and self-realization by understanding who they are as third-generation
Filipinos in Guam. Zinn (1984) observes that the result of re-mixing selves is an identity
that is different from its competing parts. The Halo Halo identity is a constant process
of revising who one is in relation to other Filipinos in Guam, including those within
and outside their own families; in relation to changing circumstances, such as Guam’s
changing socio-political landscape; and in relation to different cultures, such as that of
CHamorus and other communities who call Guam home. Just as the different ingre-
dients undergo changes when mixed together in the halo halo dessert (e.g. mashing,
breaking apart, dissolving), the Halo Halo generation is simultaneously embedded in
more than one context where fluid social spaces are constantly reworked and re-mixed.

In Authentic Though Not Exotic: Essays on Filipino Identity, Fernando N. Zialcita
(2005) aptly articulates the foundation of this postmodern space: “Often people
think in terms of ‘Either … or,’ … [but] I believe it is really a case of ‘Yes … but …
’ Yes, to certain features of Westernization; no to others and at the same time going
beyond them to work out a better order” (p. 26). It is this selectivity that epitomizes
the Halo Halo generation’s perspective. Their future depends on flexibility and
shifting to divergent thinking, which, according to cultural and feminist theorist
Gloria Anzaldúa (2001), is moving away from analytical, singular Western think-
ing and instead towards a holistic perspective that breaks down paradigms and
straddles cultures. This self rejects Western polarization, is collective and encom-
passing, stands in solidarity with others, and is uniquely and distinctly its own. It
offers an invitation: “Kumain na tayo! Let’s eat!”

Poetry from a Son of the Marianas (Craig Santos Perez)

During Your Lifetime, 2016
for Guam’s “Greatest Generation,” which refers to the generation of native CHamorus who
died and survived the massacre of World War II in Guam, including my grandma, who
passed away in 2018, at the age of 95
         ~

You survived violent Japanese military
occupation and the bloody march
to Manenggon. You endured American

bombing, and felt the wounds of our island
stitched by barbed wire fences. You said
goodbye to the sons and daughters of Guam

as they donned uniforms and deployed

overseas. You hugged all your children
as they migrated, one by one, off-island.

You witnessed invasive beetles devour
half our coconut trees. You prayed
as diabetes and cancer diseased half

our relatives. You listened as English
endangered our language and snakes
silenced our birds. Dear grandparents,

I doubt if we’ll ever receive reparations,
or sovereignty over our own nation. I
can’t count how many more body

bags will arrive with tough boxes and
folded flags. I’m not sure if our language
and birds will sing wild once again

beneath healthy coconut trees. And I
don’t know if all your children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren,

will return home, together, during
your lifetime, to show the abundance
that you will be survived by.
Ode and Elegy to Drinking a Can of Coconut Water with My Dad in California

Once, I bought a can of coconut water for my dad
because he felt homesick for the island of our birth.

After the first taste, he can’t stop talking story
about the tropical past. He claims, as a barefoot

child, he climbed tall coconut trees that touched
the Western Pacific sky. And he swears his grandpa

removed the husk with his teeth and cracked the shell
with his knuckles. And he swears his grandma grated

the meat with her fingernails, and squeezed it into milk
and oil. These products are trendy and expensive now,

I tell him, imported from plantations in Sri Lanka,
the Philippines, and Thailand. He laughs and says

his great-aunties sat in a circle weaving coconut leaves,
and if you pressed your ear to their woven mats,

you could still hear their gossip and singing, even after
they died. And because circles make memory seem less broken,

he recalls his great-uncles, too, sat in a circle braiding
dried coconut fibers into rope, used to lash canoes

and thatched houses, just as our veins bind our genealogies
to endure the lashing of waves and conquest. I read aloud

the nutrition facts label: 45 calories, 30mg sodium,
470mg potassium, and 11g sugar. Fat and cholesterol free.

He responds with this origin tale: once, a young girl,
beloved by our entire island, dies during a time

of drought. The family buries her and weeps upon
the grave, from which an unfamiliar tree sprouts.

They watch it grow and bloom until its hard, strange
fruit falls and opens on impact. The girl’s mother braves

the first sip, then smiles for the first time in years,
as if her body, after having been completely emptied,

is finally replenished. From that harvest, we planted
a sapling whenever a child was born. As generations

passed, the trees became kin, teaching us how to bend
without breaking, how to create without wasting,

and how to take without depleting. My dad tells me,
during his last visit home, that invasive beetles

are devouring our coconut trees. We discard the aluminum
cans in the recycling bin and swallow the bitter aftertaste.

Family Trees
written for the 2016 Guam Educators Symposium on Soil and Water Conservation

1

Before we enter the jungle, my dad
asks permission of the spirits who dwell
within. He walks slowly, with care,
to teach me, like his father taught him,
how to show respect. Then he stops
and closes his eyes to teach me
how to listen. Ekungok, as the winds
exhale and billow the canopy, tremble
the understory, and conduct the wild
orchestra of all breathing things.

2

“Niyok, Lemmai, Ifit, Yoga', Nunu,” he chants
in a tone of reverence, calling forth the names
of each tree, each elder, who has provided us
with food and medicine, clothes and tools,
canoes and shelter. Like us, they grew in dark
wombs, sprouted from seeds, were nourished
by the light. Like us, they survived the storms
of conquest. Like us, roots anchor them to this
island, giving breath, giving strength to reach
towards the Pacific sky and blossom.

3

“When you take,” my dad says, “Take with
gratitude, and never more than what you need.”
He teaches me the phrase, “eminent domain,”
which means “theft,” means “to turn a place

of abundance into a base of destruction.”
The military uprooted trees with bulldozers,
paved the fertile earth with concrete, and planted
toxic chemicals and ordnances in the ground.
Barbed wire fences spread like invasive vines,
whose only fruit are the cancerous tumors
that bloom on every branch of our family tree.

4

Today, the military invites us to collect
plants and trees within areas of the jungle
slated to be cleared for impending
construction. Fill out the appropriate forms
and wait 14 business days for a background
and security check. If we receive their
permission, they’ll escort us to the site
so we can mark and claim what we want
delivered to us after removal. They say
this is a benevolent gesture, but why
does it feel like a cruel reaping?

5

Listen, an ancient wind rouses the jungle.
Ekungok, i trongkon Yoga' calls us to stand tall!
Listen, i trongkon Lemmai calls us to spread our arms wide!
Ekungok, i trongkon Nunu calls to link our hands!
Listen, i trongkon Ifit calls us to be firm!
Ekungok, i trongkon Niyok calls us to never break!
Listen, i halom tano' yan i taotaomona call us
to rise, to surround our family of trees and chant,
Åhe'! No! We do not give you permission!
Off-Island CHamorus

My family migrated to California when I was 15 years old.
During the first day at my new high school, the homeroom
teacher asked me where I was from. “The Mariana Islands,”
I answered. He replied: “I’ve never heard of that place.
Prove it exists.” When I stepped in front of the world map
on the wall, it transformed into a mirror: the Pacific Ocean,
like my body, was split in two and flayed to the margins. I
found Australia, then the Philippines, then Japan. I pointed
to an empty space between them and said: “I’m from this
invisible archipelago.” Everyone laughed. And even though
I descend from oceanic navigators, I felt so lost, shipwrecked

on the coast of a strange continent. “Are you a citizen?”
he probed. “Yes. My island, Guam, is a US territory.”
We attend American schools, eat American food, listen
to American music, watch American movies and television,
play American sports, learn American history, and dream
American dreams. “You speak English well,” he proclaimed,
“with almost no accent.” And isn’t that what it means to be
a diasporic CHamoru: to feel foreign in a domestic sense.

Over the last 50 years, CHamorus have migrated to
escape the violent memories of war; to seek jobs, schools,
hospitals, adventure, and love; but most of all, we’ve migrated
for military service, deployed and stationed to bases around
the world. According to the 2010 census, 44,000 CHamorus
live in California, 15,000 in Washington, 10,000 in Texas,
7,000 in Hawai‘i, and 70,000 more in every other state
and even Puerto Rico. We are the most “geographically
dispersed” Pacific Islander population within the United
States, and off-island CHamorus now outnumber
our on-island kin, with generations having been born
away from our ancestral homelands, including my daughter.

Some of us will be able to return home for holidays, weddings,
and funerals; others won’t be able to afford the expensive plane
ticket to the Western Pacific. Years and even decades might pass
between trips, and each visit will feel too short. We’ll lose contact
with family and friends, and the island will continue to change
until it becomes unfamiliar to us. And isn’t that, too, what it means
to be a diasporic CHamoru: to feel foreign in your own homeland.

And there’ll be times when we’ll feel adrift, without itinerary
or destination. We’ll wonder: What if we stayed? What if we return?
When the undertow of these questions begins pulling you
out to sea, remember: migration flows through our blood
like the aerial roots of i trongkon nunu. Remember: our ancestors
taught us how to carry our culture in the canoes of our bodies.
Remember: our people, scattered like stars, form new constellations
when we gather. Remember: home is not simply a house,
village, or island; home is an archipelago of belonging.
Ode to Fina'denne' & Kikkoman Soy Sauce

1

A wood carving of the last supper
hangs on the wall above our dining table
in Mongmong, Guam, circa 1980s.
Where’s the fina'denne'? I wonder.

2

Fina'denne' (pronounced fin-ah-den-ee)
is the most important condiment, sauce,
and/or marinade in CHamoru cuisine:

1 part soy sauce
1 part lemon/lime juice or white/coconut vinegar
chopped onions (white and/or green)
chopped donne' (red chili peppers)
chopped tomatoes and/or garlic (optional)

Mix in a bowl, chill, serve.

3

Fina'denne' is holy water
at every special CHamoru event.
Spooned over rice, grilled meat and fish,
cooked vegetables, and even green salad.
On Guam, fina'denne' is served
at McDonald’s and KFC.
It was recently featured in Saveur Magazine,
and now has its own Wikipedia page!

4

On ordinary days, my dad
simply places the soy sauce
bottle in the middle of the table.

“Who’s Kikkoman?” I once asked him.
In his myth-making voice, he bellows:
“Kikko is an ancient CHamoru chief
who once caught 10,000 green sea turtles
and stored their tears in bottles.”

“And soy,” he says. “Soy is a magic bean
that grows in the Far East. The turtles eat them
before swimming to Guam. It means, long life.”

5

I stare at the Kikkoman bottle and imagine
the Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate fighter jets
that bombed our island on December 8, 1941.
I stare at the red cap and imagine
the imperial rising sun of the Japanese flag,
how my grandparents were forced to bow
during those violent years of occupation,
how the blood of 1,000 CHamorus
marinated the land. Yet

where the Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere failed,
the Greater Asian Amino Acids
Concentration Sphere conquered:
our stomachs continue to bow
to the fifth taste of “umami”
(pronounced oo-ma-mee),
and the sixth taste of empire.

6

Now, listen to the legend of Kenji Ekuan:
as a child, he watched his mother pour soy sauce
from a half-gallon bottle into a tabletop dispenser.
He witnessed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
His younger sister died in the explosion.
His father, a Buddhist monk, died from cancer.
Kenji traced his father’s shadow and became a monk
at a temple in the ruined, irradiated city.

Having faced nothingness, Kenji decided to make
human things. He studied art, started a design company,
and after three years and 100 prototypes,
created the transparent Kikkoman bottle in 1961.

“The shape is gentle,” he once said. “During the war,
we were forced into acting differently. But for 1,000 years,
the history of the Japanese people was very gentle.”

Kenji also became famous for designing
motorbikes and bullet trains.

7

More than 300 million Kikkoman soy sauce dispensers
have been sold in more than 70 countries since then.
They infiltrate every CHamoru kitchen and table.
Soy sauce gently bullets through our intestines.

“Is it healthy for me to consume soy sauce every day?”
“Is Kikkoman soy sauce made from genetically-modified soybeans?”
“Are companies like Kikkoman testing on animals”

“Does sodium increase blood pressure and heart disease?”

8

I watch my dad chop the ingredients
and place them in an empty bowl.
“Pass me the ketchåp,” he says.

In CHamoru, the word for soy sauce is ketchåp,
which is also our word for American tomato ketchup.
“Same difference,” he says.

I ask him: “If soy sauce is Japanese,
what makes fina'denne' CHamoru?”

“It’s CHamoru,” he smiles, “because
we made it better, we spiced it up.”

He raises and tilts the teardrop
shaped bottle until it bows to us.
Guam, Where America’s Voting Rights End

1

My 7th grade social studies teacher made us,
the children of Guam, memorize the names of
all 41 American presidents, whose portraits stared
down at us in the furthest American territory
from the White House. As I recited their names
at home, my parents watched Bill Clinton play
saxophone on television. “Are you voting for him?”
I asked. My dad, wearing his Army t-shirt, said:
“Didn’t your teacher tell you that our votes don’t
count. It doesn’t matter that we’re citizens or veterans.”

2

A few years later, my family migrated to California,
where I became a resident, graduated high school,
and registered to vote. But after Al Gore lost,
I learned that living in the States doesn’t guarantee
your ballot will actually count. I learned how easy
it is to memorize the name of a president who wages
two wars and sharpens your island into a weapon.
And isn’t that what an American president is: a name
to which our lands and bodies are ultimately sacrificed.

3

When Barack Obama campaigned in 2007, his name
gave me hope because it descended from slavery,
from the civil rights movement, from a mixed raced family,
from the Pacific. Yet Obama only visited Guam once.
In 2011, his plane landed at night on the air force base,
refueled, then departed. That’s when I learned the arc

of history doesn’t bend justice towards Guam. I learned
no matter what the president’s name is, he remains our
commander, and our island remains a forgotten name.

4

For thirty years, a straw poll in Guam has accurately
predicted the result of US presidential elections. In 2016,
Hillary Clinton won the poll, yet still lost to Donald Trump,
thus breaking our historic (and ironic) streak. I voted for
neither candidate, which felt like a betrayal to my kin
back home, who don’t have a voice in the election.
Some activists now petition to extend voting rights
to the territories; instead, I want our decolonial
voices to be counted, I want Guam’s liberation
from American presidents to be inaugurated.
SPAM’s Carbon Footprint

Guam is considered the SPAM® capital of the world. On average, each CHamoru
consumes 16 tins of SPAM each year, which is more per capita than any country
in the world. Headline: Guam Struggles to Find Its Roots From Beneath Growing
Piles of SPAM. Guam, Hawaii, and Saipan have the only McDonald’s restaurants
that feature SPAM on the menu. I went to the “World’s Largest K-Mart” in Guam and
I was amazed at the SPAM display … it was like a whole “Wall of SPAM.” SPAM has
a place not only in the stomachs of Guam’s people, but in our hearts as well. Here
SPAM is considered a gourmet luxury and is often presented as a gift at birthdays,
weddings, and funerals. Hormel even made a Hot and Spicy SPAM especially for-
mulated for Guam with Tabasco already added to it! A culinary legacy of American
troops stationed in the Pacific during World War Two, the GIs noticed how much the
people of Guam loved SPAM, so they started to jokingly call it “CHamoru Steak.”
Not coincidentally, SPAM is also popular in Hawai‘i, the Philippines, Okinawa, and
Saipan, all places with a history of a US military presence. In fact, SPAM may have
been responsible for Hitler’s defeat. The Allies would not have won WWII without
SPAM. Plus, it’s processed so I guess we can keep it forever right? Wow, I haven’t
seen this much SPAM since I lived on Guam and the car dealership there started
offering 50-lb bags of rice and cases of SPAM with every purchase. The end result
can be found in the newspaper’s obituary pages. In 2004, Public Health reported
that heart disease was the leading cause of death in Guam, representing 33.7% of
deaths. You can rub the entire block of SPAM, along with the accompanying deli-
cious gelatinous goo, onto wood furniture. The oils from the SPAM moisturize the
wood and give the furniture a nice luster. Plus, you’ll have enough left over to polish
some of your neighbors’ furniture. You’ll be like Santa Claus meets Mr. Clean. How
did I miss hearing about the “In Honor of Guam’s Liberation” SPAM! I thought I
had collected them all! But as I got older and tried to be “healthier” (whatever that
means, haha), SPAM faded from my consciousness. Then I met my future wife, who
is Hawaiian, and SPAM became part of my life again. Maybe the economic down-
turn will help people truly appreciate SPAM instead of loathing it. SPAM doesn’t
have to be unhealthy. I eat SPAM on a regular basis and I’m not dead yet. Just switch
to SPAM Lite. In the devastating wake of Typhoon Omar, SPAM arrived. Hormel
Foods donated 40,000 cases of the belly-filling foodstuff to the Salvation Army’s
disaster relief effort. That’s about six million SPAMburgers! Despite rumors, SPAM

is NOT made of such odds and ends as hooves, ears, brains, native people, or whole
baby pigs. SPAM is for realz made of pork shoulder, ham, salt, water, sugar, and
sodium nitrate, if you can belief it. The name itself stands for Specially Processed
Army Meat, Salted Pork And More, Super Pink Artificial Meat, Squirrel Possum And
Mouse, or Some People Are Missing. My uncle is the reigning Guam SPAM king. He
won the last SPAM cook-off with his Spicy SPAM meatballs. I will never forget the
two-pound SPAM bust of George Washington he made for Liberation Day, toasted
crispy on the outside with raw egg yolk in the hollow center. The kids loved it! Only a
fool would start a company in Guam that provides SPAM protection. We don’t want
to be protected from SPAM bots. For Xmas, I bought a SPAM snow-globe featuring
a can of SPAM sitting on an island; turn it over and a typhoon swirls madly, unable
to unseat SPAM from its place of honor. I have a souvenir can I bought after seeing
Monty Python’s SPAMALOT on Broadway. It cost me $10 and is the most expensive
SPAM I’ve ever bought. I will never eat it.
SPAM’s Carbon Footprint II

SPAM® was born on July 5, 1937, in Austin, Minnesota—the home of Hormel head-
quarters and the SPAM museum #cubistartyoucaneat. Eight pounds of SPAM die
in every CHamoru stomach each year, which is more per capita than any other eth-
no-intestinal tract in the world. Motto: “Guam is Where the Impure Pork Products
of America Begin!” Our guttural love of SPAM was born in 1944, when cases of the
shiny cans were berthed from aircraft carriers. That fateful day when my grand-
parents first tasted SPAM is commemorated as the Feast Day of the Immaculate
Consumption. St. Hormel, pray for [us]. The rest of the story is gestational genealogy,
a delicious cycle. Sadly, military recruiters are now worried that young CHamorus
have become too unhealthy and obese to enlist in the armed forces. My food phi-
losophy is simple: I eat therefore I SPAM. How can I prove that I’m an authentic
Indigenous person and not a SPAM script? At this year’s Hormel SPAM Cook-Off in
Guam, the Polish inspired “Pika Pieirogi” ousted the “Crispy Wanton Spam Ravioli”
for first place. I’ve eaten turkey SPAM, smoke-flavored SPAM, hot and spicy SPAM,
garlic SPAM, SPAM lite, Portuguese Sausage flavored SPAM, and more! When did
our lives become so complicated and post-modern? WSFWJE? What SPAM Flavor
Would Jesus Eat? Come closer, closer, and I will whisper to you, in my sexy voice,
“google the SPAM factory’s dirty little secret.” Oooohhh baby, here I am, come rub
up on my belly like SPAM jelly—Oooo baby here I am, come rub up on my belly like
SPAM jelly, Spam-Spam-Jelly, Spam-Spam Jelly! #mandatorymarley. In the morn-
ing, we can bring our SPAM labels to the Sorensen Media Group Offices in Hågatña,
and redeem 12 labels for a SPAM shirt and 9 for a SPAM hat. Guam is an acronym
for “Give Us American Meat.” My favorite scene in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of
Wrath (b. 1939) is when the tractor driver takes a lunch break near a tenant house
and eats his sandwich of white bread, pickle, cheese, and SPAM. The curious, starv-
ing children surround the driver, watching his hands carry the SPAM to his mouth.
Once upon spiral time, a CHamoru brother and sister refused to eat SPAM, so their
Authentic CHamoru Grandmother banished them into the diaspora and cursed
them to a life without meat. The vegetarian siblings migrated to Minnesota, where
they opened the world’s first vegan butcher shop and sold meatless meats at farmers
markets and pop-up events. They dedicated their lives to creating the perfect vegan
SPAM. They tried vital wheat gluten. They tried garbanzo tapioca flour. They tried

peanut butter. “The flavor’s good but the texture’s off,” they say in unison. “SPAM is
just a difficult whale to catch.” If they succeed, I will never eat it.

Intersection of Identity in Three Generations of CHamoritas and Filipinas in Guam Sharleen Santos-Bamba (Tabitha Caser Espina)

Gracing Alupang Beach is a statue that epitomizes the women of Guam and their
rootedness in culture and home. “The Women of the Island—Three Generations”
statue (Figure 1) was based on a design by local CHamoru artist, Ron Castro. Castro’s
mother, daughter, and niece posed for artwork meant to show the women of Guam
waiting at the shore for the men to return from fishing (R. Castro, personal commu-
nication, March 2017). Later, Alupang Beach Towers commissioned Italian sculptor,
Roberta Giovanni, to take Castro’s art and create a bronze statue to be placed along
the beach shore. Three generations of women, together, waiting, listening, anticipat-
ing the return of their men from sea.

In the same way, this chapter acts as a return. The women of the following nar-
ratives are together, waiting and listening not for men, but for their own voices to
come ashore in solidarity. CHamorus and Filipinos are historically the two largest
populations in Guam, at 37.3% and 26.3%, respectively (Central Intelligence Agency,

2017). CHamorus and Filipinos have a long, complex, and interwoven history of
immigration, competition, and intermingling. While most research describes this
interaction broadly, we turn to the voices of these women to relate the dynamics
and motivations of these two populations through the literate and spiritual lives of
CHamoru and Filipina women themselves.

Note. Photograph courtesy of Lakeisha Tenorio Espina, 2021.
As a way to unpack the complex identities of CHamoru women in Guam, Dr.
Sharleen Santos-Bamba (2010) makes use of a trove of interviews and historical re-
cords to trace the literacy trajectories of three generations of CHamoru women in
modern Guam. Tabitha Espina Velasco (2013) uses autoethnography to explore the
identity formation of three generations of Filipinas in Guam. As members of both
these populations, we decided that an intergenerational and intercultural examina-
tion of our work would be productive in exploring the plurality, complexity, and
interrelatedness of these female identities in Guam and how they are affected by the
intersections of gender, race, and culture. In this chapter we examine the ways these
women perceive quality of life, spirituality, and cultural perpetuation in Guam.

Our approach manifests CHamoru feminist scholar Laura Souder’s claim in the con-
clusion of her seminal text, Daughters of the Island: Contemporary Chamorro Women
Organizers on Guam. Although Souder (1987) does not explicitly address CHamoru
and Filipina relations, she does recognize the value of comparing CHamoru women
with other groups in Guam (p. 237). Our partnership through our work acknowledg-
es a relationship between CHamoru and Filipina women in Guam that has largely
gone unexamined. The current era of contact between Filipinos and CHamorus
has deep historical roots in the advent of Western colonization. From 1521 to 1898,
Spain colonized Guam and the Philippines, and Guam fell under Spanish colo-
nial domination for more than two centuries, resulting in intermarriages between
CHamoru women and immigrant Filipino laborers, according to local Filipina
scholar Clarisa Quan (n.d.).

Filipino immigrants were brought to Guam en masse after World War II as laborers
(Quan, n.d.). Men from Iloilo and the Visayas were recruited by construction com-
panies to assist in the rebuilding of Guam’s infrastructure. They worked hard and
performed well to avoid being returned to the Philippines. The money they earned
as laborers was far more than what they would have earned at home. The disparity
in wages today is comparable to 60 years ago. In 2010, the average household income
in Guam was $49,263 (Guam Chamber of Commerce, n.d.), while in the Philippines
the average household income in 2012 was 235,000 PHP, approximately $4,643 USD
(Philippine Statistics Authority, 2013). For 75 years, Filipino immigrants have sought
greater financial opportunities in Guam.

Campbell (1987) notes that Filipinos have left a major imprint on Guam’s histo-
ry, and Quan (n.d.) affirms that some of the richness of Guam’s history owes to
Filipinos’ contributions. Filipinos have helped to build Guam’s infrastructure,
establish local businesses, participate in local politics, and contribute to the cul-
ture of the community through humanitarian and service efforts, such as various
chapters of the Lion’s Club, the Filipino Community of Guam, and the Bayanihan
issues within the Pacific Daily News.

Despite their shared history, forged through the oppressions of colonialism, an-
imosity between Filipinos and CHamorus began with what James Perez Viernes
(2015) documents as “The Filipino Question” (p. 218). In 1926, Philippine Congress
Representative Edward Marcaido petitioned for Guam to be annexed to the
Philippines because of the “overlapping histories and racial similarities between the
CHamoru and Filipinos” (Viernes, 2015, p. 218). This provoked vehement responses
from CHamorus. The following are quotes from various CHamoru congressmen:
     “It is a well known [sic] fact that, while the people of Guam and the Filipinos
     belong to the brown race, they do not have the same peculiarities, interests,
     and habits … [These differences are a] very clear reason why the Filipinos and
     Chamorros will never be friends … The Chamorro has at heart that he is a
     better man than the Filipino.” (Viernes, 2015, pp. 220-223)
Overall, congressmen asserted racial difference, and CHamoru racial superiority,
citing presumptions that CHamorus were more highly evolved when it came to emo-
tional character, spiritual faith, and philosophies of respect and good governance.
These perceived differences, in turn, continued to perpetuate divisiveness and com-
petition between CHamorus and Filipinos. Today, such divisiveness persists. So long
as there are ethnic, national, or religious variations in a community, there are bound
to be differences in ideology, epistemology, and perceptions of quality of life.

In addition to this history, our own lived experiences have shown us that CHamorus
and Filipinos have not always gotten along. As recently as the 1960s through the
1980s in Guam, CHamoru-Filipino battles and street fights broke out daily—bat-
tles over territory and gang fights, often drawn between ethnic lines, the immigrant
versus the Indigenous. These differences, fortunately, have defused in recent gen-
erations. Much of the antagonism that had lasted almost two decades can possibly
be attributed to the legacy of colonialism that both groups have had to endure.
Increasing recognition of the ramifications of colonialism has resulted in increased
collaboration and cooperation.

What changed this relationship in later years, however, was intermarriage.
CHamoru men married Filipinas, and Filipino men married CHamoritas. They had
children, and their bi-cultural children grew up alongside CHamoru and Filipino
children. Today, most CHamoru families claim Filipino family members, and most
Filipino families claim CHamoru family members. Campbell (1987) refers to this re-
lationship as “cultural consanguinity,” historically and biologically intertwined (pp.
3-7). The historiographies of the CHamorus and Filipinos in Guam, however, have
largely been documented as parallel. There is much less literature devoted to the in-
terconnectedness or historical relationships between CHamorus and Filipinos, and
there are no studies that focus specifically on the female perceptions, complexities,
similarities, and nuances between the generations of CHamoritas and the genera-
tions of Filipinas who call Guam home. To address this void, we engage together and
begin to share space.

Generations
Santos-Bamba (2010, 2013) delineates three generations of CHamoritas in relation
to World War II. The first generation of CHamoritas, G1, were born before WWII
and experienced the hardships of war. CHamoritas of the second generation, G2,
were born during the postwar reconstruction period. This was a time in Guam when
Americanization through education and the media led to banning the use of the
CHamoru language and marginalizing Native culture and traditions, as a way to
compel CHamoru acculturation. The third generation CHamoritas, G3, were born
in the 1970s and 1980s and are descendants of G2 and grand-descendants of G1.
They attended school in Guam when English and CHamoru were both recognized
as official languages of Guam, hence they were not subjected to the English-only
policies of the early postwar period. English, more than likely, was their first lan-
guage in the home. While a fourth generation was not included in Santos-Bamba’s
study, she notes anecdotally that children of G3 have expressed the significance of
the CHamoru language and culture in their lives, similar to their mothers’ expe-
riences. This fourth generation makes use of CHamoru in personal and spiritual
domains through prayer and song. During an informal conversation with Santos-
Bamba, an 8-year-old said, “My grandma and mom speak to each other in Chamorro

sometimes. They do that when they don’t want us to understand. [Laughing] But we
understand what they are saying!”

In her chapter, “The Halo Halo Generation: Identity Formation in the Narratives of
Third Generation Filipinos on Guam,” Espina Velasco (2013) describes three genera-
tions of Filipina women, using metaphors from Filipino desserts. Espina Velasco uses
the Tagalog term ube (purple yam) to characterize the generation of Filipinas who
were the initial generation in their families to emigrate to Guam from the Philippines.
Espina Velasco uses the term sapin sapin, literally “layers,” to characterize the second
generation of Filipinas in Guam. This generation is characterized by a “layering” and
hybridity within their syncretic identity. Espina Velasco terms the third generation
of Filipinas the Halo Halo generation, after the Filipino halo halo dessert, as various
ingredients significant in Filipino culture are subsumed and are literally “mix mixed”
in a white milk concoction to become indistinguishable. In the same way, this gener-
ation’s Filipino cultural identity is dispersed among other elements.

Quality of Life
CHamoru women generally are expected to hold the family together, nurture faith,
and protect the home. The ways they do this involve language. For G1, literacy was
sought for education and professional work and was not necessary for home life.
While English was the vehicle for academic and professional endeavors, for G1 the
CHamoru language was the language of the home.

Having observed life within the military from their vantage “outside the fence,” and
seen stateside lifestyle via the media, G2 yearned for a quality of life that mirrored
their American counterparts. Guam swiftly moved from subsistence to a cash-based
economy following WWII (Santos-Bamba, 2010). G2 then entered the workforce
and contributed to their household finances. Some had college degrees, but most
did not. Because of dual household incomes, they made enough money to travel,
build modern homes, buy new cars, and eventually send their children to college.
Education and being literate in English were priorities instilled in their children
because it was American education and the English language that afforded oppor-
tunities for an elevated quality of life. In interviews, the women of G2 expressed
their sense that entering the workforce and contributing to their household incomes
provided an improved quality of life that included the comforts of modernity, travel,
and material goods.

Born in the 1970s and 1980s, G3 was greatly influenced by their grandmothers, the
first generation, because their G2 mothers had entered the workforce. Most third
generation CHamoritas spent a significant amount of time with their grandmothers,
which in turn led them to embrace the traditional coupled with the modern. Some
examples of this include the preparation of traditional foods like kadun mannok,
faith-based practices like rosaries and novenas, and domestic duties like caring for
a home and family. Another prime example is the practice of showing respect when
greeting an elder, fanngigne'. Fannginge' is the act of sniffing an elder’s right hand to
inhale or receive their wisdom, strength, and courage (ånimu).

The three generations of Filipinas in Guam, like their CHamoru counterparts, also
deployed language to improve their quality of life. The writings by and interview
with Espina Velasco’s grandmother, Ruthie Alvarez Caser, describe her feelings
of alienation and disillusionment upon her initial arrival in Guam: “I cried! I was
trapped … I was really crying for a few days, in spite of me with my husband. Yeah.
I was so sad … ” (as cited in Espina Velasco, 2016, p. 87). Like the CHamoritas in G1,
Caser and others in the Ube generation attempt what Espina Velasco terms “(ho)
me-making,” the simultaneous making of both home and self, in Caser’s case while
being a homemaker in the family. Like the CHamoritas in G1, the diary entries and
letters Caser wrote to Espina Velasco’s great-grandmother depicted her identity for-
mation, but through the difficulties of immigration. Caser, like the CHamoritas in
G1, describes choosing family over education. Narratives from Bruce Campbell’s 1987
survey of Filipino immigrants in Guam and from Bernadette Provido, an original
Camp Roxas immigrant, also portray the Ube generation’s migrant identity as con-
stituted through a range of intersecting, competing forces and processes reconciled
through agency. Education, family, the impacts of World War II, and motherhood
were also topics that recurred. Like the CHamoritas, Filipina women have the re-
sponsibility of maintaining and upholding the family. Many Filipinas began to work
outside of the home to contribute to the livelihood of their families, and they use
their language to effect change outside the home, in the community.

Like G2 of CHamoritas, the Sapin Sapin generation has a quality of life greatly
influenced by the postwar Americanization of Guam. They use their literacy and
familiarity with American culture to navigate among competing identities. Songs
and books written by Espina Velasco’s mother, Alpha Caser Espina, a teacher and
recording artist, and other supplementary narratives by Vivian Dames, a Filipina
scholar-activist, and by Bernadette Schumann, producer of the film Under the
American Sun, display a paradox of assimilation, wherein assimilability is valued,
yet ethnic differentiation is also embraced (Espina Velasco, 2014). Their language
displays the intersectionality of multiple, layered identities that simultaneously
register oppression and privilege. While these women work outside of the home,
their labors are concerned with what is deeply felt inside home—trying to reconcile
multiple roles and expectations.

No other generation is more influenced by the Americanization of Guam than
the third generation. The narratives of the Halo Halo generation show a fluid
positioning, situated between a variety of different and often competing generational,
ideological, and moral reference points, including those of parents, grandparents,
and their own real and imagined perspectives about multiple homelands. Because
of the ambiguity of what constitutes home for this generation, language is more
concerned with reclamation for personal identity, rather than the maintenance of
a household. Like the CHamoritas of G3, the upward social mobility enabled by
previous generations of Filipinas in Guam have granted the Halo Halo generation
the privilege of considering identity apart from livelihood. Their connection with
Filipino culture is further removed, as Filipino customs and traditions are often
combined with aspects of their American culture. However, like G3 CHamoritas,
many young Filipinas are taught Filipino cultural values through cooking traditional
dishes like adobo and pancit, fulfilling domestic duties while going to work or school,
and maintaining spiritual practices, mostly through the Catholic Church. Just as the
younger generations of CHamoritas are taught the honorific practice of fannginge',
young Filipinas are taught to beso beso, or kiss the cheeks of friends and family,
and are taught to amen, showing respect by placing the hand of an elder on her
forehead. Kevin Nadal (2011) finds in his handbook Filipino American Psychology that
many young Filipino Americans in the US mainland have a culture that is “a hybrid
of indigenous and colonial values, beliefs, customs, and traditions” (p. 36), and
the same could be said of the young Filipino Americans in Guam. The Halo Halo
generation is unencumbered by the immigrant mentality of previous generations
and instead is diasporic in ideology and practice. For the third generations of both
CHamoritas and Filipinas, American media, in particular, perpetuates the process
of Americanization, as young people are increasingly exposed to contemporary
fashion trends and slang, world travel, and opportunities beyond Guam’s shores.
While Americanization has embedded itself in island culture through media and
education, both Filipino and CHamoru youth maintain their cultural values, as
seen in their collectivist cultures. While they may behave more independently than
previous generations, their independence fuels their commitment to their families
and communities. For example, many young adults are employed and live at home.
Not only do they support themselves, but they also contribute to their family’s well-
being. An added layer to this commitment is the choice that hundreds of college
students make to attend a higher education institution in Guam; remaining on
island makes obtaining a degree, contributing to household income, and fulfilling
familial responsibilities possible and economical—enabling young CHamoritas
and Filipinas to continue to aim for an increased quality of life.

Spirituality
Family and faith, for most CHamoru women, are the foundations for a secure quality
of life. Consequently, a shared element among all three generations of CHamoritas
is that CHamoru language remains significant in the private and religious domains
via song and prayer. In interviews with G1 CHamoritas, they remarked that the
CHamoru language was used for spiritual and religious activities and that CHamoru
was the language of the home. Literacy in the Native language manifested in the
form of religious materials like rosary and novena prayers and songs. Among G2
CHamoritas as well, the utility of the CHamoru language relates directly to religious
activities and familial relationships. As mothers, they exposed their children to and
encouraged religious devotion through family prayer, songs, and worship. Family
togetherness and interconnectedness were nurtured and transmitted through the
generations and they attributed much of this family strength to their faith. In G3, the
CHamoritas lament the erosion of their CHamoru language, which in turn affects
their faith. Certain practices and traditions are expressed in CHamoru or bilingually
as a way to preserve the language. However, while their understanding of CHamoru
may be satisfactory—having been exposed to the CHamoru language by their par-
ents, grandparents, and extended family—they are not confident in their ability to

converse in the language, and they sense some loss and longing for the language of
their people. They also realize that CHamoru language and literacy is personal and
important for maintaining CHamoru culture and identity, especially through faith
and practice in the Catholic Church in Guam. This realization and spiritual practices
and beliefs are also present in the lives of the children of G3. These children—along-
side their parents, grandparents, and often great-grandparents—engage in activities
that perpetuate their cultural and religious beliefs.

Similar patterns of spirituality appear among the generations of Filipinas in Guam.
The Ube generation used both English and Tagalog in letters and diaries to express
faith. For example, Caser’s letters begin with exhortations to God for the family’s
good health and happiness and often end with “God bless you!” and written prayers.
In the Sapin Sapin generation, faith is what motivates Espina to continue her work
in both music and teaching. In her scholarly work on abortion and the Catholic
Church, Dames (2003) contemplates the faith of Guam’s people and how it plays
a role in access to health services. Like the CHamoritas of G3, the Halo Halo gen-
eration also laments an erosion of language; many can only express themselves in
English. Their narratives do not directly address their faith and spirituality. Their
disillusionment and ambivalence owe in part to being limited in the ways to connect
with the faith of their family and culture through Native language.

Cultural Perpetuation
One distinct difference between CHamoru and Filipino women with regard to
identity is their sense of place. Specifically, CHamoru women are of the land, but
Filipino women and their descendants have a motherland other than Guam. It is
the difference between those who imposed and those who were imposed upon.
This distinction, however, is not meant to negate a relationship, but rather to help
make sense of the bifurcated, complex relationship between CHamoru and Filipino
women in Guam. The positionalities of these populations with regard to home come
to bear on the perpetuation of their individual cultures.

For the generations of CHamoritas, identity, culture, language, and literacy in Guam
have been displaced by the politicization of language. The three generations of
CHamoru women in Santos-Bamba’s study are the bearers of culture and language in
their respective families. They acknowledge that colonization, Americanization, and
modernization have influenced life and CHamoru culture in Guam, and although
their lives today may be quite different from their ancient CHamoru ancestors, the
stories of these generations of women coupled with what is documented in Guam
history, show that these CHamoru women embody the same values of their ancestors:
inafa'maolek, interdependence and helping one another, and mamåhlao, humility.

For the generations of Filipinas, cultural perpetuation remains complex, subject to
the multiple homelands and reference points of immigration. Assimilative process-
es and the exigencies of moving to Guam prevented many in the Ube generation
from perpetuating their language and culture within the home. Many feel that ori-
enting their children and grandchildren toward a more American lifestyle would
guarantee greater social mobility. For the Sapin Sapin generation, acculturative pro-
cesses and being able to navigate several subject positions simultaneously enable
them to transmit their culture through their narratives both inside and outside the
home. While they see Filipino culture as important, for the immigrants and their
offspring, movement and migration force them to consider what is necessary to
bring and to pass along.

Particularly for the third generation of both groups, cultural perpetuation is increas-
ingly constrained. The third generation of CHamoritas believe that Americanization
and modernization have forced the culture to evolve in positive ways, but have also
pushed many traditional beliefs and practices to the periphery, so much that people
have forgotten the meanings behind them. A prime example of forgotten meanings
is the CHamoru Catholic practice of rosaries for the dead. The 9 days of public
rosary and another 9 days of family rosaries—18 rosaries in total—is a way to show
respect to the deceased relative over an extended period of time. There are many
CHamorus who practice the 18 days of rosaries because “that’s just how it has always
been” without questioning the meaning behind the practice. Like the CHamoritas
in the third generation, many in the Halo Halo generation tend not to speak any
Filipino language and tend to be averse to Filipino customs. This is characteristic
of the self-denigrating Filipino colonial mentality, described by Filipino scholars
E. J. R. David (2013) and Renato Constantino (1966). Espina Velasco finds that, as a
Filipina, claiming an island girl identity in Guam is both problematic and conten-
tious, as she encounters questions of authenticity and belonging as both Filipina
and Guamanian—identities that are seen as mutually exclusive. Along with the

slam poetry of Verna Zafra, their narratives articulate the feelings of loss and disillu-
sionment experienced by the Halo Halo generation, subsumed in American culture
and unable to fully claim an “island” or even “authentic” Filipino identity.

Conclusion
Overall, this juxtaposition of CHamorita and Filipina lives is informative because
both are postcolonial subjects who have experienced oppression in similar and dis-
similar ways, particularly in relation to language. By presenting Guam subjects as
similar, yet distinct, we hope to increase solidarity and furthermore, to claim that
the only way to counteract the effects of colonialism is through unity. This is ad-
mittedly a beginning work but one that we hope will begin the sharing of space
between CHamoritas and Filipinas.

Our shared motivations in our individual research projects were the starting point
for our collaboration. We both desire for our communities to share their identities
on their own terms—with their own authority—in their own languages, as we ex-
plore how CHamorita and Filipina grandmothers, mothers, and daughters all share
a sense of connectedness and express “women’s ways of knowing” (Santos-Bamba,
2010, p. 58). For both CHamoritas and Filipinas, faith is significant in the mainte-
nance of language, culture, and community, and each of our studies emphasizes the
significance of intergenerational transmission of culture and language. CHamoritas
and Filipinas lament the loss of language through generations, even though they
recognize their own responsibility for the loss. The similarities between these pop-
ulations in Guam are too significant to ignore.

In launching this research, we hope to increase understanding of the ways language,
literacy, and identity in Guam have been and continue to be politicized as a result
of Guam’s colonial history and its ambiguous political relationship with the United
States. Guam’s language and culture have been directly influenced by colonialism,
Westernization, modernization, migration and integration of peoples, and the glo-
balization of English, and these influences can be seen in the ways that these women
use language for empowerment, faith, and family.

We hope that another implication will be increased collaboration between these
communities in Guam, which Teresia Teaiwa (1994) refers to as “s/pacific n/oceans
[that] honor the specificities of Islander experience, recognize the generic effects of
(neo)colonialism on all Islanders, and are committed to political and cultural coop-
eration at the regional level” (p. 102). Ultimately, the act of combining and analyzing
these two scholarly works together speaks to the need for increased collaboration
between CHamoritas and Filipinas in contemporary generations. Furthermore, it
confronts and counteracts historical perceptions of competition and animosity and
works within the complex relationship of cultural consanguinity.

As a CHamorita scholar and a Filipina scholar, we stand alongside the women of these
generations, resting upon their shoulders, like the female figures in “The Women of
the Island—Three Generations” statue. We add our voices to theirs. Additionally,
as a CHamorita scholar and a Filipina scholar, we stand alongside one another, at-
testing to the community of Guam that is formed by these two populations. Like the
statue, we stand firm on the foundations of the women who came before us. At the
same time, generations together, cultures together, we remain forged, resolute, and
immovable. We look on, toward the ocean, toward new horizons.

Bridging Cultures (Mary Therese Perez Hattori)

The word home immediately evokes thoughts of Guam though I have lived away
from home for over three decades. In this article, I will share some challenges that
we who move away from home face, and some strategies for surmounting those
challenges without relinquishing cultural identity and values.

One of the biggest challenges faced when first living away is homesickness, indicat-
ed by the frequent use of the word mahålang (yearn, desire, lonely) and its variants
by CHamorus who live away from home. The world of social media is replete with
instances or variants of the word as a theme, hashtag, keyword, and comment posted
by CHamorus who live away from the islands. One’s well-being is negatively im-
pacted by the separation from one’s homeland. Expressions of mahålang are often
posted in response to photos, stories, news, events, and even recipes about our home
islands in social spaces such as Pinterest, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, and blogs.
For those who no longer live in the islands, these images evoke feelings of yearning,
expressed in the comment, “Mahålang yu'.” Those from other Micronesian islands

have similar expressions—pwos (Chuukese/Carolinian), ngachalong (Ulithian),
ōn (Marshallese). I have not observed such a strong and consistent response by
American social media consumers who have moved away from their home states.

Even though we move away from the Marianas and call our new spaces “home,”
for many of us, there will always be a deeply felt yearning for our ancestral lands.
The deep sense of i minahalang can be softened by sustaining my CHamoru cus-
toms and values, and connecting to others. The pain of longing for home is eased
by belonging to various groups; one can mitigate those intense feelings of longing
that impede wholeness and affect well-being by finding spaces of belonging. I have
sought affiliation with communities that embody what Kawagley and Barnhardt
(n.d.) describe as groups that “have a remarkable capacity to open themselves up
and draw people into their lives.” I’ve made connections to Native scholars from
other Pacific islands, to advocacy groups who serve Micronesians in Hawai‘i, and
to Indigenous-serving educational institutions that seek new perspectives as they
expand and improve services for students from Micronesia.

I am aware that in many interactions with others, I may be one of the few CHamorus
the other people might meet. Due to the human tendency to generalize, the other
person may assume that anything I say or do, any impressions or emotions I might
evoke, may then be generalized to all CHamoru people. To help people understand
that I am a member of, but not a paragon of an entire people and culture, I often
begin my talks with a statement like, “I can only speak from my own personal per-
spective at this time and cannot speak for all CHamoru people, all Pacific Islanders,
or all Indigenous people.”

This cognizance of generalization carries a sense of responsibility for being an
exemplary representative of our people, a responsibility that sometimes seems a
burden. It is a factor that influences my public behavior and anything I produce.
CHamoru society is communal in nature, in contrast to the individualistic society
of the United States. This contrast is highlighted by the way personal introductions
are made in social and professional encounters and by the communal designations
used to refer to individuals. CHamorus introduce themselves by clan, village, and
family names before using personal names. Throughout my childhood, I was often
referred to by my surname and since I am a twin, was often simply called “dinga”
(CHamoru for “twin, double, fork of a road or tree branch”). Personal introductions
in social settings rarely involved the use of my first name. Another designation is
hagan Guåhan, daughter of Guam (literally “blood of Guam”); this encourages a
sense of being a representative of the island and her people.

When I conduct research, write a paper, or deliver a speech, there is an accountability
to others, a sense that I am crafting this work not only for myself, but for my family
and people. Professional endeavors are not undertaken for my own benefit, but for the
good of our community. In contrast, peers from the United States have the freedom to
perform these same acts as individuals, with no care or expectation of representing
their home states, other American people, or American culture in general.

Despite any feeling of burden, there are empowering possibilities in being a represen-
tative of our culture. For the last 4 years, I have served alongside other Micronesians
as cultural consultants guiding the Honolulu Museum of Art’s planning of an annual
Celebrate Micronesia Festival. Informed by members of the region, the festival is
an authentic representation of contemporary culture from the perspective of Native
peoples of the region. Another strategy for sustaining my CHamoru identity while
living away has been a process of reflection, articulation, and application. Living in
a foreign place forces me to reflect on my own identity. Academic studies have given
me the ability to articulate CHamoru ways of being, ways of knowing, and values.
I engage in what Dr. Michael Perez (2016) calls “academic sovereignty,” wherein I
employ and appropriate the language and tools of academia to assert my CHamoru
identity and shine a positive light on our culture. I have used Western principles
such as Authentic Leadership, Temporal Intelligence, and Culturally Sustaining
Education to construct conceptual bridges, pathways to understanding so that so-
phisticated CHamoru ideas are accessible to people from mainstream America. I
apply CHamoru ways to my professional practices of teaching, research, and lead-
ership. Applying the ethos of inafa'maolek in my leadership practice, I prioritize
relationships and communal identity by employing community-building activities,
establishing teams, and mentoring relationships to foster collaboration rather than
competition and cultivate feelings of belonging. My leadership philosophy reflects
a posture of stewardship, “the attitude that I am a custodian of the university’s re-
sources, be they material, financial, or human. I strive for equitable distribution of

assets and sustainability of efforts, mindful that present-day decisions and actions
will impact future generations” (Hattori, 2016a, p. 5).

Creative endeavors such as poetry and photography allow me to communicate the
esoteric, spiritual aspects of our culture in ways that resonate with other people,
thus building bridges between our cultures. As an example, I share a poem which
illustrates a CHamoru sensibility regarding spiritual connections to our elders:

i piluña (the feather)

From a still and empty sky
a lone feather emerges
the down of a bird
descends gradually
gently
slowly

it floats
down
down
down

alighting onto my outstretched palm

a soft sweet kiss
from the aniti
a powerful portent
a message

maolek......good
todu maolek.....all is well

Perhaps my tåta, now a taotaomo'na
always a pikaru
plucked it from a passing bird
and sent it as a gift
a feather drifting on the susurration of saina
the whispers of wise elders. (Hattori, 2016b, p. 53)

Creative expression has been an important aspect of the lives of other CHamoru
academics and artists who have lived for a time away from the Marianas. The poetry
written during this phase in their lives acts as bridges, connecting them to homeland,
to the Indigenous people of their temporary homes, and to subsequent generations
of CHamoru who have spent part of their lives away from home. Examples are the
poetry of my contemporaries Cecelia Lee Perez and Anne Perez Hattori, the work of
younger poets such as Kisha Borja-Quichocho, Anghet Hoppe-Cruz, Craig Santos
Perez, and emerging Matao/Ilokano artist Dåkot-ta Alcantara-Camacho (2017), who
includes a reference to “i piluña” in his song, Fangguålo', excerpted here:

if we don’t do the work to clear up all the hurt
we just pass it on to our children who really don’t deserve
more excuses for the nooses we tie around our selves
the truth is we can do this our ancestors here to help
i can hear them crying out people tell me they have seen
spirits in the form of feathers and grandma’s chanting in dreams
i know this is their message asking us to just believe
but I am not a priest and definitely not here to preach
just trying to craft a medicine to set our people free

It seems that many of us who live away from our home islands engage in this pro-
cess of reflection, articulation, and application of CHamoru ways, finding our own
paths to authentic lives that honor our heritage. By identifying and sharing the best
aspects of our culture, we can be agents of positive change in this world, wherever
we are, simply by being who we are.

Discovering Saipan Community Art Values (Angelyn Labadan)

Having been interested in art from a young age, I often found myself taking art class-
es and getting involved in as many art activities as I could. From elementary to high
school, and to the present day, I crave to satisfy my creative passions through making
crafts at home, creating works in the studio, participating in various art contests,
visiting exhibitions and galleries, and much more. However, during high school and
my early university years, I soon realized that the number of art activities, promo-
tions, and funding for such in the CNMI was limited or unavailable due to federal
funding blocks. This realization sparked an interest to uncover the reason for this
issue and to identify the benefits that art could provide for the CNMI community (if
and when the blocks are lifted).

There are often many questions asked about art. Is there a right or wrong in art? Is
there a real value to art? However, perhaps the most apt question for the CNMI is,
“Where is the art?” Are the arts in the CNMI fading due to lack of support and value?
These questions form the basis for the primary inquiry of this chapter: “What is

the value of art in the Saipan community?” The arts have played a major part in
our history, such as documenting events before the written word, and are proven to
have positive intrinsic and instrumental cognitive benefits. Despite this, there is a
noticeable lack of artistic outlets and production in the Saipan art community. Thus,
the study reported here is a prompt for future research to further increase art en-
gagement, art promotion, and creative projects such as public murals, art galleries,
or art institutions within the Northern Marianas community.

Art has value beyond merely aesthetic creation. Much literature has served to es-
tablish “benefits of the arts” that range from educational benefits like enhanced
creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, to socio-emotional benefits
such as positive impacts on one’s social skills, and growth in areas of independence
and cognition. Exemplars of such literature include the book Arts with the Brain in
Mind by Eric Jensen (2001) and the Cultural Trends journal article entitled “Measuring
the Intrinsic Benefits of Art Attendance” by Jennifer Radbourne, Hilary Glow, and
Katya Johanson (2010). In Arts with the Brain in Mind, Jensen (2001) states, “the visual
arts are an important part of brain-based education. They can enhance cognition,
emotional expression, perception, cultural awareness, and aesthetics; they can play
a significant role in the learning process” (p. 49). Likewise, numerous secondary
sources, ranging from newspaper articles, magazines, journals, and blogs from art-
ists all over the world and in Saipan, highlight the benefits of the arts. Although
there is much literature and research advocating the arts, there are indications in
Saipan that the value of art is not as well accepted as elsewhere. In many cases the
arts are viewed as optional or unnecessary. This perceived low value has resulted in
budget cuts in both school art programs and community art programs. Budget cuts
are mainly evident in public schools—which emphasize core subjects like math,
reading, and writing—and in communities where social issues like governmental
assistance are of higher priority. In light of these circumstances, this research ex-
plores the importance and value of the arts in the Saipan community.

The Psychological and Educational Value of the Arts
Blum’s 2011 study of the psychological birth of art states, “Prehistoric cave art was
created many thousands of years before the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge.
Later, written language appeared, long after spoken language and derived from pic-
torial script such as, hieroglyphics” (p. 197). This means that art was present before
humans developed into the “dominant” species but served as a useful tool for evolv-
ing humans. Evidence also shows the use of art at burial sites of ancestors and as an
expression of emotion and display of culture. Art still serves these purposes, but has
become even more vital as studies show how art can enhance brain functions as well.

The value of arts in education has been an ongoing debate in recent years and still
sparks arguments today. Despite many scientific studies advocating the implemen-
tation of arts in education, there are many other critical issues to consider, such
as funding and assessment. In Arts with the Brain in Mind, Jensen (2001) states that
“the visual arts are an important brain-based education … and can enhance cog-
nition, emotional expression, perception, cultural awareness … [The visual arts]
play a significant role in the learning process” (p. 49). An article entitled “Does Arts
Education Develop School Readiness” (Nevanen et al., 2014), reports on a study con-
ducted in Finland that measured the implementation of art programs in day care
centers and schools. The results showed “that the program motivated children and
aroused their interest in thinking, problem-solving, practicing, and learning” (p.71).
Similarly, other studies also advocate for greater inclusion of arts in the educational
curriculum or further endorse art programs for increased intrinsic and instrumen-
tal benefits. Eisner (2008), in his commentary “What Education Can Learn from the
Arts,” states, “The recognition of the demands and the contributions that the arts
make is of fundamental importance in justifying the place of the arts in our schools,
that is, as being central, rather than educational accomplishments” (p. 23). Jensen’s
(2001) research on the arts in education reveals positive test score correlations and
asserts that “the College Board says that the arts are vital … and knows the value
of the arts” (p. 60).

Despite strong support for increased art inclusion in education, other research
and observation show a fair number of schools cutting art programs due to lack
of funding, lack of understanding, and confusion in relation to the value of art. An
article from the National Federation of State High Schools (2013) states, “When
cutting programs, superintendents strive to cut those that have the least impact to
learning and that create the least amount of controversy. Wrongly, superintendents
often recommend cutting some of the fine arts programs” (para. 2). There are also
questions that continue to baffle some educators in regard to how the arts should
be assessed. If art is subjective and there is no right or wrong, then how will it be

assessed? And, if art does have intrinsic and instrumental benefits, how can these
benefits be measured in the classroom? In his book, Jensen (2001) asserts that art
can be assessed with three concepts: knowledge/content of art, responses to art, and
performance-related questions. Although the concepts of art assessment are still
being explored, studies of art and its effects not only on education but on the brain
can be said to be proliferating.

With regard to the current standing of the arts, arts partnerships, and funding in
the CNMI, the most relevant information can be found in the local newspapers, in
particular the Marianas Variety. While the newspaper has recorded the blocks on
funding from 2005-2018, one of its articles entitled “NEA Reinstates Arts Council’s
Eligibility to Apply for Federal Grants,” indicates that the council is once again able
to apply for funding and is determined to properly manage funds if they are granted
(Lirio, 2018). As of October 2021, Arts Council Executive Director Parker Y. Yobei
(personal communication, September 29, 2021) stated via email that
     The annual partnership [grant] with NEA was reinstated back in 2018. [However]
     During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we administered the grant from
     NEA towards recovery from Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu, in
     which community [art] projects like murals on gyms and power poles took place.

Surveying the Community
Two distinct surveys were developed, piloted, and distributed—one for the general
public (see Appendix A) and one for professional artists (see Appendix B)—to help
analyze the state of the arts in the Saipan community. Additionally, short interviews
were conducted with children regarding their perceptions of the arts. The interview
questions (see Appendix C) were based on the questions from the general survey,
but appropriately revised for the children’s ease of comprehension. Interviews
were conducted with 10 children. The surveys were distributed both electronically
and manually. The general survey garnered 29 respondents while the artist survey
garnered 11 respondents, many of whom were manually acquired at a local artists’
market. All surveys were open for about a month. The surveys and interviews gar-
nered responses from varying age groups (Figure 1). Responses were unique and
provided useful expressions of the Saipan community’s views on the value of art.

All professional artists held a similar view on the value of art, despite the varying
years and experiences in their professional careers. As a general consensus, artists
reported that the arts hold major importance in generating creativity and express-
ing oneself, as well as art being a key instrument in what makes people human.
Participant #1 highlighted the importance of art in education:
     While some are quick to dismiss the importance of art in school curriculum,
     art is just as important as any of the core subjects because art, any form of art,
     promotes freedom of expression, creativity, ingenuity, and critical thinking—all
     of which are vital in the pursuit of innovation and human development.
Participant #2 encouraged both the community and artists to play an active role in
the social art network: “A place where artists can perform together and have some
great time. [I’m] Dreaming [of ] a place in the vicinity of a busy place like in Garapan
area, so that other artists would be interested to show up their artwork.” Overall, the
artists expressed interest in all areas of visual arts and ranked drawing and painting
as the two top areas. When answering the survey question about Saipan’s strongest
and weakest aspects of visual arts, the consensus for strongest aspects of the art
community were community support for artists and youth involvement in art events
(see Appendix D). The consensus for the weakest aspects were lack of funding for
the arts, lack of support for artists, and lack of markets for artists. When posed with
the question about the quality of funding the arts received in Saipan, a majority of
artists rated the quality “very poor” or “poor” (Figure 2).

The last questions of the survey asked if the artists would be willing to go to a hy-
pothetical art gallery or public arts in Saipan and asked for suggestions of what
they would like to see in the art community. All the artist surveys reported that they
would go to a hypothetical art space. The following graph (Figure 3) displays the top
three kinds of art spaces they would like to see: (1) public art space, (2) mural space,
and (3) sculpture space. Meanwhile, the suggestions of other arts projects in the
community were as follows: a gallery, museum, cultural center, murals, and public
art activities for youth, more arts in education, and sculptures.

While the general public held varying views about funding, art interests, and the
quality of the arts in the community (See Appendix E), the general consensus among
those surveyed reflected the same perspective as the artists, “that the arts hold
a major importance in generating creativity and expressing oneself, as well as art
being a key instrument in what makes people human.” The general public expressed
interest in all areas of visual arts, although different age groups favored different art
interests. The 14-to-19-year age group preferred photography, film, painting, and
drawing (See Appendix F). The 20-to-29-year age group preferred drawing and
design (See Appendix G). The 30-to-39-year age group preferred photography and
film (See Appendix H). The 40-to-49-year age group preferred ceramics and design
(See Appendix I). In regard to art experiences, the younger age group displayed more
participation in art classes and events in comparison to the older age group. Despite
this contrast, respondents of all ages rated the quality of funding for the arts as rela-
tively “poor” or “fair” (Figure 4). creative events

Since there were more participants for the general public survey than the artist
survey, there were more suggestions about what types of projects would be a pleas-
ant addition to Saipan’s art community. These suggestions included permanent art
galleries, museums, monthly art events, rehabilitation of abandoned buildings,
roadside artwork, more business opportunities for local artists, free outdoor can-
vases, and art parks.

Among the children (ages 10–11) surveyed, most reported that they take part in
drawing. The children also stated that they do not see much art in the Saipan com-
munity other than during events like the Flame Tree Arts Festival. All the children
indicated that they would like to see more permanent art in Saipan, and that they
would be interested in going to a place where they learn more about art and could
experience creating art.

The general survey for the public garnered 29 responses and provided a useful view
of the Saipan community’s views on art. During data collection, other key topics of
concern arose such as the reasons for the lack of adequate funding for the arts in
the CNMI and Saipan. In one survey response, a professional artist stated that the
prolonged lack of funding in the arts community is due to a ban placed on the CNMI
by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from 2005 and was in place for 7 years
total. Presently, the ban placed by the NEA has been lifted and the recent efforts by
the Northern Marianas Humanities Council aim to cultivate and support the arts.
These efforts are currently being covered by the Marianas Variety.

Conclusions
The results of this research and survey suggest that the general consensus among
both the public and professional artists is that art is important and essential to all
human beings for creativity and expression. The survey group expressed positive
and high values for art despite the previous lack of funds and resources to establish
foundational creative communities and projects from 2005–2018. Survey partici-
pants also suggested a variety of ideas for possible future art projects. The prevalent
suggestions were galleries, murals, and sculptures. Due to this perceived value of
the arts, an artistically enthusiastic community, and newly reinstated funds, it can
be said that the possibility of strengthening Saipan’s creative community is stronger
today than in the past 10 years. Furthermore, the results from this paper could be
used by community leaders and members of the arts council as an aid when forming
plans for future events and grants.

The Thai Community in Saipan (Poonsri Algaier)

In the 1980s and 1990s, Saipan’s labor force opened internationally, with immi-
gration under local control by the Commonwealth government. Then, when the
international garment industry decided to turn the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands (CNMI) into one of its main hubs for production and shipment to
the USA, the local economy boomed. That boom attracted a pool of non-immigrant
workers from across Asia, and over time included among them thousands of people
from Thailand. The Thais who came to Saipan were very concerned about working
fast enough to be given the lucrative overtime work that was often available for the
most efficient workers in the factories. The vast majority of those who came are now
gone, returned to the houses they built on US wages, but some remain. The Thai
community continues to be represented among construction workers, massage spe-
cialists, restaurant workers, and others.

Most Thai people came to Saipan to work in garment factories. During the heyday
of the multiple factories, with UIC as the largest employer, over 2,000 Thai workers

called Saipan home throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thais were also work-
ing in construction, hotel businesses, and auto shops. There were up to four Thai
grocery stores, two in San Antonio and two in Chalan Kanoa. One of these original
grocery stores morphed over time into a restaurant—the Spicy Thai Noodle Place—
that still operates in Garapan as of 2018. Other Thai restaurants from the time, many
of which have since closed, include—The I-Thai, a Thai-Italian adventure; the Nid
Noi Café; Supanahong, Mai-Tai, and a number of unlicensed “casual” outdoor
places for Thai and connected non-Thais only. Some restaurants remained after
Typhoon Soudelor hit in August 2015, including two in Garapan, the Thai House
(since closed) and Wild Bill’s.

As Thais love Thailand, a clamor for representation prompted organization; thus,
in 1999, a Thai Association was formed. Dues-paying members supported annual
Loy Kratong and Songkran festivals events in the Fall and Spring which brought
together crowds of revelers from every part of island society and allowed the Thai
community to showcase their rich and deep culture. On the full moon night of the
twelfth lunar month, usually in November, a Loy Kratong festival was held. Events
would include Miss Nopamas beauty contests (Nopamas is a mythical character said
to have been the consort of King Ramkamhaeng of the ancient capital Sukothai;
she is supposed to have started the first Loy Kratong festival), junior Miss Nopamas
contests, banana float contests, traditional dance—ramwong—contests, food, songs,
dances, and lavish cultural displays. The first official festival began in 1999 after per-
sonal gatherings, parties that grew from year to year, were held on beaches in San
Antonio, and Thai Association venues, which lasted until 2006, included Susupe
Park and the Pacific Islands Club. Similarly, the Songkran Water Festival, known
simply as Songkran, would every year spark joyous celebration among Thais who
use the festival as a break from the dogdays of the hot season. In Thailand, Songkran
is a nation-wide water fight. In Saipan, it was celebrated as a day-long water ball,
barbecue, home-cooked feast, and dance party. Celebrations went on in Thai bar-
racks across the island; crowds at parties in the two Thai barracks in San Antonio,
separated by 100 meters, would grow so large one could stand in the middle of the
crowd and be in both parties at once. It was a joyous time.

The Thai Association also acted as a center to collect donations among commu-
nity members in time of need. Deaths on island, deaths in families back home,
home-destroying fires, or disasters either in Saipan or in the Kingdom were always
met with generous responses from community members. Thai Association members
performed community services such as clean-ups on beaches, in villages, and along
the roads. Thai dancers also performed at Flame Tree Festivals, Hot Chili Pepper
Festivals in Tinian, and village Saint Days. They trained children to dance and provid-
ed traditional Thai costumes for school children on International Days and Cultural
Days at various schools in Saipan. Unfortunately, by 2006, due to the rapid departure
of many former garment workers following the closure of that industry, the Thai
Association was effectively disbanded. Individuals still celebrate the Loy Kratong and
Songkran Festival with their friends and families, but no organizational structures
exist to make the holiday island-wide celebrations. The barracks that used to house
hundreds of Thai workers have largely disappeared, though some Thais continue to
stay in their former housing units as caretakers for the now-closed factories.

After the closing of the garment factories, many Thai workers had to leave. According
to a Thai labor survey completed in the first quarter of 2017, there were 143 Thai
citizens in Saipan (R. Charoenkhai, personal communication, November 7, 2018).¹⁸
Those who remain in the CNMI are those who married into the local community or
who got jobs after the garment industry disappeared. Some work as masseuses, taxi
drivers, farmers, or with restaurants, hotels, or other companies. Some have private
businesses, and some are homemakers. The movement of workers from Thailand
to Saipan largely ended with the closure of the garment factories. While a few Thai
workers continue to find their way to Saipan, these workers are usually arriving
through personal contacts with other Thais who are currently living here.

The following anecdotes are from a few Thais who still live in Saipan. Their
names are pseudonyms.

Som was a schoolteacher in Thailand, who, because of his eloquent speaking skills,
was assigned to be a Community Scouts leader. Community Scouts was a Thai gov-
ernment program to gather ordinary Thai people to fight against the communist
insurgency in Thailand. After working as a teacher, he tried his luck with con-
struction in the Middle East. He arrived in Saipan in 1991. He first worked for NTC
(now IT&E), then with Tano Group, a construction company. After that he worked
as a reverse osmosis operator for a golf course and as a security guard for Pacific

Amusement before he joined G4S Secure Solutions (CNMI) Inc. in 2014, where
he remains. While working here he was able to send his two children to school in
Thailand. His daughter has earned a master’s degree in early childhood education;
his son has a master’s degree in petrochemical engineering. Som assists the Thai
people here when they need to renew their passports, obtain Thai birth certificates
for their children, or deal with other documents. He is instrumental in arranging
for Thai consular officers to visit the island, as they did in February 2017, to provide
support for Thai citizens. He also assists the Thai Labor Department in Hong Kong
in collecting biodata from the Thai people here. The Labor Department in Hong
Kong has jurisdiction over Hong Kong, Guam, Saipan, Rota, Tinian, and Palau. Som
likes working and living here in Saipan. His only concern with island life is the way
US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) handles CW-1 visa¹⁹ renewals.
He says USCIS may send the worker’s acceptance letter either to his home country
or to Saipan. If the letter is sent to the home country, the worker will have to go back
home, apply for a visa, and wait and wait and wait. It could be weeks or months
before he can come back. During this indeterminate waiting period, financial prob-
lems become burdensome as workers must meet fixed-cost family obligations while
their income has stopped.

Orn is a female who came to work for UIC garment factory over 20 years ago. Through
hard work and smart financial management, at a time when the minimum wage in
Saipan was barely over $3 per hour, Orn was able to buy a house in Thailand. Still
in Saipan, she is now happily married and helps her husband with his business. She
and her husband built a house here too, and they have no plans to relocate anywhere
else for the foreseeable future. Orn loves to work in her garden. She enjoys hosting
parties on various Thai holidays at her house. For Loy Kratong Festival, she prepares
food and makes floats from banana trunks, banana leaves, and fresh flowers. Her
guests would enjoy the food and later that night go to the beach to float the kratongs
under the moonlight. Though their numbers are smaller, Thai people in Saipan still
follow their Thai traditions. On some occasions, Orn will still gather with others at
the shrine of Brahmin, to whom some Thai pray for help, at the old Onwel factory
ground. Comfortable with syncretic religious practices, Orn will also join others,
though she is not Christian, at the Santa Lourdes Shrine to entreat Santa Lourdes for
divine intervention. After petitioners get what they ask for, they would offer different
kinds of gifts, flowers, food, or dance to the sacred entity. Unlike Som, Orn does not
have to worry about a visa. She has a green card through her husband.

Prakai arrived in Saipan in 1994. She paid a recruiter 50,000 baht (about $2,000 USD
at the time) for bringing her here to work for the Sako garment company. She paid
him in two payments. There were basically three ways to come to work in Saipan at
that time. The first way was through the Thai Labor Department. The second way
was through a sponsor who could be a private person or a business owner. And the
third way was through a recruiter. After Sako, she got a job in a poker room and
worked there for a few years. For self-improvement, she took ESL classes offered
by the Adult Basic Education Program at Northern Marianas College. The course
was offered on Sundays to accommodate guest workers, and each student paid $40
for the 3-hour-per-week, 10-week course; hundreds enrolled in the courses, helping
both to better themselves and to strengthen their connections to the community.

Prakai is now 52 years old and works as a waitress in a restaurant. When asked if she
wanted to go back to Thailand, she said, “yes, eventually, but not now.” Her age and
her educational background are big obstacles. She thinks that at 52 it would be hard
for her to get a job in Thailand. She would also not make as much money as she
can in Saipan. The minimum wage in Thailand varies from province to province,
with the highest in Bangkok at 310 Thai baht, about $9 USD, per day in 2017. Prakai
notes that her future seems bright. If she is careful, she can cover her rent and elec-
tricity for about $250 per month in Saipan. She is saving up for her retirement in
Thailand. With more than 20 years of work in Saipan, she will also receive her US
Social Security benefits when she reaches the eligible age. She has also inherited
a house in Thailand from her parents. Her only concern now is about getting her
CW-1 visa renewal. Sometimes even when the employers file the renewal documents
in a timely manner, there are still glitches that cause the non-renewal of the CW-1
visa for their employees. Some Thai people who have US-born children are able to
get Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) to work here, but Prakai is not
one of them. Thus, the suspense and tension she feels while waiting for the renewal
of her CW-1 visa continues.

Prapa came to Saipan as an office worker for a garment factory. She has a vocational
degree from Thailand. She picked up both English and Chinese from hearing those

two languages in the factory, and she became fluent in both. She is now working as
a manager for a local company. Like many Thai men and women in Saipan, Prapa
enjoys playing soccer. She currently plays in a competitive women’s league on a
team that is predominantly Thai. She also stays fit by working out in a fitness center.
Married now, with two children, she is also a proud naturalized American citizen.

Over the past three-plus decades, the existing world trade regulations permitted a
booming economy in Saipan that was fueled by garment factories. Times changed,
however, and those factories went away. But Som, Orn, Prakai, and Prapa remained.
They arrived of their own free will. They created lives: they provided for others,
saved for retirement, raised families, bought land and built houses in their home
provinces, and came to love their homes in both their lands. The Thais in Saipan
came as fully engaged and cognizant economic actors finding their own roles as
stars in their own lives. Though fewer in number, they nevertheless persist, and con-
tinue to contribute to the Thai community and the wider Saipan community today.

Family Violence, Historical Trauma, and the CHamoru Manggåfa (the Family) (Lisa Linda S. Natividad)

I manggåfa (the family system) has consistently been the anchoring point of life
for CHamorus since time immemorial. CHamorus are the Indigenous peoples
of the Mariana Islands of Micronesia, who settled the islands nearly 4,000 years
ago. Cunningham (1992) describes the significant role that families played in so-
ciety: “Ancient Chamorros tried to meet all their obligations and always remain
loyal to their family” (p. 94). Despite this longstanding tradition, family violence is
a phenomenon that impacts CHamoru families today at alarming rates through-
out the Mariana Islands. According to the Guam Family Violence Act of 1998, it
is defined as follows:
     the occurrence of one (1) or more of the following acts by a family or household
     member, but does not include acts of self-defense or defense of others:
     (1) Attempting to cause or causing bodily injury to another family
     or household member;
     (2) Placing another family or household member in reasonable fear of immi-
     nent bodily injury; or

     (3) Knowingly or intentionally, against the will of another, impeding the normal
     breathing or circulation of the blood of a family or household member by apply-
     ing pressure to the throat or neck or by blocking the nose or mouth of a family
     or household member. (p. 3)
This chapter explores the intersectionality of family violence and the CHamoru
manggåfa (family system) by examining intimate partner abuse, child abuse,
and elder abuse. I review available family violence data in Guahån and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). To understand the plight
of CHamorus today within the context of colonization and oppression, I introduce
the theoretical framework of historical trauma. I also examine traditional CHamoru
concepts of gender, the marital relationship, parenting practices, and the role of the
elderly within the family. Lastly, I discuss implications for practitioners in the field
of social services working with CHamoru families.

Family Violence Across the Marianas Archipelago
People across the Marianas Archipelago have a long and well-documented history
of suffering under colonialism. Family violence is a social issue that affects many
Indigenous peoples with a history of colonization and CHamorus are no exception.
While the Guahån statute provides the framework for defining family violence, in
this chapter, I specifically explore abuse within the family system to include in-
timate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, and elder abuse. Each of these
categories can be more precisely identified by the specific type of abuse to include
physical, sexual, financial, emotional/psychological/verbal abuse, and neglect. To
further contextualize these statistics, I note that in the 2010 US Census, CHamorus
comprised 23.9% of the total population in the CNMI and 37.3% in Guahån (CNMI
Department of Commerce/Central Statistics Division, n.d.; US Census Bureau,
2014). The minoritization of the Indigenous population in the Mariana Islands is an
indicator of a colonial history that has disadvantaged the CHamoru family system
by setting the conditions for culture loss.

Data on family violence cases in the Marianas is uneven at best. In light of the
underreporting of cases, coupled with the limited capacity for the integration
of reported data, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive look at this social issue.
The Guam Police Department’s Domestic Assault Response Team (2016-2018) in-
timate partner violence statistics indicate the total number of cases in recent years
as follows: 1,442 (2016), 1,383 (2017), and 1,356 (2018). These numbers reflect cases in
four categories: kidnapping, intimidation, simple assault, and aggravated assault.
The Guam Statistical Yearbook 2017 reported family violence offenders by race
and indicated that Pacific Islanders (including people from the Federated States of
Micronesia) comprised between 81.3% to 85.5% of perpetrators for the years 2014 to
2017 (Guam Office of the Governor Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018, p. 250). In
2019, The Guam STOP Violence Against Women Primary Victim Data Collection
reported that CHamorus comprised a total of 32% of victims of violence. Similarly,
CHamorus comprised 30% of offenders. The reported gender of offenders was male
in 79% of cases and female in 21% of cases.

In looking more specifically at child abuse and neglect (CAN) cases in Guahån, Table
1 shows the number of referrals received by Child Protective Services (CPS) from 2012
to 2017 as reported in the Guam Statistical Yearbook 2017 (Guam Office of the Governor
Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018). Those figures indicate a gradual decrease in the
number of cases. Table 2 breaks down the total referrals by maltreatment type that
include physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as physical neglect. There are
also other forms of neglect not indicated in the table, including medical, educational,
and emotional neglect, abandonment, lack of adult supervision, and deprivation of
necessities. Table 3 reveals that the most reported co-occurring risk factor at the time
of CPS referral was drug use by caretakers. This confirms the confounding relation-
ship between violence and drug and alcohol abuse.

Note. From Guam Statistical Yearbook, 2017, by Guam Office of the Governor Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018,
http://bsp.guam.gov/wp-bsp-content/uploads/2019/01/2017-GU-STAT-YRBK_Final.pdf

In examining the cases of reported elder abuse in Guahån, the Bureau of Adult
Protective Services reported the number of referrals and indicated that CHamorus
demonstrated the highest percentage of referrals ranging from 67–69% between
the years 2016–2018 (Table 4). This percentage reveals the overrepresentation of
CHamoru cases in relation to their percentage (37.3%) of the island’s total population.
In addition, the types of reported maltreatment are ranked, with the highest number
of referrals for financial/property abuse, followed by neglect, and then emotional/
psychological maltreatment. These data clearly show that family violence spans the
life cycle, encompassing both child and elder abuse.

In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), family violence
is also a social issue impacting the community. According to Maurin (2019), “the
Office of the Attorney General prosecuted 73 cases of domestic violence. This was
on top of the 239 calls received by the Department of Public Safety regarding do-
mestic abuse.” While this social issue was traditionally hidden, denied, or excused
in the past, recent community educational efforts have helped to reframe the issue
as one of power, control, and violence (Lirio, 2018). According to the CNMI Office of
the Attorney General (2018), for the years 2015 to 2018, the lowest number of family
violence cases occurred in 2017 (48 cases) and the highest number in 2016 (77 cases).

Official statistics report 200 cases of child abuse and neglect in the CNMI in
2018 (Table 5) including a total of 337 allegations that included physical abuse,
sexual abuse, emotional abuse, negligence, and other factors (Table 6). The
distribution of cases was primarily in Saipan (185 cases), followed by Tinian (10
cases), and Rota (five cases).

As in Guahån, abuse of the elderly also occurs in the CNMI. According to Walter
Manglona from the Office on Aging, the most common type of elder abuse in
the Commonwealth is fraud, which he indicated includes financial exploitation
and scams (Robago, 2018). Further, he gave examples such as the misuse of an
elderly person’s personal checks, credit cards, or other accounts, as well as steal-
ing cash, income checks, household goods, forging signatures, and identity theft.
Manglona clarified that elder abuse also includes physical, sexual, emotional,
and psychological or non-verbal abuse and neglect.

The literature on violence within CHamoru families is sparse. Twaddle, Roberto, and
Quintanilla (2003) conducted a study examining CHamoru perspectives on mental
health issues and their context within Indigenous and Western cultural ideas. The
following is an excerpt from a participant discussing intimate partner violence:
     I think there is a lot of spouse abuse in my community and I think a lot of
     that stems from changes in the ancient Chamorro culture. Women used to
     be in control; they were the ones everyone respected. Somewhere along the
     line things changed and now it’s the man who acts as the master of the house
     … If they feel they’re not in control in the house, they react by thinking, “If I
     smack you a little harder, maybe you will notice that I am in control” [Female,
     38 years, Maite]. (pp. 40-41)
This participant’s sentiment was a reiteration of one offered by Rapadas (1997)
when describing perpetrators of family violence on Guåhan. Rapadas is a be-
havioral health provider who facilitated group therapy for male perpetrators of
family violence through the Superior Court of Guam. He discussed the regional
shift from traditional societies that were matrilineal to the current patriarchal
culture influenced by colonial powers, wherein men have risen to positions of
power in society and the family structure. Rapadas noted that this shift in values
and worldview may have led to a decline in the self-esteem and prominence of
women and their positioning within i manggåfa. Indications are that this rise of
patriarchy and decline of matriarchy provides a fertile ground for family violence
to occur. He offered as evidence for this phenomenon the consistent increase in
the number of cases of family violence in Guåhan.

Family violence has often been viewed as a poor coping mechanism of Indigenous
peoples living in the highly Westernized context of a colonized society (Cheers et
al., 2006). Colonization usually brings with it a shift in values and worldview, high
levels of stress from the need to acculturate and adapt to the new world order,
and feelings of inadequacy. Cheers et al. (2006) remind us that complicit with
colonization are experiences of oppression, dispossession, disempowerment,
dislocation, and poverty. Hence, CHamorus’ manifestation of family violence is
consistent with other Indigenous communities as they deal with the stressors of
life in an environment that disempowers the very essence of their identity in a
colonial context. These contemporary experiences are rooted in the erasure of
traditional systems that define Indigenous peoples, as well as the invalidation of
their very existence in modern society.

Historical Trauma, Family Violence, and Indigenous Peoples
The intersectionality of Indigenous peoples, family violence, and historical trauma
is a consistent theme in the relevant literature. Historical trauma is defined “as a
cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including
the lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma” (Braveheart et al., 2011,
p. 282). The concept of historical trauma has been used to describe the American
Indian experience of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and communal trauma
as a result of genocide, colonization, assimilation, and social exclusion.

Fast and Collin-Vezina (2010) conducted a meta-analysis of the literature ex-
amining historical trauma and Indigenous peoples. They shared findings from
Evans-Campbell, who highlighted the inadequacy of a PTSD diagnosis because
the diagnosis does not capture the trauma experienced across generations. Evans-
Campbell established three criteria for historical trauma: 1) it was experienced by
many people; 2) high levels of stress were generated: and 3) outsiders perpetrated the
events with destructive intent. She further posited that historical trauma impacts
the individual, the family, and the larger community: individuals experience depres-
sion, anxiety, or grief; families struggle with effective communication and parenting
issues; and the larger community exhibits a breakdown of traditional values and
practices, internalized racism, and high rates of social problems.

Gurm (2020) describes how Indigenous peoples continue to experience the effects
of trauma for generations, particularly as manifested in violence against women and
girls. Specifically examining Indigenous women in Canada, Gurm (2020) reports
that Indigenous women were twice as likely to experience intimate partner violence
as compared to non-Indigenous women. Indigenous peoples in Canada’s colonial
history repeatedly experienced the removal of children from their homes and their
placement in residential schools. Indigenous peoples were grossly over-represent-
ed in incarceration rates, comprising 27% of incarcerations in both 2017 and 2018
but only 3% of the population. Of those incarcerated, 50% reported experiences of
family violence as children. Equally shocking is the number of murdered and miss-
ing Indigenous women and girls in Canada, who are 12 times more likely to be killed
or go missing as compared to other ethnic groups (Gurm, 2020).
Gurm (2020) reports that Indigenous peoples globally suffer a comparable out-
come with high rates of family violence, as evidenced in the Aboriginal peoples of
Australia and the Māori of Aotearoa (New Zealand). Efforts to eradicate traditional
practices, coupled with inequality, racism, and the lack of cultural safety within sys-
tems, are traumatic experiences that contribute to family violence. Further, Vickers
and Moyer (2020) draw the connection between historical and ongoing colonialism
and the loss of identity and support, fragmentation of the family system, loneliness,
and psychological distress in Indigenous populations.

Unfortunately, CHamorus have suffered a similar fate as indicated in the afore-
mentioned statistics. The intersectionality of ongoing colonialism, war and related
invasions, the high risk for poverty, and structural racism helps to contextualize the
high rates of family violence for CHamorus in the Marianas. Their experience of
historical trauma is related to land dispossession, language loss, the demonization
of traditional spirituality, identity and role confusion, experiences of World War
II atrocities, and historical and ongoing colonialism. Pier (1998) investigated the
intergenerational transmission of historic community trauma affecting CHamorus
and indicates that such experiences pose mental health concerns. In an unsettling
parallel, Braveheart et al. (2011) report that the prevalence of serious psychiatric
disorders among American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations is
rooted in the experience of collective, communal, and generational trauma that
manifests today as racism, oppression, and discrimination. Having a mental health
diagnosis is a confounding variable for family violence, and such dynamics are
prevalent in Indigenous populations in the Marianas, as they are for Indigenous
populations around the world.

Traditional CHamoru Concepts of the Family (I Manggåfa)
While CHamorus continue to endure colonization today, many traditional values
remain intact, including the value of i manggåfa (the family system). In present times,
i manggåfa continues to play a critical role in the lives of CHamorus and remains the
foundation of society. Consequently, traditional concepts of i manggåfa provide a
framework for understanding contemporary familial dynamics, particularly those
of family violence. The CHamoru creation account describes how humanity was
born out of Fouha Rock in Humåtak (Umatac), as fashioned by the primordial
brother and sister, Pontan and Fo'na. The cross-sibling relationship in the account

speaks to CHamorus’ value of familial relationships and the brother-sister pair as
the “basic building block” of matrilineal societies found throughout Micronesia
(Marshall, 1981). According to Underwood (1992),
     The family, in its various manifestations throughout Micronesia is the unit that
     traditionally has kept the society intact, responsive, and responsible in the face
     of change. Micronesians, by an overwhelming majority, see families as the basic
     building blocks of society; moreover, they tend to see each other not as indi-
     viduals with particular professions or personalities, but as people from certain
     families. This family orientation is healthy and necessary for their continued
     survival as Micronesians, for it is in the family context that most serious discus-
     sions occur and most decisions are made. (p. 169)
With the extensive history of colonization of the Mariana Islands by the Spanish
for over two centuries, the common reference for “family” used in the CHamoru
language is the adopted Spanish word, familia. As the global community has slowly
shifted to embrace indigeneity, CHamorus have further embarked upon the pro-
cesses of political and personal decolonization. As part of the latter, there has been
great emphasis on reclaiming more authentic, Indigenous, and decolonized con-
cepts of culture and language, including the use of archaic terms in the CHamoru
language, also referred to as Fino' Håya, “one of an estimated 1,200 languages in the
Austronesian language family that originated out of Taiwan more than 5,000 years
ago” (Lynch, 1998). Fino' Håya uses Indigenous and pre-colonial words that were
not introduced by the island’s colonizers—more specifically, the Spanish, Germans,
Japanese, or Americans. Hence, in exploring CHamoru concepts of manggåfa, it is
critical to examine the Fino' Håya references to family.

Early accounts of CHamorus and the role of the family have been documented by a
number of foreign observers, including Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora and Louis Claude
de Freycinet. Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora was a priest who lived in the Marianas
for about 7 months in 1602. Louis Claude de Freycinet was a French navigator who
visited the Mariana Islands as part of a Pacific expedition in the early 1800s. Each of
these men wrote extensive accounts of their observations of the CHamoru culture
and other aspects of living in the Marianas. Similarly, Russell (1998) describes an-
cient CHamoru culture as reported by early foreign accounts of the Marianas.
Freycinet (2003) revealed a number of word references to the concept of family for
CHamorus. He noted that CHamorus referred to family as manggåfa and one’s blood
relatives as atchafgnang, who were obliged to carry out familial duties. In addition,
he defined atchagma as those who were related by friendship and who were assigned
specific duties. He also described atugtcha-guma as those who had family relations
through a specific connection or obligation, as in the case of someone who saved
the life of one’s child. The atugcha-guma was typically given a guneha famaguan
(guinahan famagu'on) or turtle shell necklace pendant with drilled holes in it to
represent each of one’s children. This custom is consistent with CHamoru reciproci-
ty practices and is an effort to make empas, or even, for the debt of saving the child’s
life. Freycinet also described children who were pinigsai (pineksai)—adopted into
the family and regarded as biological children entrusted to the care and protection
of the women. He also reported that relationships were closest with the mother’s
side of the family system and that women’s requests were obliged over those of men.

Gender Roles and Marriage
Consistent with CHamorus’ matrilineal, matriarchal, and matricentric organization
of society, women were noted as having a prominent role in the clan—particularly
evident in the maga'håga or female chief. The role of the maga'håga complemented
the role of the maga'låhi or male chief and together they managed affairs as the
highest-ranking male and female in the clan. Women were traditionally responsi-
ble for managing the affairs of the house, raising the children, fishing inside of the
reef, food preparation, weaving, and making pottery. Men, on the other hand, were
the navigators, fishermen outside of the reef, and tool makers. Nonetheless, there
existed a complementary relationship between them. According to Mendiola (2019),
“Chamorros were able to find a societal equilibrium as both men and women—the
eldest brother and sister—were co-equal guardians and administrators of clans and
their resources” (para. 3). The status of men and women in CHamoru society was
historically one of complementarity, giving respect and responsibilities to each in
different spheres of communal life. Hence, men and women functioned on equal
planes, rather than one holding a position of power over the other. Rather, both as-
sumed complementary roles in society and were equally respected and revered for
their contributions. This egalitarian relationship is nicely articulated in the creation
account with brother-sister gods Pontan and Fo'na.

Freycinet (2003) described the role of CHamoru women as having “the direction of
public affairs … in their hands. At home, they were absolute mistresses and had the
command of everything; nothing was done without first obtaining their opinion or
consent” (p. 183). Russell (1998) added that
    It is clear from these accounts that while the men may have been the warriors
    and navigators, the women were the heads of household and were quick to
    assert their prerogatives. For instance, the husband did not dare give an order
    contrary to [his wife’s] wishes, nor punish the children, for she [would] turn
    upon him and beat him. (p. 150)
These two accounts highlight CHamoru women’s significant role in the household
and in affairs concerning the children. One reason given for the prominent role of
women is their sacred ability to carry and bear children.

Women clearly assumed the role of household heads, inclusive of decision-making
and parenting. Souder (as cited in Russell, 1998) underscores these functions, and
references the active role of women in matters of familial inheritance:
     Females—particularly elder women in the clan, who were married and moth-
     ers—were powerful in all spheres of … society. Through [the] matrilineal
     kinship system, women exercised control over family life, property, and inheri-
     tance. They assumed a central role and possessed strong bargaining powers in
     their marriage … Their esteemed status was also reflected in rituals, legends,
     and ceremonial events. (p. 150)

Although women were highly respected and regarded for their ability to bear chil-
dren and for their role as traditional owners of clan land, men were not subordinate
or secondary to them. Describing the honoring accorded to fathers, Freycinet (2003)
observed that when a child of status was born, rice was thrown at the feet of the
father as a sign of respect. Children’s names were also based on the skills of their fa-
thers, as in the case of Nineti (ingenious) and Tai-agnao (intrepid). These examples
highlight the complementarity of the relationship between men and women, as well
as the respect given to fathers of the clan.

The importance of manggåfa is reiterated when examining traditional CHamoru
practices relative to marriage. Freycinet (2003) specifically addressed the sanctity of
the union of marriage and described the consequences of marital infidelity:
    An adulterous woman, who had been repudiated by her husband and sent back
    to her mother’s house after judgment, was stripped of her possessions at the
    same time … But he was perfectly free to avenge himself upon the seducer for
    the insult received, even to the point of killing him. (p. 183)
Likewise, when women were upset with their spouses, they were able to respond, as
Freycinet (2003) observed:
    All the women kept it, a spear in their hand and their husband’s hat on their
    head. In that marital guise, they then advance as a unit on the house of the
    guilty man. First, they lay waste his crops and tear up his cereals, trampling
    them down, then they strip his fruit trees of their fruit and create an appalling
    mess. Finally, they descend upon the dwelling itself, and if the wretched hus-
    band has not taken precaution of betaking himself elsewhere and finding cover,
    they attack him too, and chase him right out. (p. 183)
Each of these accounts by Freycinet indicate responses that, in extreme cases, led
to physical violence: in the former, towards the third-party male having an affair
with one’s wife, and in the latter, towards one’s husband. Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora
reported similar reactions to infidelity:
    when a man and a woman marry and live together in a house, although they
    have been married twenty or thirty years, if the husband is unfaithful to his
    wife, or takes a mistress, and if it should anger his wife, she will leave the house,
    taking the children and all the household furniture and effects, and will go to
    the house of her parents or of other relatives, where she will remain. During all
    this time, the children will not acknowledge their father, even though he may
    pass very close to them. Before the wife will return to the husband, his relatives
    will have to go to great lengths to do so. If the wife is unfaithful to the husband,
    her relatives do not have to go to such lengths because it is easier to obtain the
    husband’s pardon since this sin is considered less serious for the women than
    for the men. (Driver, 1989, p. 21)
Clearly, the marital relationship entailed a relationship between a man and a woman,
but also a relationship between two clans and the conjugation of their resources.

In a matrilineal society, land is transmitted along the maternal line, giving women
great power in society. Consistent with practices throughout the Pacific, land own-
ership represented wealth for CHamoru women. This dynamic, coupled with the
ability to bear children, gave CHamoru women prominence and special standing

in society. Perhaps this explains the privilege afforded women that is referenced in
these historical accounts.

In contemporary times, however, the introduction of patriarchal values through the
Catholic Church and Westernization has begun a shift from an egalitarian system to
one with the male as the head of household, principal decision maker, and holder of
the resources. Land, for example, is more likely today to be passed on to sons so that
they may be able to take care of their families, a practice that was introduced during
the Spanish colonial period. The introduction of patriarchy has placed a strain on
CHamoru families, as males assert a non-traditional role at the helm of families and
attempt to disempower women and reduce their status in the family. This dynamic
has proven problematic and is a key factor leading to role confusion, thereby in-
creasing the potential for intimate partner violence.

Parenting and the Role of Children
Children hold a position of great importance within the CHamoru manggåfa.
Consistent with agrarian societies, CHamoru families were traditionally large.
Similar to other Micronesian societies, children were viewed as resources and
wealth. While both parents bore the responsibilities of parenting the children, chil-
dren were clearly viewed as belonging to the mother and her clan.

Juan Pobre described the very beautiful role prescribed to children and the great
love that accompanied parenting as follows:
     While they are very young, they make their sons and daughters work and teach
     them to perform their tasks. Consequently, the very young know how to per-
     form their tasks like their parents because they have been taught with great love.
     So great is their love for their children that it would take a long time to describe
     it and to sing it praises. They never spank them, and they even scold them with
     loving words. When a child is offended and angered by what is said to him, he
     will move a short distance away from his parents and turn his back to them, not
     wanting to face them. They will then toss sand or pebbles on the ground behind
     him and after he has cried for a little while, one of his parents will go to him and,
     with very tender words, will take him in his arms or raise him to his shoulders
     and carry him back to where the others are gathered. Then they will always give
     him some of their best food and speaking to them as if he were an adult, tell him
     how he should behave, admonishing him to be good. With such great love, these
     barbarians raise their children, that they, in turn, grow up to be obedient and
     expert in their occupations and skills. (Driver, 1989, p.17)
This historical account of CHamoru childrearing practices describes a very loving
approach that can serve as a source of empowerment for parents today as they learn
to improve their parenting skills.

Parents were tasked with socializing their same-gendered children into their respec-
tive gender roles. Fathers were noted to be central figures in the lives of their sons.
Juan Pobre observed:
     At the age of four or five, they teach their sons to go out to sea in little boats
     that they build for them, and which have their own outriggers that are iden-
     tical to those on their fathers’ larger boats. By the age of fourteen, they have
     come so skilled at using them, that the sons know as much as their fathers; by
     the time they are sixteen or eighteen, the sons put out to sea to fish alone, as
     I have seen them do. Alone in his funei, he sets the sails, bails the boat, and
     fishes with a hook and net; if it capsizes, he rights it, so great is their strength.
     (Driver, 1989, p. 15)
This account demonstrates the active role that fathers played in socializing their sons
in their culturally prescribed gender roles. Similarly, mothers too were responsible
for teaching their daughters how to carry out their duties in the service of the clan.

The propensity for child abuse and neglect in contemporary society seems incon-
sistent with Juan Pobre’s accounts of how lovingly CHamorus treated their children.
This raises the question of what accounts for the incidence of child abuse in contem-
porary times. Colonialism in the past and present has placed pressure on CHamorus
to adapt to the new world order of westernization. Parents experience high levels of
stress as a result of being ill-prepared for the demands of life. Confounding factors
such as substance use disorders, land dispossession, poverty, limited educational
attainment, and youthful parenting present additional challenges and increase the
propensity for the abuse of CHamoru children today.

I Manåmko' (Elderly)/Mañaina (Parents/Parental Figures)
The elderly, or manåmko', have historically been, and continue to be valued and
key members in i manggåfa for CHamorus. Contemporary CHamorus also refer to

the elderly as mañaina or parents/parental figures. Mañaina are revered for their
wisdom and knowledge as teachers and decision makers of the clan.

Mañaina are the cultural knowledge bearers for traditions, family history, the
CHamoru language, genealogy, and inafa'maolek (collective peace). Their permis-
sion is sought when a young couple intends to marry. The immense respect afforded
mañaina is encapsulated in the custom of mannginge' or the practice of sniffing the
hand of elders so as in to inhale their spirit and wisdom. In return, the practitioner
receives a blessing from the parental figure.

Historical accounts on the role of mañaina are far and few, but Marsh (2018) states,
    One of the first things written about CHamoru society was that manåmko
    (elders) were highly respected and held a lot of power. An early Spanish visitor
    to Guam, Fray Antonio de los Angeles, in 1596 said the elders gave orders and
    everyone obeyed them—completely. It was family elders who ruled their clans
    and thus ancient CHamoru society. (para. 2)
This prominent role of elders continues today with the eldest members of the clan
receiving special privileges and care. Typically, elderly parents are cared for by the
eldest daughter in the clan from the home. While Guahån has a senior care home,
the CNMI does not. For most CHamoru families, the inability to care for elders in
the home until their death is internalized as a failure on their part.

The cultural practice of caring for elders until their death is inconsistent with the
high rates of elder abuse by CHamorus in the Marianas. It is noteworthy to mention
that the most frequently reported form of elder abuse in Guahån is financial/prop-
erty and in the CNMI is fraud (financial exploitation and scams).

In attempting to understand this phenomenon, the interconnectedness between the
cultural practice of caring for the elderly in the home until death and the limited
coping and resources in the home should be considered and contextualized through
the lens of colonization. Traditional CHamoru practices treated the individual as
a small part of the larger collective society. Hence, value was placed on the needs
of the collective before the individual. When this worldview is applied to contem-
porary practices, the use of the elderly’s financial resources and assets can be seen
as a contribution to meeting the needs of the collective household. This sharing
of resources becomes necessary in the context of colonization wherein the family
system experiences extreme stress and is unable to meet the demands of daily living.
While through a Western lens these acts are deemed illegal and in violation of the
elder’s rights, a traditional cultural perspective could view it as an extension of the
care that the elders have consistently contributed to the family system in the past.

Implications for Social Service Practitioners
Indigenous peoples’ experiences of historical trauma warrant the integration of cul-
ture-based interventions to facilitate healing from family violence (Braveheart et al.,
2011; Fast & Collin-Vezina, 2010; Gurm, 2020; Klingspohn, 2018; Pihama et al., 2019;
Vickers & Moyer, 2020). Given the dismal reality of family violence experiences for
many CHamoru families, it is strategic for social service providers to integrate tradi-
tional conceptualizations of i manggåfa into their provision of services in an effort to
provide services that are culturally competent and reflective of cultural safety.

According to the National Association of Social Workers (2015) Standards and
Indicators for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice, “Cultural competence
requires self-awareness, cultural humility, and the commitment to understanding
and embracing culture as central to effective practice” (p. 6). Self-awareness requires
self-reflection and taking personal inventory of one’s beliefs, prejudices, and biases
that exist against persons from diverse backgrounds. Becoming aware of these be-
liefs is necessary to be able to sensitize themselves when working with CHamoru
families. Further, seeking a deeper understanding of CHamoru values, beliefs,
cultural practices, and history will allow one to develop a more deeply rooted un-
derstanding of behaviors. This deeper understanding will allow the practitioner to
exercise empathy and avoid negative judgement.

Cultural humility is another consistently recommended approach for working with
Indigenous peoples. Cultural humility positions the practitioner as an observer and
learner to ensure alignment with the client’s traditional beliefs, values, and worl-
dview. This practice places the client at the center and as the expert of his or her
life. Cultural humility acknowledges that the practitioner is merely a resource for
change to the client system, presenting clients with options, information, and skills
that complement their own and make cultural sense. Cultural humility also makes

certain that the options presented to clients flow logically and are rooted in tradi-
tional knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs.

Coupled with cultural competency and cultural humility, cultural safety is defined
as “an environment that is spiritually, socially, emotionally and physically safe for
people; where cultural identity is recognized and valued through shared respect,
meaning, knowledge and the experience of learning together” (Klingspohn, 2018,
p. 3). Social service delivery systems should prioritize creating an environment of
cultural safety to rebuild trust and confidence in the system. This effort to validate
the lived experiences of clients and to meet them in the context of their cultural
selves becomes fertile ground for healing and transformation.

Gurm (2020) provides a framework for culturally competent services to draw from
Indigenous knowledge systems, incorporate Indigenous practitioners and elders,
repair the fragmented Indigenous identity, and incorporate a connection to spirit
and spirituality. Further, the values of respect, wisdom, responsibility, and rela-
tionships should all be modeled. Lastly, Gurm (2020) suggests the incorporation of
storytelling to facilitate healing when addressing trauma and griefwork, as this is a
traditional approach consistently employed by Indigenous peoples.

Social service organizations and agencies play an essential role in setting the stan-
dard for culturally competent practice. Pihama et al. (2019) share the approach when
developing services for Indigenous Māori from Aotearoa (New Zealand): “Healing
must take place on both individual and collective levels to prevent intergenerational
transmission of trauma” (p. 1). They further highlight the importance of building
services on the Māori cultural and healing paradigms that have eroded as a result
of the colonial experience. Lastly, they emphasize the need for services to be devel-
oped and implemented by Indigenous peoples for Indigenous peoples. Similarly,
Klingspohn (2018) emphasizes the need for the integration of Indigenous ceremo-
nies, language, and traditions into family group counseling. More specifically, First
Nation ceremonies such as smudging, the talking circle, and the sweat lodge for
Aboriginal men have been effectively incorporated into programs.

Agency policies have the opportunity to shift from traditional approaches to
ones that meet the nuanced needs of CHamoru client systems. For example, the
employment of personnel whose identities reflect the demographic composition of
clients is a key strategy. This effort reaffirms the need to learn about CHamoru cul-
ture. Further, when clients are able to see themselves in social service practitioners,
they typically feel safer and more comfortable. This culturally competent approach
is reassuring to clients—particularly when they have engaged in services that have
left them feeling frustrated, disenfranchised, and underserved in the past.

In addition, a social service agency’s effort towards language access and proficiency
for limited English speakers is necessary. For clients who feel more comfortable
speaking in the CHamoru language, working with personnel with fluency in the
language facilitates the client engagement process more efficiently and with greater
depth. Access to language speakers, translated materials (especially consent forms),
and marketing materials in the Native language are efforts that can facilitate trust
with potential clients. The late Senator Angel Leon Guerrero Santos, Indigenous
rights defender from Guahån, consistently referenced the Indigenous language as
the voice of the Indigenous soul. It is from this level of spirit that healing is facilitated.

Another strategy that agencies can employ is some mechanism for consultation with
the mañaina. This is consistent with the primary role mañaina play in CHamoru
society in the past and in the present. This can take multiple forms, including a
seat on its governing body or board, the creation of a mañaina advisory council, or
the hiring of mañaina to play a visible and active role in the delivery of culturally
competent interventions to agency client systems—such as utilizing mañaina as a
resource in family therapy sessions because their words are highly regarded and
respected. Mañaina can also share life lessons through storytelling. Their recom-
mendations and feedback can be solicited in the design and development of new
programs as a check for potential efficacy by evaluating the proposed program’s cul-
tural alignment. In this case, the influence of the mañaina in the cultural worldview
of CHamorus is replicated in the service delivery system.

Similarly, acknowledging ancestors as part of agency protocols serves as another
source of empowerment for CHamoru clients. Like other cultures in the Asia-Pacific
region, CHamorus traditionally venerated their ancestors. In ancient times, skulls of
ancestors or maranan uchan were kept in their homes as an extension of their inclu-
sion of the deceased in the family. CHamorus are highly relational and contextualize

other CHamorus through their clan identifications. Upon meeting each other, one
usually asks, “What’s your last name? What village are you from? Who are your
parents?” This is usually followed by asking their relation to notable members of the
person’s clan. Given this cultural practice, agencies could mirror this protocol as part
of engaging new clients. For example, a private, behavioral health clinic in Guahån
dedicated a table to the display of their personnel’s ancestors who have died. As part
of client engagement, clients were introduced to the provider’s clan by sharing the
pictures and likewise, clients were given the opportunity to share their lineage. This
allows for a deeper sense of connection with social service practitioners.

In specifically examining curriculum content and interventions for working with
clients, Duran and Duran (1995) emphasize the need for individual counselors work-
ing with Indigenous peoples to shift away from a Eurocentric worldview to embrace
one that is consistent with Indigenous beliefs. This includes the reframing of con-
ceptualizations of healing and mental health. The process of unlearning Western
treatment models taught in mainstream counseling programs becomes necessary
to increase efficacy when working with Indigenous populations. This shift is an ini-
tial step towards effectively addressing issues of family violence in the counseling
process. An example of this entails placing the focus of treatment in the context of
the total family system. This reinforces the development of a strong family group
counseling component in services, as opposed to focusing solely on the individual.
Practices such as this are associated with the collective values of CHamorus.

Family violence interventions should intentionally incorporate components to
decolonize CHamorus’ identities and maladaptive coping mechanisms that contra-
dict the very essence of traditional practices. This entails the reeducation process
of traditional gender roles, parenting accounts, and the value of the elderly. For
example, the development of training curricula that specifically teach CHamorus
the traditional value assigned to women will empower them from the context of
their cultural identity and re-instill in them a sense of their maga'håga (female
chief ) qualities. Nonetheless, emphasis should be given to the complementarity in
the relationship between women and men in the provision of services and not the
domination of one over the other. In addition, notions of toxic masculinity should
also be dispelled and rejected as cultural practice.

In an effort to specifically address child abuse, the parenting account described by
Juan Pobre can serve as a reference point for parenting skills training and helping
CHamorus to decolonize their parenting roles when engaging their children. The
account specifically presents parenting strategies such as timeout, role modeling, and
the use of praise. These parenting strategies have been found to be universally effec-
tive today and are taught in parenting curricula in the social service field. Hence, these
strategies should be incorporated into parenting classes because they are consistent
with historical accounts of traditional parenting styles and will serve to empower
parents by connecting them with practices that reflect their Indigenous identities.

Social service interventions could also analyze traditional CHamoru chants, legends,
or proverbs delivered through storytelling. For example, chants in the CHamoru
language connect clients and help to give voice and expression to the Indigenous
spirit. Chants were traditionally used ritualistically during funerals and special life
rites. They tell the stories of our ancestors and traditional ways of life. While the use
of chants was not so visible during the Spanish colonial period, a revitalization of
chanting has occurred in more recent history and chants are especially used to bless
events and to invite ancestors to be present.

Just as the use of traditional chants can serve as an intervention for working with
CHamoru clients, so too can the use of traditional legends. The CHamoru legend
of Taga is highly illustrative of family violence. Here’s the Farrell (2019) ren-
dition of the legend:
     According to CHamoru legend, Taga was born to the maga'låhi or chief of
     Ritidian Village, Guam. In the legend, Taga was a giant. Dissatisfied with his fa-
     ther’s rule, the boy challenged his father to a fight. When Taga lost the fight, he
     moved to Rota, where he challenged the leading maga'låhi to a series of contests.
     Winning these contests, he married a local CHamoru woman and had a daugh-
     ter. At As Nieves, Rota, he began excavating what would have been the largest
     latte stones in the Marianas – perhaps he was trying to impress his father. For
     an unknown reason, however, Taga moved from Rota to Tinian without lifting
     the stones out of the ground. As he had on Rota, the giant Taga gained power in
     Tinian and had a son. He then oversaw the construction of his home, the House
     of Taga, on Sanhalom Bay on the southwest coast of the island. The house con-
     sisted of 12 latte stones, with a wooden house built on top of the stones. When

     the son of Taga turned five years old, Taga gave him a giant ayuyu (coconut crab)
     as a present. Unfortunately, while the boy was walking the crab, it cut the twine
     leash and ran under a young coconut tree. The boy ran back to Taga House
     and asked his father to push over the coconut tree so he could get the crab.
     Taga refused, explaining that the coconuts were just beginning to bear fruit.
     The boy became furious. He ran back to the tree and shook it furiously, finally
     pushing over the tree himself. While the boy was pulling the crab from the hole
     he had just created, he noticed water. It was fresh water. He gave the well to his
     half-sister for her to bathe in. When Taga saw his young son perform this great
     feat of strength, he recognized that the boy might become bigger and stronger
     than even himself. He remembered fighting his own father. That night, Taga
     crept into the boy’s room and smothered him to death. Taga’s daughter saw this.
     She became so frightened, she ran away to the deep forest and hid. By the time
     she was returned to her mother, the girl was so weak that she died. Taga buried
     the girl in a cavity dug in one of the tasa of Taga House. This grieved the mother
     so much, she too died. This left Taga, the biggest and strongest of all CHamoru
     maga'låhi, shamed. (para. 2–5)
An in-depth analysis of the legend could discuss the impact of family violence on
the Taga family system. Specific questions could explore the following: How does
intergenerational paternal conflict and violence affect generations to come? How
does the perpetrator of hyper-masculine violence feel as a result of his or her ac-
tions? How does the emotion of anger play a role in violence? How does fear impact
our relationship with others? Do anger and power justify the loss of life? To what
extent do you think Taga experienced regret as a result of killing his son? How do
you think Taga’s grief impacted his life with the loss of his son, daughter, and wife
as a result of jealousy and the need to maintain power? How does the experience
of shame affect our future behavior? What alternatives to violence could Taga have
used to address his feelings of discontent? The use of CHamoru legends provides
a relatable reference point for examining the consequences of family violence and
helps to empower clients by reconnecting them with traditional stories reflective
of their personal identities and by promoting the CHamoru value of inafa'maolek
(collective peace).

A final recommendation for social service providers is to have family members affirm
their commitment to refrain from engaging in family violence and alternatively
to make a pledge to uphold inafa'maolek in their homes and lives. The following
pledge is an adaptation from de La Cruz and Natividad’s (2017) curriculum for teach-
ing personal well-being:

Inafa'moalek (Collective Peace) Family Pledge
The following pledge is adapted from Navigating Personal Well-being and Sexuality: A
Facilitator’s Guide for Working with Chuukese and CHamoru Communities, by T. de La
Cruz & L. Natividad (2017):
     Because I love my manggåfa and want only the best for them, I promise to always
     center inafa'maolek in our home. I vow to be peaceful and to listen to others. I
     will tell them how I feel and not let my anger be a reason to hurt or harm them.
     I will respect how they feel and try to understand them. I will use my hands
     only for loving and not for hurting. I will use my words only for saying things
     to make my family feel good about themselves and I will not say hurtful things.
     With the guidance of our ancestors, I promise to do the following to practice
     inafa'maolek in my home:
     1.
     2.
     3.
     I make this vow in the spirit of inafa'maolek and guinaiya (love).
This degree of integration of cultural proficiency in family violence prevention and
treatment programs aims to improve outcomes for CHamoru client systems.

Conclusion
This chapter explored the intersectionality of family violence, historical trauma, and
CHamoru families living in the Mariana Islands. It introduced the framework of his-
torical trauma and examined traditional concepts of i manggåfa (the family system)
as presented in historical accounts, specifically examining the role of gender, the
marital relationship, and CHamoru parenting practices. As CHamorus struggle with
deconstructing their colonized world, it is strategic to employ the use of historical
references to traditional practices as a means of decolonizing their experience and
to develop culturally proficient social services. This chapter also offered suggestions
for social service practitioners in developing culturally proficient intervention strat-
egies for working with CHamoru families who have experienced family violence. It
is from this cultural vantage point that CHamorus will reclaim their personal power
and live inafa'maolek (community peace).

Ti Siña Ma Funas Ham: Shapes of CHamoru Erasure in Guam (Kenneth Gofigan Kuper)

Driving around Guam, one is likely to see “TANO Y CHAMORRO”²⁰ printed on the
bottom half of our license plates. Translated as “Land of the CHamoru,” this phrase
serves as a reminder that Guam (as part of the Marianas Archipelago) is the home-
land of the CHamoru people. Guam is CHamoru land, and this is an unchangeable
fact. Yet, this does not deter some from conjuring the dark magic of trying to change
what should be unchangeable. In March 2017, District Court of Guam Judge Francis
Tydingco-Gatewood ruled in favor of plaintiff Arnold “Dave” Davis in Davis v. Guam:
     Davis sued the government of Guam in federal court in hopes of overturning
     the Guam law limiting the electorate in any future self-determination plebi-
     scite to those falling within the statutory definition of a “native inhabitant of
     Guam,” or those persons who became US citizens by virtue of the passage in
     Congress of the 1950 Organic Act of Guam (and descendants of those persons).
     (Aguon, 2014, p. 282)

Gatewood ruled in favor of Davis: “Having found that the classification is racial, this
court finds that the Plebiscite statute impermissibly imposed race-based restrictions
on the voting rights of non-Native inhabitants of Guam, in violation of the Fifteenth
Amendment” (Davis v. Guam, 2017). The Government of Guam would appeal this
ruling and after the US Supreme Court denied hearing the case, the Government
of Guam officially exhausted local and national remedies. Thus, Davis v. Guam
stands.²¹ This ruling demonstrates friction between the colonial US legal system
and genuine CHamoru self-determination in Guam when it comes to the political
status plebiscite. This case is but one example, I argue, of the unjust treatment of
CHamorus as the Indigenous people of the island being erased in favor of a “one
amongst many” discourse, or what Kanaka Maoli scholar, Kehaulani Kauanui,
(2008) calls “colonialism through equality.”

In this chapter, I argue that this logic of erasure is not confined to this example; I
use settler colonial theory to elucidate the ways CHamoru erasure can be found in
various shapes in Guam. Tracking these shapes is an important and necessary task
to help prevent further instances of CHamoru erasure, whether planned or not. I
trace these shapes of erasure in Guam from physical militarization to settler colonial
logics and discourses enforced by American legal institutions. I am inspired by Dine
scholar Glen Coulthard (2014), who argues that in order to maintain its dominance
temporally and spatially, colonial power has shape-shifted from being primarily ex-
clusive and assimilationist in structure to more accommodating and engaging. Yet,
it is still colonial in its foundation. Thus, I aim to dissect the anatomy of CHamoru
erasure with an eye towards understanding the physiology of how these seemingly
disparate anatomical parts coalesce to pump the blood of erasure in Guam today.

To accomplish that goal, this chapter is divided into four parts. In the first section,
I introduce Guam and engage with settler colonial theory to situate my usage of
erasure and show that despite not meeting the typical characteristics of settler co-
lonialism, the logics of settler colonialism still operate in Guam today and can be a
useful analytic. The second section then traces the physical history of “destroying
and replacing” during and after World War II, which helped create the conditions
of possibility for further CHamoru erasure today. I argue that this material trans-
formation of the island set the stage for other forms of erasure. The third section
then demonstrates the discursive operationalization of this process of erasure in the
present day through the imposition of settler colonial logics, particularly a disguised
form of multiculturalism. In this section, I also further explore the legal shape of
CHamoru erasure via the lawfare of individual rights to hinder the CHamoru push
for self-determination. The final section then outlines paths forward for CHamoru
and non-CHamoru relationships that are not predicated on erasure.

Guam and Settler Colonialism
At present, Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Due
to this political status, the people of Guam, most being citizens of the United States,
have no voting representation in the US House of Representatives, no representation
in the US Senate, and no votes in the Electoral College, which elects the President
of the United States. Furthermore, as an unincorporated territory, Guam falls under
the plenary power or “full and complete legislative authority” of Congress as a result
of Article IV, Section III, Clause II of the United States Constitution, also known as
the Territorial Clause (Sparrow, 2006). Per the Insular Cases, Guam is considered
“foreign in a domestic sense” to the American polity (Downes v. Bidwell, 1901). As
former Governor of Guam, Joseph Ada (1989), wrote, “Guam is governed exclusively
under rules designed at the height of imperial fever, at a time when some legal fic-
tion was needed to justify the maintenance of war booty, to justify the rule of people
in a condition similar to serfdom.”

Demographically, as of 2010, Guam had a population of 159,358 people with indige-
nous CHamorus comprising only 37.1% of the total population (US Census Bureau,
2010). Intertwined with this political status and demographic situation, the island
is also heavily militarized. The US military currently occupies roughly 27% of the
island, which is a mere 32 miles long and 12 miles wide. There is a large air force
base in the north (Andersen Air Force Base), a navy base in the south (Naval Base
Guam), the continuing development of a new Marine Corps installation, a THAAD
anti-missile defense system, and a naval ordnance annex all located on the island.
Guam currently serves as a critical piece in US strategy and power-projection in
the Indo-Pacific. Guam’s role in maintaining American preponderance in this region
has remained constant, and this is important to understand not only Guam’s place in
the world, but also CHamoru erasure. It is the entanglement of Guam’s geographical
location and political status that serves as the primary reason for US presence in the
island. To put it another way, this is the key to erasure.

At first glance, Guam might not seem a good fit for settler colonial analysis. I argue
that although not being a “textbook” settler colony, settler colonial theory helps to
explain the processes of erasure accompanying political colonization and militariza-
tion. Settler colonialism refers to a “historically created system of power that aims to
expropriate Indigenous territories and eliminate modes of production in order to re-
place Indigenous peoples with settlers who are discursively constituted as superior
and thus more deserving over these contested lands and resources” (Saranillo, 2015,
p. 284). In his article, “Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native,” Patrick
Wolfe (2006) argues that territoriality is the driving force of settler colonialism and
that “settler society required the practical elimination of the Natives in order to es-
tablish itself on their territory” (p. 389), thus making settler colonialism inherently
eliminatory. Wolfe (2006) dubs this the “logic of elimination.” Unlike traditional
colonies, labor is not necessarily key in settler colonialism, land is. When looking
at settler colonies around the world such as Hawai‘i, Australia, the United States,
or Canada, Guam has glaring differences. Unlike the situation of Indigenous peo-
ples in the aforementioned examples, CHamorus still make up the largest portion
of the population (even if only 37%) and still control the mechanisms of political
power at the local territorial level. At the time of writing in 2021, CHamorus make
up a majority of the senators in the Guam Legislature, comprise a majority of the
Guam Supreme and Superior Court, and serve in the highest positions of the Guam
Executive Branch, including the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and most cabinet
positions. Thus, one could argue that CHamorus have not been eliminated.

However, settler colonialism as an analytic is still relevant. As described by Lorenzo
Veracini, “settler colonialism as paradigm emphasized circumstances primarily
characterized by a determination to erase colonized subjectivities rather than re-
produce their subordination” (Cavanagh & Veracini, 2017, p. 3). Furthermore, “The
scholars contributing to settler colonial studies have emphasized the continuing
operation of an unchanged set of unequal relations. Settler colonialism as a mode
of domination, it was often noted, has typically resisted formal decolonization”
(Cavanagh & Veracini, 2017, p. 3). Core characteristics of settler colonialism make it
relevant to understanding the shape of colonialism in Guam today, such as the drive
for territoriality and land, the continued operation of an unchanged set of unequal
relations, and a determination to erase colonized subjectivities.

Destroy and Replace
The nature of the United States’ relationship to Guam has been evident almost
since the moment the former obtained the latter as a spoil of the Spanish-American
War in 1898. The US military would subsequently establish a naval presence on the
island, thus beginning the drive for territoriality and land that in part characterizes
the dynamics of its settler colonialism in the region. During this period, the island
was used as a coaling station with the highest-ranking naval officer serving as the
governor of the island. Alfred Thayer Mahan, who served as president of the Naval
War College, emphasized the importance of a strong naval capability if the United
States wanted to scramble for the world’s wealth. Mahan (2004) argued that per-
manent naval bases and coaling stations were crucial to safeguarding the national
security of the United States and urged the country to shape a “healthy regional
balance of power through forward basing, a strong navy and alignment among the
maritime powers” (p. 3). In line with Mahan’s strategic thinking, Guam was used as
both a coaling station and a naval possession of the US military. While the United
States would utilize Guam as a naval possession from 1899 to 1941, World War II and
its aftermath served as a turning point in Guam’s transformation. I argue that the
physical destruction of the island, taking of CHamoru land, and subsequent emi-
gration and immigration constitute three elements of material erasure after the war.

On December 8, 1941, the Japanese bombed Guam just 4 hours after they bombed
Pearl Harbor in Oʻahu. From December 1941 to July 1944, CHamorus suffered under
brutal Japanese occupation that involved intense manual labor, rapes, beheadings,
and massacres. In 1944, 3 years into the Japanese occupation, the United States
returned to the island, eventually defeating the Japanese and re-establishing con-
trol over the island. This reoccupation and its subsequent consequences helped
physically transform the island into its current status as a giant military base. As
part of the US plan to retake the island from the Japanese, they engaged in heavy
bombardment. As a result of this approach and the wider conflict, about 80% of
the island’s permanent structures were destroyed and the capital of Hagåtña was
nearly completely bombarded into concrete rubble (Political Status Education
Coordinating Commission, 1994). According to Guam historian Pedro Sanchez
(1988), “Not a single dwelling remained in Asan, Piti, Agat, and Sumay, the pre-war
hometowns of over 4,000 Chamorros” (p. 254).

During the remainder of the war and during the reconstruction of the island there-
after, the military engaged in rampant land takings. By 1946, over 200,000 military
personnel were stationed in Guam, with only one-third of the land remaining in
CHamoru hands. By 1947, 1,350 families had lost their lands to the military, with
11,000 of the 20,000 inhabitants in Hagåtña and Sumay alone being displaced and
relocated. While CHamorus were not completely resistant to land being “tempo-
rarily” taken by the military for bases to finish the war, what angered them was
the military taking of land for the construction of recreational facilities. As Anne
Perez Hattori (2001) writes, “In Agaña, roughly five hundred people were displaced
when eighty-two lots were condemned for a park and in Tamuning, sixty hectares of
Tumon Beach were condemned for a military recreational center” (p. 190).

The war and these land takings did not just lead to the dispossession of CHamorus
from their land, but also led to non-CHamorus becoming a majority of the popu-
lation in two ways: CHamoru emigration and non-CHamoru immigration. With a
significant amount of the land bombarded during the war, the prevalent pre-war
CHamoru subsistence lifestyle was nearly impossible. In 1940, there were an esti-
mated 2,747 CHamoru farmers in Guam, with the number dropping to a mere 311 by
1960 (del Valle, 1979). This violent interruption of CHamoru sustainability led many
CHamorus to move to the United States for higher education, economic opportunities,
and military service (Untalan, 2015). Furthermore, another impetus for emigration
was the lifting of Guam’ security clearance in 1962 along with the development of a
tourism industry and the subsequent spike in CHamoru land sales as the commer-
cial real estate market boomed. According to the decennial census there were 30,695
CHamorus in the United States in 1980, 49,345 in 1990, and around 97,000 in 2010.
This continuous exodus reinforces Patrick Wolfe’s (2006) argument that invasion is
a structure, not an event. By this he means “elimination is an organizing principle of
settler-colonial society rather than a one-off (and superseded) occurrence” (p. 388).
Thus, one cannot just point to the battles of World War II to explain Guam’s current
ontology; one has to understand WWII as a structural condition of possibility for the
transformation of the island. In a similar fashion, CHamoru erasure is a result of this
entangled structure of postwar militarization and colonialism.

As CHamorus left, postwar Guam also saw the influx of non-CHamorus into the
island. A large group of Filipinos was brought into Guam as “H-2 workers” for labor
and construction detail. Before the war, there were only a few hundred Filipinos in
Guam. However, by 1950, there were around 7,258, and as of 2010, there were 41,944
Filipinos, equivalent to 26% of Guam’s population (Quan, 2014). There was also a large
White population in Guam during the postwar era, many of them being transient per-
sonnel to fill positions in administration and education. In 1950, Whites comprised
39% of the population, though this number has dropped immensely since then.
Fellow islanders from the rest of Micronesia also moved to Guam after the Compacts
of Free Association, which allowed travel to and from United States soil without a
visa, and these immigrants now make up around 12% of the population. This in itself
is not problematic, but rather illustrative of the lack of control CHamorus had over
what their island would become after the war, producing unequal relations between
the Indigenous people of Guam and the US military when it came to subsequently
making decisions affecting the island. Yet this lack of control did not mean lack of
CHamoru resistance. When it came to the taking of land, for example, CHamorus
made their voices heard. When representatives of the US Congress visited Guam in
1949, CHamorus such as Frank Perez testified how unfair the compensation process
for the land was. Furthermore, the Guam Congress, which was only an advisory
body, did everything within its power to help resolve the land issues, from holding
conferences with naval officials, to asking for legal clarification and pushing for US
citizenship to gain protection from unbridled power.

Overall, these changes would have lasting ramifications for the island. These events
helped set the stage for the island’s contemporary status as an American territory
with heavy military presence. Changing the material realities of the island enabled
other shapes of CHamoru erasure. Dean Saranillo (2015) argues that there is a
“mutual relationship between the occupation of contested space and controlling the
representation of this occupation” (p. 285). This section explores the former, while
the next section explores the latter through an examination of the ways that settler
colonialism has instrumentalized multicultural discourse (backed by the US legal
system) to normalize the island’s current conditions.

Lastly, it is important to note that I am not concerned with intent here. One might
argue that the United States had a deliberate plan for CHamoru erasure and wanted
to create a terra nullius²² dream. One could also argue that CHamoru erasure was not
an intent and that it was a side effect of all the elements of converting the island into

a military base. Whether it was the intent of the United States or not, the fact is that
the post-World War II militarization of the island helped to create the conditions of
success for discursive CHamoru erasure in Guam today.

Erasure through “One Amongst Many”
In this section, I trace the ways that a particular form of multiculturalism has pro-
duced a “one amongst many” discourse in Guam. By “one amongst many,” I refer
to the idea that CHamorus are just like any other group in Guam, and attempts to
honor their indigeneity is a threat to the multicultural fabric of Guam’s community.
In doing this, there is an erasure of their subjectivity as “colonized peoples” in favor
of just being another group amongst many in the island. This, in turn, produces un-
equal relations as any claims towards justice can be thwarted in the US legal system.
Multiculturalism, at its most basic level, can be defined as “the coexistence of people
with many cultural identities in a common state, society, or community” (Oxford
University Press, n.d.). Multiculturalism is often celebrated as a successful achieve-
ment of modern society and is presented as a victory against blatant racism. It has
made its way into policy and academia, with goals such as multicultural education
and keywords such as “diversity” being ubiquitous in corporate models. These
basic definitions and concepts are not the cause of consternation in this piece. The
presence of a diversity of cultures in Guam is not the cause of CHamoru erasure.
CHamorus were able to co-exist with other ethnic groups throughout history with-
out any serious threat to lina'la' CHamoru (CHamoru life). In the current political
environment, it is intellectually lazy to conflate Indigenous critiques of multicultur-
alism with xenophobia or Trump-era anti-immigrant discourse, and it is my hope
that this piece will help to distinguish these critiques from such xenophobic dis-
course. In making this distinction, I hope to underscore how settler colonial logics
utilize the discourse of multiculturalism towards erasure that is the onus of concern
here, and in doing so seek to erase indigeneity while maintaining unequal relations.

Elizabeth Povinelli (as cited in Saranillo, 2015) argues that “in modern liberal demo-
cratic societies, multiculturalism is a characteristic of settler colonialism” that often
creates “the conditions under which indigenous peoples are forced into a politics of
recognition and authenticity in order for their claims to not be disqualified” (p. 285).
To put it another way, in order for Indigenous peoples to actually make claims, they
often have to “prove” their authenticity or why they should be treated any differently
(similar to how Native American tribes petitioning for federal recognition must
submit paperwork showing cultural authenticity and continuity). This consistent
requirement of “proving” facilitates projects of erasure: failing to prove authenticity
can mean a rejection of either legal or discursive weight to their grievances, thus
enforcing unequal relations between the US government and Indigenous peoples.

I argue that this exists in Guam today via a particular form of multiculturalism. As
Michael Lujan Bevacqua and I (2016) argue regarding multiculturalism in Guam,
     Despite this emphasis on equality or diversity, in truth all cultures are supposed
     to respect and adhere to the dominance of a single, oftentimes invisible culture
     that will act as the mediator, telling each culture what it is allowed to practice
     and how much of its language should be spoken. This culture is dominant in
     the way it does not provide particularity to the multicultural matrix, but instead
     its particularity acts as the universal structure. (p. 262)
Thus, this understanding of multiculturalism is of a specific discourse that acts as an
“assimilationist machine” serving the militarized, territorial needs of empire.

The danger of this circumstance is the subsequent minoritization of Indigenous
peoples, or in Guam’s case, the positioning of CHamorus as just one amongst many.
Under this discourse, Indigenous peoples are presented as just another ethnic
group or race within the multicultural fabric of society. The condition of possibility
of erasure is the conflation of indigeneity with race or ethnicity. One of the most
cited definitions of Indigenous peoples can be found in a 1986 U.N. study by Special
Rapporteur Jose Martinez Cobo, where he defines Indigenous peoples as
     Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a his-
     torical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed
     on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the soci-
     eties now prevailing in those territories or parts of them. They form at present
     non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and
     transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identi-
     ty, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their
     own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.
Per this definition, Indigenous is two-pronged: a long-established deep connection
to the land (predating historical displacement by other groups) and the existence
of an unjust social relationship usually as a result of colonialism or current state

repression—or both. Indigeneity is not race, and to conflate the two is to erase pros-
pects for self-determination and sovereignty.

As Choctaw scholar Jodi Byrd (2011) writes on the role of minoritization, “Under
this paradigm, American Indian national assertions of sovereignty, self-determina-
tion, and land rights disappear into US territoriality as indigenous identity becomes
a racial identity and citizens of colonized indigenous nations become internal
ethnic minorities within the colonizing nation-state” (p. xxvi). Byrd argues that
when indigeneity becomes erased and Indigenous peoples are simply considered
ethnic minorities, their claims to self-determination are essentially erased. In this
framework, Indigenous peoples become just “one amongst many” ethnic groups
in a particular place. Indigenous struggles for sovereignty and rights are too easily
dismissed as either affirmative action policies or illegal, unfair practices.²³

In Guam, one can find examples of this “one amongst many” discourse in which
CHamorus are represented as just another ethnic group in the island. I provide two
here. First, Dave Davis, introduced earlier, previously had a weekly column in the
Marianas Variety, a newspaper he used as a platform for anti-CHamoru sentiments.
In his anti-CHamoru writings, one catchphrase stands out: “Our Guam license plates
carry a logo translated as ‘Land of the Chamorro,’ home to the ancient Chamorro
it certainly was, but that was then and this is now” (Davis, 2011). While not direct-
ly stating “multiculturalism,” his words would later come to life when he sued the
Government of Guam due to what he considered to be CHamorus discriminating
against non-CHamorus on the issue of the political status plebiscite.

Second, in March of 2015, fellow CHamoru scholar Michael Lujan Bevacqua and
I organized “Ha'ånen Fino' Chamoru Ha',” a day in which we encouraged every-
one to speak in the CHamoru language as much as possible regardless of where
they were or what they were doing. There were close to 100 people who actively
participated and wrote about their experiences. While this event was a great push
for CHamoru language revitalization and led to many taking first steps to learn
the language, the discursive power of the logics of erasure were still inescapable.
In reflecting on their experiences of this event, some participants said they were
harassed by non-CHamorus for speaking CHamoru to them. In one particular in-
stance, a non-CHamoru waitress asked a CHamoru speaker ordering food, “Why
are you speaking that language? I don’t understand, this is America” (M. Bevacqua,
personal communication, 2015). These examples display the friction and dissent-
ing views on where the CHamoru people, language, and culture fit within Guam
in this “modern time.”

This discursive force of CHamoru erasure does not just stay in the realm of dis-
course. It also manifests itself through legal institutions and most recently in the
Davis v. Guam lawsuit through the instrumentalizing of individual voting rights and
the invocation of civil rights. Arnold “Dave” Davis is a White settler and retired Air
Force officer. He attempted to register for the Decolonization Registry, which was a
registry established by Guam Law 25-106, yet he was turned away because he did not
meet the criteria of being a native inhabitant (Leon Guerrero, 2014). In 2011, Davis
sued the Government of Guam, the Guam Election Commission and other related
parties, reasoning that he was being discriminated against because of his inability to
register for the Decolonization Registry and subsequently vote in the political status
plebiscite. His attorneys argued that this was a violation of the Voting Rights Act, the
Organic Act of Guam, and his Fifth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment rights.

Breitbart, the news hub of the alt-right movement, ran a piece on the Davis case that
stated, “Many of the territory’s elected officials and anti-American activists are start-
ing to resemble the unabashed segregationists of the Old South of the 1950s. Think
of it as a Pacific Islander version of Plessy vs. Ferguson” (von Spakovsky & Clegg, 2017).
The same lead author, in the conservative publication National Review, writes,
      To base decisions on your ancestry when parceling out political power is anath-
      ema to the 15th Amendment. It is the sort of vile evil that the Voting Rights Act
      of 1965 rooted out. But it is alive and well on Guam and will continue unless
      a federal judge finally acts to stop this modern, progressive “identity politics”
      version of Jim Crow discrimination. (von Spakovsky, 2016)
One can see settler colonial logics at work here in aiming to preserve unequal rela-
tions as a method of ensuring access to land (even if not the intention), in the form
of retaining Guam’s political status quo and the consequent military presence in the
island. This is a completely dehistoricized argument that does not take into account
Guam’s complicated history, including the complete transformation of the island after
the war and the lack of CHamoru sovereignty. Further, by enforcing settler colonial

logics, CHamorus are positioned as “one amongst many” who want to disenfranchise
others. CHamoru subjectivity as colonized people is erased in these narratives.

In laying bare the agenda of this lawsuit and countering this “Jim Crow” discourse,
we find that Davis v. Guam fits within a history of “reverse discrimination” that is
being used to thwart movements for Native, Black, and Latinx liberation. The boil-
erplate complaint is that White Americans are being discriminated against by any
program that seeks to serve non-White communities (even if these programs are
meant to right historical wrongs). This argument is strengthened when one looks at
Davis’ legal representation, most especially the Center for Individual Rights, which
has helped dismantle affirmative action programs throughout US universities. For
example, in 1999, “the Center for Individual Rights launched a national campaign
urging students to sue their colleges for racial discrimination” (Flanders, 1999).
Furthermore, according to the Center for Individual Rights (n.d.), they have “brought
a series of high-profile cases designed to get the government out of the business of
classifying citizens by race.” The group calls this color-blindness. Color-blindness,
often seen as the antithesis to multiculturalism, attempts to erase racial differences
or celebration of these differences in favor of what advocates purport to be neutral
treatment of all. Thus, both multiculturalism and color-blindness can be used to-
wards Indigenous erasure, especially in the US legal system. The ties that bind them
is the conflation of CHamoru indigeneity with a simple racial designation.

Judi Rohrer (2016) describes this particular use of the US legal system as a one-two
punch against Indigenous peoples. The first punch is to problematize collective
Native identity and the second punch is to naturalize White settler subjectivity via
a color-blind ideology (Rohrer, 2016). Lawsuits such as Davis’ serve as camouflaged
attempts at usurping CHamoru self-determination. They present themselves as
advocating for justice and equality while supporting the existence of colonial struc-
tures. As argued by Serrano (2018),
     This co-optation of civil rights tightly constrains the rights of Indigenous
     peoples. It does so in part by discounting the history of colonization—the
     confiscation of land, barring of language, suppression of identity, and loss of
     self-governance—and its harsh present-day consequences. Once stripped of
     this historical and modern-day context, “programs to uplift indigenous people
     in their homeland [are] recast as simply wrong-headed ‘racial preferences.’”
     Politically, the success of these coordinated reverse-discrimination legal chal-
     lenges … threaten Indigenous efforts to restore a measure of self-determination
     and self-government. (p. 510)
This is by far the scariest component of the picture. When self-determination is
wrongfully recast as just selfish racial preference, it can affect how others view the
issue and lead to the continuation of unequal relations between CHamorus and
the US military (via the US federal government) regarding the island’s destiny. If
CHamoru self-determination is wrongfully recast as an inherently “exclusionary”
process, then the project of CHamoru erasure is easier to complete. Lastly, if this
thought process and discourse is enforced via the power of the colonial legal system,
then CHamoru erasure reaches a new pinnacle. Erasure can occur through the insti-
tutionalization of “equality” as seen in the Davis case. Davis would eventually go on
to win his case, and sadly many in Guam were not surprised. We know that the US
legal system is skewed against Indigenous peoples and unincorporated territories.
This form of CHamoru erasure is perhaps the most expected.

The idea for this chapter came from asking myself two questions, “How does the
inability of a White settler, retired Air Force officer, to participate in a vote meant to
right the colonial wrongs of 400 years become conflated with the massive push by
African Americans to rid the shackles of slavery and participate fully in the society
they were forced to enter?” and “How does Guam history simply get erased to the
point where CHamorus can be viewed as just another ethnic group in the island?”
I use the guises of CHamoru erasure to better understand this. This erasure was
built on a material, physical transformation after the war and gains its strength
via a discourse of “one amongst many” which conflates indigeneity with race and
enforced via lawfare in US legal institutions. Settler colonial theory is a useful ana-
lytical frame in understanding all this physiology of erasure. Ending here, however,
leaves one unfulfilled and uncertain about the future. I turn to the final section for a
glimpse of something different.

Paving Other Paths (Warning Beacons and New Relationalities)
It is my hope that this piece has two lasting effects. The first is to serve as a warn-
ing beacon to other Indigenous peoples. CHamoru erasure was not the result of a
single event or policy. Erasure takes many forms including physical, discursive, and
legal shapes, and many forms co-exist simultaneously. Thus, it is impossible to place

blame on any single factor, and not every factor was deliberately deployed to erase
CHamorus. In this chapter, I navigated the historical landscape from land-taking to
community discourse to lawsuits. My experience is indicative of the multi-faceted
work of tracking the elements of Indigenous erasure. Yet, the ramifications of failing
to track the emerging shapes of erasure are too great for us to fail. Indigenous peo-
ples must continue to work together on a multiscalar level (local, national, regional,
and international level) to share their stories and warn others of the forms erasure
took in their respective experiences, locales, and stories. Kanaka Maoli scholar,
Noelani Goodyear Kaʻōpua (2013) describes Indigenous as a category of alliance.
This alliance is critical, and I hope that the story of CHamoru erasure outlined here
can strengthen these intra-Indigenous alliances.

The second hope I have for this piece is for it to serve as a discussion point for alterna-
tive forms of relationalities between CHamorus and non-CHamorus in Guam. Davis
v. Guam has shown how there are some in Guam who look at CHamoru self-deter-
mination as a zero-sum endeavor. For them, for CHamorus to self-determine or for
Guam to be decolonized, non-CHamorus must pay the costs. This manifests in vari-
ous ways, with non-CHamorus arguing that decolonization leads to marginalization
of non-CHamorus, or non-CHamorus being kicked off the island if Guam were to
decolonize. There are ways to move beyond this zero-sum depiction of CHamoru
self-determination, and I hope this piece becomes a part of that conversation. So,
even if it will be hard to change the legal elements or overcome the physical transfor-
mation, I ponder what courses of action the community can take. To put it another
way, is there a future for Guam in which CHamorus and non-CHamorus co-exist in
an affirmative way that holds the unfinished quest of CHamoru self-determination
as important? In many ways, this work has already begun.

On June 28, 2013, “Beyond the Fence,” the local Public Radio Guam (KPRG) show,
aired a very interesting episode. It was entitled, “Ep. 151 Guam Filipinos in Support
of Chamorro Self-Determination.” According to the program host, the goal of this
particular show was to give airtime to those Filipinos who acknowledge they are
not eligible to vote in a possible political status plebiscite in Guam, and yet are still
supportive of Chamorro self-determination. The impetus for the show was the cel-
ebration of Araw ng Kasarinlan, or “Day of Freedom,” where Filipinos celebrate the
Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain. This day is celebrated in Guam
with various events held throughout the month allowing Filipinos to acknowledge
their political independence. The program hosts wanted Filipinos to think of their
role in relation to the CHamoru people and the CHamoru decolonization move-
ments. When I first heard this particular program, I knew there was something
special about it. The basic premise of this episode shows non-CHamorus being com-
pletely comfortable imagining a future for the island that does not neatly fit within
the political family of “America.” Furthermore, the guests were unabashedly vocal
that as non-CHamorus they would not be voting in the political status plebiscite and
that they completely understood why. They were the antidote to the Davis poison.

Critical conversations between CHamorus and non-CHamorus on their respectful
responsibilities need to continue, and to be amplified and multiplied. Now more than
ever, we need new ways of connecting to one another. As Dean Saranillo (2015) notes,
     By taking seriously Indigenous knowledges and economies, we can create an-
     other future, and in the creation of an alternative future, more space for mutual
     respect can occur. Settler states have no interests in non-Natives identifying
     with Native movements, as such identification opens our world to alternatives
     that the settler state denies are possible. (p. 204)
As CHamoru self-determination still needs to be exercised, we have two futures
ahead of us. The first is a continuation and exacerbation of CHamoru erasure;
the second is a decolonial future of new relations amongst CHamorus and non-
CHamorus in Guam. May this piece serve as one push towards the latter. Erasure is
not an acceptable outcome in the land of the CHamoru people. I write this piece as
one instrument of my resistance. As the visual expression of an aggressive call from
a mountaintop. A voice yelling, Ti Siña Ma Funas Ham. “They Cannot Erase Us.”

Language Change in Saipan: Attitudes and Visions (Dominique B. Hess)

Saipan has experienced several foreign administrations over the past centuries:
the Spanish, German, Japanese, and finally the United States after World War II.
Amongst the many consequences of these political changes, these administrations
brought their own language to Saipan so that the island has been in close contact
with different languages for almost 350 years. Each of these foreign languages has left
its mark on the local languages at different linguistic and social levels. Here we ex-
amine the influence of English on the local community in Saipan and its emergence
as the dominant language on the island. Moreover, local Chamorro and Carolinian
speakers contribute their own perspectives towards the current language situation
and their visions for Saipan’s linguistic future. The data used for this chapter are
taken from recorded conversations with the local community—a linguistic corpus
(a collection of written and spoken texts) collected in June-August 2015 containing
95 sociolinguistic interviews with Indigenous Chamorros and Carolinians ranging
in age from 12-79 years.²⁴

Although different dialects of English were used by whalers, beachcombers, traders
and missionaries in the 19th century, the first significant incursion of English into the
Saipan community was when the Americans started administering the Northern
Mariana Islands in 1944. English started to be taught in school and was, and often
still is, seen as the language of educational possibilities, success, Westernization,
and access to a “New World.” According to a middle-aged male Chamorro speaker,
Sa47m34²⁵, “[t]he English language is the most important around the world. It’s the
first language that people should [use to] communicate around the world because if
we don’t communicate [in] English … how can we communicate?” Parents believe
that English is the key to giving their children the best possible future, and thus often
speak English at home and use the local languages less frequently. Consequently,
the emergence of English as a first language has been observed over the years. A
generational shift has been taking place, which has resulted in the younger genera-
tion speaking mostly in English with only a few of the younger population in Saipan
still speaking in their Native tongue. In fact, English is used equally or more often
than other languages at home by 59% of the population, whereas only 22% of the
population speak Chamorro and 5.6% Carolinian at home (CNMI Department of
Commerce, 2010, pp. 181–86).²⁶ Other intertwined and complex factors influence the
use of the English language: in particular, global movement has had a great impact
on the language situation in Saipan.

Global Movement and Saipan
Global movement, in this chapter, is understood as human mobility into and out
of Saipan. Immigration—inward mobility—occurred as many guest workers en-
tered Saipan during the economic boom in the 1980s and 1990s when the garment
factories flourished (Farrell, 1991, pp. 648–649). Saipan turned into a multicultural
island. Japanese investors realized the opportunity for a holiday destination and
invested in tourism, resulting in the construction of hotels, restaurants, golf cours-
es, scuba-diving shops, and nightclubs, among many other recreational facilities.
According to Quimby (2016), 75% of the tourists (736,177) were Japanese. Due to the
lax immigration and labor regulations, as well as the business-friendly wage laws
in the CNMI, many guest workers made Saipan their home: Chinese workers were
primarily employed in the garment industry, Filipino workers in the tourism sector,
and only a small number of Chinese and Filipinos were employed in the construc-
tion sector and private households (Farrell, 1991, pp. 648–649; Quimby, 2016). Even as
Saipan experienced an economic and tourism decline after 2000 and many immi-
grants returned to their homelands, many long-term guest workers stayed in Saipan.
Moreover, due to new visa (Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program 2009) and airline
agreements (direct flights from Seoul as of 2006), tourism from Russia and South
Korea has been increasing, with Korea now one of the leading source markets for
the CNMI today (Camacho, 2015; US Customs and Border Protection, 2012; Horwath
HTL, 2017). Since 2012, there has also been a large increase in Chinese tourists and
immigrants. According to Horwath HTL (2017), “[a]s of the end of 2014, China took
over as the largest source market for the CNMI, accounting for 37% of total arrivals,
replacing the historically dominant player, Japan” (p. 9).

Today, only 27% of the Saipan population are Indigenous Chamorros and
Carolinians, and the rest (73%) of the population are non-local: 36% Filipinos, 7%
Chinese, 5% Koreans, and 12% who have two or more ethnic origins, among many
other ethnicities that are represented in the CNMI to a smaller extent (CNMI
Department of Commerce, 2010, p. 41). The considerable number of immigrants
and tourists in the CNMI has had a significant impact on contemporary language
use. The increase in multiculturalism in Saipan has resulted in English being used
more and more as the lingua franca.²⁷ Topping (2003) nicely describes the language
contact situation as follows:
     In the Marianas, Chamorros talk to their Filipina maids in English. The maids
     talk to the children in English. The children talk to the Korean or Chinese
     shopkeepers in English. Japanese hotel managers on Guam and Saipan talk to
     Palauan desk clerks in English. And so on. (p. 523)
Due to the economic downturn, starting in the late 1990s and lasting for about a
decade, many foreign workers and permanent residents left the island, and the pop-
ulation of the CNMI fell by 22% between 2002 and 2010 (Quimby, 2016). Despite this
mass emigration, the language situation did not change: children who had grown
accustomed to using English at home continue this practice today.

Outward mobility surged, as many local people took the opportunity to go to the US
mainland. People mostly left for educational and work reasons, but also because of
family responsibilities or medical treatment. People who have spent several years
abroad, quite naturally, have accommodated²⁸ their English to the English varieties

spoken in North America and often speak English as a first language. McPhetres
(1992) comments thus on the outward mobility and its effect on the languages:
      Perhaps as many Chamorros are living in the US mainland as in the islands.
      This out migration, particularly to Southern California, is fast assimilating
      Chamorros into American culture. In fact, most educated (high school and col-
      lege) Chamorros speak English to their children at home because this will help
      them to get ahead. In many cases, Chamorro is spoken only in anger or chas-
      tisement of the children. This is happening in the Marianas as well. A growing
      number of local children are growing up with the idea that English is their first
      language and Chamorro is something to swear in. (p. 263)
Clearly, people who have spent time in the US mainland are influenced by the English
dialects spoken there and are most likely to use English as their first language. In
some, if not most, cases this also holds true for families in the CNMI. A middle-aged
female Carolinian speaker, Sa54f43, confirms the language change in the CNMI after
returning from Hawai‘i, where she lived for 9 years: “Saipan has changed quite a
lot. It’s more Americanized than when I first left. It may be a Carolinian house, a
Chamorro house or even a Filipino or Chinese house, and they speak English.”

Furthermore, the influx of modern technology has also augmented the dominant
status of English on the island. Topping (1985) notes that “English is used in all radio
and TV broadcasting, local newspapers, and government publications” in the CNMI
(p. 128). Studies have demonstrated that media exposure leads to incidental foreign
language acquisition (Kuppens, 2010), an important consideration in the case of
Saipan when initially media only existed in the English language. Media, including
TV programs and commercials, are one of the strongest influences on the dominance
of English (Topping, 2003, p. 523). A young Chamorro speaker, Sa18m22, explains the
supremacy of English in the media: “kids are not going to sit there and watch the
older local figures speak about politics in a language that they don’t completely un-
derstand … they’re going to gravitate towards what’s funny what’s more interesting
and … that’s Western culture.” Shigemoto (1997) was concerned about the decline
of the use of local languages and argued that the impact of American mass media is
noticeable on the island and that elements of the Western culture advance into local
culture: “[M]ass media are damaging to local languages because they have displaced
traditional pastimes, such as engaging in local crafts like canoe-building or listen-
ing to stories, which are transmitted through the indigenous languages” (p. 5). Her
concern is still valid today as the use of English has gained even greater popularity.
Since 2014, a 3G network has been available in Saipan and connects the island to
the rest of the world (Bagnol, 2014). The use of English has expanded via the inter-
net, including social media like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Netflix,
and dominates all other languages. A 17-year-old teenage Carolinian girl, Sa09f17,
confirmed the predominant usage of English. When I asked her “what about on
Facebook, is it all in English or do you use Carolinian?” she answered, “no, it’s all
in English.” Hence, even people who have not been physically mobile in their lives
now have a high exposure to English spoken as a native language through various
types of media, which impacts their English language use remarkably.

Due to this constant exposure to English over time, and especially since the late
1960s when the Peace Corps²⁹ started to arrive in Micronesia and the contact possi-
bilities between the local community and Americans increased (cf. Farrell, 1991, pp.
556–557), English is spoken in everyday life on the island.

Consequences of Globalization & the Emergence of English as a Dominant Language
The consequences of globalization, and especially global movement to and away
from Saipan, as well as the emergence of English as a dominant language, have led
to social changes on the island. With the many long-term contract workers residing
in Saipan, the island society is increasingly multicultural. People of different ethnic
backgrounds live alongside each other and communicate, most typically through
English. The tension of diversity versus unity emerges and the question arises of how
traditional cultures and languages can survive in the future in such a context. An
elderly Chamorro woman, Sa62f73, clearly advocates cultural diversity and uses the
beautiful metaphor of a salad to describe the multicultural situation in Saipan:
     I look at it more of a salad. Yeah, that each of us, I’m a Chamorro, you are from
     Switzerland, but we’re all islanders, you know, we’re all Saipanese, we’re all
     here trying to make this island the best island. We’re not here to make it a little
     Philippine and we’re not here to make it a little Korea, we’re not here to make
     it a little China and a little, you know, we’re here to make a nice island, yeah.
     But see being a salad, I don’t like to make it a melting pot because you lose
     your identity. I don’t want you to lose your identity. You should have them be-
     cause that’s what brings the richness and when you eat a salad each of them has
     some different taste.

This attitude of celebrating the existing cultural diversity in Saipan clearly is in
place and was observed for example during the Liberation Day Festivities in 2015
with the slogan “Peace in Diversity.” Nevertheless, the population of Saipan pres-
ents a unity towards the outside and manages to overcome cultural tensions with a
united language—the English language.

Some speakers are aware of the fact that for them English is more easily accessible
than their local language. Sa79f24 states, “I mean sometimes like, I would tell them
like I am proud of who I am but sometimes it’s easier for me to communicate in
English than it is to communicate in Carolinian.” The younger generation especially
faces the challenge of being bilingual if not trilingual in Saipan and trying to remain
conversant in their local language. Sometimes if they do, however, they are made
fun of by their parents, as this young Carolinian girl, Sa09f17, stated: “[Y]eah [my
parents] would just look at me and give me some weird look where they’re like, ‘why
you speaking to me like that [in Carolinian]?’” Not surprisingly, the younger genera-
tion, conversely, do ridicule their parents too when speaking in the local language, as
this middle-aged woman, Sa74f35, revealed: “[M]y kids make fun of my language, it’s
mostly English.” The young Carolinian confirms that the language most often used
at home is English and is no longer the local language, as already discussed above.
Clearly, this issue of choosing English over the local languages is unidirectional.
Whatever reasons exist, English is the more frequently spoken language inside and
outside the home in local families, and consequently, it has become the easier lan-
guage to communicate in for some, and thus has emerged and been accepted as the
lingua franca in the community. Therefore, the question arises of what the future
of Saipan’s multilingual language situation might hold and what visions the local
people of Saipan have for their island.

Language Vision
The future of the language situation in Saipan is uncertain. According to Jourdan
and Salaün (2013), “[t]wo levels of linguistic tensions appear. First that which opposes
language unity vs. language diversity; young multilingual countries need language
unity to build a country out of diversity. Second that which opposes powerful inter-
national languages vs. small local languages” (p. 214). Good reasons clearly exist why
English as a shared language has emerged in the CNMI. As discussed earlier, some
local people strongly believe that English is going to be the only language spoken on
the island in the future.“I think in their [the younger] generation Carolinian is going
to erase. Everything is all English,” said Sa74f35.³⁰

On the other hand, there are people who have a vision of a multilingual Saipan.
They advocate for diversity and support the local languages with school and cultur-
al programs. Children attend Chamorro or Carolinian Language Heritage Studies
(CCLHS) during school; to celebrate, recognize, and promote Chamorro and Saipan
Carolinian heritage, the month of September is the annual Cultural Heritage Month
in Saipan, that promotes traditional dances, art, and cooking among much more (cf.
Encinares, 2016). People want, furthermore, to promote Saipan’s cultural and lin-
guistic diversity in the education system. Sa62f73 said, “On Saipan I’m not so sure a
bilingual approach is appropriate at this time; I think it’s more of a multicultural and
a multilingual approach—not [a] bilingual anymore.” This is demonstrated in the
offer of various clubs in schools that promote cultural diversity, such as the Polksai
Chamorro Club, the Refaluwasch Culture Club³¹, the Filipino Club, or the Japanese
Club (Marianas High School, 2021).

These tensions between language unity vs. diversity and global vs. local languages
contribute to language maintenance or language shift. Principal factors for language
maintenance or shift include “individual, family, community, and broader societal
factors” (Potowski, 2013, p. 322). On an individual level, if an intrinsic motivation
for learning and speaking the local languages by young speakers exists, such as by
this young Chamorro girl, Sa40f14, who stated “English is the main language here
especially in public but I like speaking Chamorro, it’s fun,” then the survival of the
local languages being spoken on the island may be prolonged. Favoring bilingual-
ism or multilingualism and having a positive attitude towards the heritage language
is one step in the direction of language maintenance. For language maintenance to
succeed, however, more is needed than a positive attitude (Potowski, 2013, p. 323).
Fishman (2013) insists on the importance of transmitting a language from one gener-
ation to the next and understanding how this transmission is shaped socioculturally,
as a result of social, economic, and political experiences (pp. 468–469).

The Indigenous languages spoken in Saipan are currently in a transitional phase
and are experiencing language shift. Ellis (2012) mentions two developments and

suggests that Chamorro and Carolinian are evolving into contemporary forms of the
local languages or a local variety of English, or both:
      A document prepared for the CNMI State Education Agency Program (Buckley
      1991) arrived at the conclusion that many indigenous children on Saipan were,
      or were soon becoming, “semi-lingual” — they were not fluent in any language.
      … The following year I suggested in a research proposal to the Public School
      System (Ellis 1992) that Saipan children were not “semi-lingual.” Rather, they
      were speaking a “transitional” form of Chamorro or SpnCRL [Saipan Carolinian]
      moving towards either “a contemporary form of Chamorro/Carolinian” or “a
      localized style of English,” and sometimes both. (pp. 352–353)
Which direction the Indigenous languages will be taking, however, is still uncer-
tain. From the conversations I had with members of the local community during
my fieldwork and from the perspective of my research, I can only comment on the
emergence of a local variety of English (cf. Hess, in press). The English spoken in
Saipan is indeed developing its own character. The localized style of English, how-
ever, is socially conditioned by, for example, whether local speakers have positive
attitudes towards the English language, have spent several years abroad in the US
mainland, what educational background speakers have had, or their level of expo-
sure to English media. One possible vision for the language outcome is the mixing
of English and the Native languages. This mixing of languages is slowly but surely
occurring among the younger generation, as a middle-aged female speaker, Sa54f43,
explains that “The English language also is added into the speech of our young ones.
It’s really, really funny sometimes when you, when you’re talking to them because
they’re using Chamorro, English and Carolinian in one sentence, you know. Yeah,
they’re mixing it all up.” A young Carolinian girl, Sa79f24, also commented on the
mixing of the languages and called it the “Saipanese way.” She states,
      I have some co-workers you know they’re like local too so like we speak this,
      uhm, local English and I don’t know if you ever heard of it. It’s like where we
      mix like our local words and English like I don’t know it’s confusing … It’s
      English but then it’s just like the local way of talking English that’s how I’d say
      it the Saipanese way.
In this sense, the people of Saipan try to make the English language their own and
adapt it into their specific culture to fit its purpose for the local community. The English
spoken in Saipan is “Saipanese English” and has its own distinctive local “flavor” to it.
Clearly, languages are dynamic and ever-changing. Saipan has been in close con-
tact with different languages since the Spanish first set foot on the island, and its
languages continued to be impacted by the languages of the different administra-
tions, by the languages chosen for education, by globalization and especially global
movement into and out of Saipan, as well as media exposure nowadays. This has
had a considerable effect on the language situation in Saipan, whereby the English
language has become more and more the dominant language both inside and out-
side of the home. Linguistic visions of English being the dominant language exist
alongside efforts at promoting the local languages. Currently, the local languages
and English are in a transitional phase and are undergoing language change. It is
hard to predict what path a language, or in this case languages, is taking; however,
the vision of a “Saipanese way” of speaking English, a localized variety of English,
may be a reality very soon. Languages are what people make of them, shaping them
in a way that reflects their history and their identity. We can only speculate on the
future of the languages spoken in Saipan, their ongoing development, their main-
tenance, shift or loss, or their spread to speakers of other ethnicities and, thus, who
will be speaking them in the future.

What Saved Me (Victoria-Lola M. Leon Guerrero)

Author Note: While this essay is based on real events, some names were changed.

When I was five, I would venture outside every evening at six. We had a big ka-
machili tree in our front yard, and I would run to it, excited to play with my “friends”
as I had called them. I remember the scene—the red-orange hue of the sky as the
last rays of sun peaked through the tree’s canopy and the mystic glow around me. It
was magical. My favorite time of day. Until my mom realized what I had been doing.

“Toya, come back inside. It’s after six,” she said quietly, bending down to take my
hands and pull me up. “You know the taotaomo'na come out at six. You’re not sup-
posed to be out here.”

I quietly followed her into the house, feeling a deep sadness as I looked back to the
tree. The next day, ignoring what my mom had said, I made for the door at sunset,
but this time, my mom followed quickly.

“Where are you going, Toya? It’s six. It’s time to stay inside. Come help me in the kitchen.”
“But Mama, my friends are going to miss me.”
“What friends?”
“My friends at the kamachili tree. They’re calling me outside to play.”
“No, Toya, it’s not time to play anymore. Let’s go finish making dinner.”

As I followed my mom to the kitchen, my ears started ringing and an intense heat
coursed through my body. I stopped walking. “Mama,” I said, “I don’t feel good.”

“Oh Toya, you’re so pale!” my mom exclaimed when she turned to look at me. She
felt my forehead and said I was burning up. She carried me into my room, placed
me on my bed and told me to rest while she got me some water and medicine. I fell
into a deep sleep. The next morning, my fever was gone, but my mom kept me home
from school. She watched me closely all day, but I was perfectly healthy.

“Mama, can I go outside?” I asked while standing at the screen door staring at
the kamachili tree.
“No, Toya, it’s getting late.”
“Please mama,” I pleaded.
“No.”

I made my way to the living room, and my ears started to ring again. I collapsed onto
the couch and began to sob.

“What’s wrong?” My mom asked, rushing over.
“I don’t feel good, mama.”
“Oh, baby, you’re burning up again. I’m going to take you to the doctor.”

When we got to the clinic, the doctor in urgent care could not figure out why my
fever was so high. He sent us back home and told me to rest and drink a lot of water.
My mom called my grandma, and she instantly knew what was wrong.

“They’re making her sick,” she told my mom, “because you’re keeping her away from
them. I’ll call Maman Rosa.”

Grandma Chilang’s cousin Maman Rosa was a suruhåna, a traditional healer, and
grandma always called her when she was sick. She would bring åmot—dark brown
teas, leaves, roots, bottles of oil, whatever the sickness called for. Grandma told her
what was happening to me, and she said she would meet us the next day at 6 p.m.
under the kamachili tree.

I stayed home from school again and was feeling well the entire day. At 5:45 that
evening, my mom and I went outside to sit with grandma in front of the house and
wait for Maman Rosa. She arrived just before six with a bottle of oil and a bundle
of dried palm leaves that had been blessed at the church on Palm Sunday. We all
headed to the tree. Feeling free again, I started to run ahead of them.

“Slow down, Toya. Come back,” my mom called after me.
“Polu ha',” Maman Rosa said, telling my mom to let me go.

Maman Rosa placed a woven mat on the earth beneath the tree and called me to
lie down. She placed my head in her lap and gently massaged oil into my temples
and between my eyes. Then she softly closed my eyes, removed my head from her
lap and placed it on the mat. I felt a stillness in the air, and the evening bustle of the
chickens and dogs in our yard started to fade. First I could smell flowers. Musky
ylang ylang wafted above me followed by the thick scent of smoke coming in and
out of my nostrils. I opened my eyes to see Maman Rosa walking around me. She
had lit the tips of the palm leaves with fire and held the bundle together like a wand
that she moved in circular motions above my body and up toward the tree, creating
patterns of smoke. Her lips moved quickly as she chanted prayers in CHamoru. I
closed my eyes again and must have drifted off to sleep, because the next thing I re-
member was being lifted to sit up and Maman Rosa placing the crucifix at the end of
her rosary beads in between my eyes, to my lips for me to kiss and then to my heart.

“Maolek,” she said. “Sen malak na palao'an hao.”

She pulled me into a deep embrace and sniffed the top of my head. My mom also
gave me a hug, and my grandma told me that everything was going to be OK. Maman
Rosa started talking to them in CHamoru, explaining that there were spirits in the
tree who had taken a liking to me. Some of them were children themselves, and they

had just wanted to play. She said I was a very bright child, and they had been calling
me to them for a while. It was only because my mom had been keeping me from
them that they were making me sick. She had used the palm leaves to bless the area
and said I would not be bothered anymore.

“They’re not bad spirits,” I remember my grandma saying. “They just really like you.
But you cannot live in their world, because we need you here.”

I never had a sense that the taotaomo'na were bad. I knew they were the spirits of
my ancestors. Like me, they enjoyed the beauty of our island, and they liked to have
fun outside. But after getting sick, I was more cautious. When I would go outside at
night, I would be very quick and quiet. If I had to throw out the trash or take clothes
from the line and the sun was already down, I would rush to complete my chore
and dash back into the house. It was not exactly fear, as much as respect for their
time and space. I did not want to intrude. As I got older, I learned how to recog-
nize their presence and show respect without having to flee. When a sudden wind
would rustle the dried leaves in the jungle, or the scent of ylang ylang would waft
by my nose at night, or a feeling deep in the pit of my stomach would stop me in my
tracks as I crossed certain trees, I knew they were there. And I would just offer a little
prayer, send them love and carry on.

In my family there are many taotaomo'na stories, and often when someone falls ill or
is the victim of an unexpected or early death, there is always a theory that connects
their misfortune to having been disrespectful to the taotaomo'na. In one of the worst
accidents of our family’s history, my Uncle Billy fell from the second story balcony of
his home while peeing over the ledge in the middle of the night. My grandpa’s sister
strongly believes that he was knocked over by a taotaomo'na, who had been passing
through the jungle surrounding the house at that very moment. She said the house
was on the path that the spirits traveled to get from the jungle to the ocean and back,
and that as they were returning to the jungle, he must have accidentally peed on one
of them, upsetting the taotaomo'na enough to push him off. My beloved uncle did
not survive that fall, and after his death the house had to be blessed with holy water
from the Catholic Church to ensure his spirit would be set free. Just a few feet away
from where he landed, there is a shrine to the Virgin Mary.

This juxtaposition of faith—our Indigenous belief in ancestral veneration and our
Catholic belief in God and Mother Mary—was how I had come to know spirituality.
I was taught to ask permission from my ancestors before entering the jungle, and
told to wear religious medals to keep bad spirits away. But as I grew older, I often
found myself caught in the middle of these two worlds, trying to find exactly where
I fit and wondering what to believe.

When I was pregnant with my first child, my family scolded me because I broke all
the rules. Pregnant women are not supposed to go into the jungle or areas where
there is a high concentration of taotaomo'na. But I had gone hiking to the ancient
village of Pågat and walked in the jungles of Luta, singing love songs and visiting
latte. My friends in Luta taught me how to protect my womb with lada' leaves from
the noni tree. I had always asked for permission and followed my instincts, but it did
not matter. I should not have been there in the first place, my parents would tell me.
They said I traveled too much while I was pregnant. I flew to Saipan and Tinian, to
Japan and Okinawa. My cousin said I was “too active” and should not have raised my
voice so passionately when I was protesting the prospect of a firing range at Pågat.
Driven by the life growing inside of me, I believed that I could not be silent about
injustice, because I was becoming a mother.

I carried my son safely in my womb until he was born, but when he entered this
world, I could not protect him any longer. He was born with a birth defect and was
rushed away from me and into an operating room. After surviving four hours of sur-
gery and then four more hours fighting for his life, Sai died in my arms. It was by far
the worst tragedy of my life. I had never felt so lost. So trapped in my fears. So guilty.
I had become unrecognizable in my grief, and my family was deeply worried. They
feared I had upset a taotaomo'na while I was pregnant and that I might still be sick.

My husband Josh and I went from being the couple dancing in the front row of a
concert to people who went grocery shopping in the middle of the night to avoid
running into people we knew. Even though we had been showered with love and
support in our loss, we really wanted to be alone. And more than anything, we
became desperate for answers. One day, a couple of months after we lost Sai, my
Auntie Cil called from Saipan and asked if I wanted to visit a suruhånu that she
really trusted to help me figure out what had happened.

“He’s the best, Nen,” she said. “He can communicate with taotaomoʼna from all of
our islands. Since you went to Luta and Tinian, he may be able to tell you if some-
thing happened there and that way if you need to go back to apologize, you can.”
“OK, Auntie Cil, can we come next week?”
“Of course, Nen, any time. You can come stay with us. I will bring you to him.”

Josh and I booked a ticket to Saipan right away, certain that this was the right thing
to do. When we got there, we spent our first day reconnecting with family and vis-
iting the graves of my grandparents and Uncle Billy. We had dinner at Auntie Mel’s
house, and it was so comforting to be around her. Auntie Mel had come to Guam for
Sai’s funeral and was there for me in a way no one else could be. She had lost two of
her own babies and talked me through the motions of burying mine—something I
had never imagined having to do.

“You have to be the one to dress him,” she had encouraged me on the day of the
funeral. “This is your only chance to dress your son. Take your time. Look at his
body. Kiss him. Love him. You don’t ever want to look back on this day and wish you
had taken more time to look at him. Study his face, so you’ll never forget it.” And
she had stood by my side the entire time as I put on his tiny, white clothes. Seeing
her in Saipan for the first time since that day made me feel safe. I did not have to
tell her what the last few months had been like. She already knew. I did not have to
ask her about what to expect with the suruhånu the next day, she dove right into the
conversation. “I know you might be worried about what Harold’s going to say to you
tomorrow, but it’s OK. You have to trust him. You need to know what happened. It’s
time you found out. And Harold, he’ll be able to tell you. You won’t even have to tell
him why you’re there. He’ll already know.”

She then shared a story I had never been told about Uncle Billy. One time, he had
gotten really sick after fishing at night. An animan tåsi had followed him home.
These spirits of the ocean are known to be the most powerful spirits. That night
when he was sleeping, his entire body went numb. He lost feeling from his toes all
the way up to his head. He could not move at all. He said he felt like someone was
choking him, but he could not lift his arms to stop it. He tried to scream for help, but
no sound would escape his mouth. He had to just lay there for hours until it went
away. This happened to him every night after that, and our family members kept
telling him to go see Harold, but he was too proud. He said the taotaomo'na liked
him. They had always led him to the best fish at night. He did not need anyone’s
help, he said. But one night, when he was playing cards at my cousin Sus’s apart-
ment, his legs started to go numb. Sus asked him why he had not gone to see Harold
yet, and Uncle Billy joked that if Harold was so good at reading minds, why had he
not come to see him yet. A few minutes later, they saw a shadow passing the window
and then heard a knock at the door. “Håfa, Billy-Bert, you called me?” Harold said
through the door, and Uncle Billy nearly lost it. He rushed to the door and let Harold
in. It took three days, but Harold made the animan tåsi go away.

Auntie Mel and I talked at the kitchen table for a few hours like this, sharing taotao-
mo'na stories, memories of Uncle Billy, whose loss was still so fresh in our family (it
had only been a year since his unexpected death), and catching up on news of all
of our relatives in Saipan and Guam. I was feeling much more like myself and was
ready to meet Harold the next morning.

Auntie Cil drove us to a mint-green house with a vibrant garden in front of it. Hibiscus
of every hue, puti tai nobiu, plumeria and orchids bloomed colorfully. Harold was
waiting for us at the front of the house. “Maila,” he called to us in CHamoru. “Come
in.” I took his hand to ningnge' him, and Josh did the same. He felt like an old friend.
Like I had known him in my childhood, and we could just pick up where we had
left off despite not having seen each other in a long time. His brown skin was tight
and youthful. His eyes were those of a man in his 40s, but his hair was completely
white like a chungi bird. It was still shiny and thick, but all white. And his hands
were wrinkled with an age beyond this lifetime. I could tell that Harold’s hands had
absorbed the sickness and pain of countless people, my relatives included.

There were a lot of roosters around the house. Some were in the back yard, tied at the
ankle to a leash rooted in the earth; others were in cages. “Are those your birds?” I asked.

“No, my brother’s. Let’s go over here.” He motioned us toward a bench on the side of
the house shaded by an ylang ylang tree. Josh and I sat on the bench, and Auntie Cil
stayed at the front of the house. I could smell the ylang ylang. The scent shot to my
gut, and it was wrenching. Did I want to know what he was going to tell me? Would
he tell me that I had done something wrong? That I had hurt my baby? Josh held my

hand, and Harold stood in front of me with a bottle of oil. I closed my eyes sensing
this was what he wanted me to do and tried to listen to him, but all I could hear were
the roosters and my fears playing over and over in my mind. Harold rubbed the oil
on my forehead and rested his palm over my third eye—the space of inner vision
between my eyes. The roosters faded to silence, and the scent of ylang ylang grew
stronger. The silence was absolute and lasted for several minutes. It filled me with
the same calm I had felt with Maman Rosa at the kamachili tree. Just as I started to
remember her, Harold spoke.

“A spirit wanted your baby,” he told me. “She is a woman, not much older than
you. I can see you through her eyes. You are at the University of Guam, and you are
rushing. You go from the parking lot to the Field House. You cross the street diago-
nally, do you remember this? There is a big tree there, do you know which one I am
talking about? The trongkon nunu?”

“Hunggan. I know exactly which one you are talking about. I remember that day. I
teach there, and I was going to turn in my grades. I was so excited the semester was
over that I practically ran into the records office in the Field House.”

“As you pass the tree, you bump into her, the spirit. She is very sad, but when she
sees you and your baby inside you, she feels happy. She wants your baby … she says
your baby is beautiful, so beautiful. Was she a girl?”

“No, a boy.”

“He is a beautiful boy. Has very feminine features, a … a woman’s energy. She sees
your baby, and she sees you, how happy you are, and she wants what you have.
She could never have children. Her whole life all she wanted was a child, and she
couldn’t have one. She doesn’t mean to hurt you, but when she sees you, she thinks
this is her chance. She tries to enter you, to take your child. You felt it … when she
bumped into you, she says you felt it. Do you remember?”

“I do. I … felt something that day. I even stopped and said, ‘Dispensa yu',’ because I
didn’t ask permission to pass under the trongkon nunu. I felt something brush me,
like a strong wind. I got cold, fugu', and just stopped in the middle of the street.”

“Your baby felt it, too. The lady tried to take him, but she couldn’t. And that struggle
is why your baby didn’t form all the way. But God won. He let you have your baby.
You got to see him, right? You got to meet him, and hold him? God let you have that.”

I was silent, but my thoughts were racing. God won? God and a spirit woman went
to battle for my baby? Why did I not know about it? Why was I not allowed to fight
for his life? It all sounded so crazy. So unfair.

Harold’s hand was still on my forehead. My eyes were still closed, and I was floating
somewhere between his bench and that trongkon nunu. For a moment, I was there,
at the trongkon nunu on that day. I remembered what it felt like to be pregnant. How
that morning I had looked in the mirror and saw a pregnant me staring back with a
newly stretched belly and fuller breasts. She was the most beautiful me I had ever
seen. And I really was happy. I wanted to stay there, in the memory of that day, and
slow down. Take the front entrance to the Field House and not the one next to the
trongkon nunu. Would that have changed Sai’s fate?

“It was not your fault,” Harold said, bringing me back to the bench.
“But I shouldn’t have walked that way.”

“There’s nothing you could have done. Your baby was not meant to be part of this
world. I know you have heard this before, and you think it’s just what people say,
but it’s true. When I look at your baby now, I can see that he was meant for some-
thing greater. He was not really a boy or a girl, but something more. I just see
brightness. God won.”

Fuck God, I thought, but could not say it out loud.

Harold removed his hand from my forehead. The oil traveled slowly down the
bridge of my nose, over my lips, and dripped into my shirt. My breasts, still full of
milk for Sai, felt the cold tingle as the oil settled between them. If he was not meant
for this life, why had they still been so full?

“Harold, I’m scared of what you saw. I’m angry with God. I … I don’t know if I
believe in God anymore. I believe in what you saw. You had no way of knowing that

I walked into the Field House that day, or how I crossed the street, so I believe you,
but I am struggling to accept this idea that God won and that I am supposed to
be happy with that.”

“You can believe whatever you want to believe. I am just telling you what
they’re telling me.”
“Saina ma'åse, Harold, I appreciate everything you have done for me today.”
“It’s Si Yu'os ma'åse, hagå-hu. Why do you people from Guam always
like to change things?”
“Ai, dispensa yu'. Si Yu'os ma'åse, Harold.”
“You have a gift, too. I can tell. If you listened, if you really listened, you could hear
them, too. They like you.”
“I’ve been told that before, that the taotaomoʼna like me. Why?”
“There’s something about you … you just need to listen, and you’ll hear them. Don’t
wipe the oil off your body, OK? Leave it on until you wake up tomorrow.”
“OK.”

We said good-bye, and the next day Josh and I flew back to Guam. I struggled for
truth, for meaning in Harold’s vision, and it made me frantic. Obsessive. I replayed
both the moment I had crossed the street that day and my visit with Harold over
and over again. I did not feel at peace, knowing that my baby was now with God.
Instead, I kept digging for more answers. Josh and I looked up what was happening
in my womb on the day I had passed that trongkon nunu. I looked in my email, saw
that grades were due the third week of May. I started counting weeks in my mind.
I would have been thirteen weeks pregnant. I typed “when does a baby’s intestines
form?” into a search engine. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Thirteen weeks into
your pregnancy, or 11 weeks after conception, your baby’s intestines have returned to
his or her abdomen from the umbilical cord … ”

Sai’s intestines had never returned to his abdomen. That was what went wrong,
biologically. His intestines had grown outside of his body in a sac called an om-
phalocele. I was speechless. This spirit’s struggle to take my baby could really have
done this, metaphysically. It was the exact week. I looked over at Josh, who was read-
ing with me, and his furrowed brow suggested that he, too, was teetering between
reality and fantasy in his mind. We had genuinely believed that our baby would
survive. Even when I felt his breath leave his body, I could not accept that it was real.
I held on to him for nearly two hours afterwards. Carrying him close to my chest,
hoping that my heart would wake him. But he never came back, and I could not
understand why. After months of searching for a reason, we finally had one, and I
didn’t know how to believe it, even though everything I had learned from my elders
told me that I should.

In our culture, we do not question our elders or their beliefs. We listen to them and
respect them, like we have always been taught to respect the taotaomo'na, our first
elders. It was easy for me to understand the woman who wanted Sai. To compre-
hend her desire for a baby, because after losing him, it was all I wanted, too. But to
accept that this was God’s plan, as my elders were telling me, was a challenge. Why
would God cause us such pain? Why would God give us a baby we could not keep?
Just as I was raised not to question my elders, they were raised not to question God.
Even though they had deep respect for the taotaomo'na, their ultimate faith was
always their belief in God and the teachings of the Church. But I could not reconcile
with God no matter how hard I tried. Not even for my mom, who kept inviting me to
church even though I would not go.

The turning point in my faith was not just about what had happened to Sai. It had
been coming for a while. I had been a devout Catholic growing up—I had received
my sacraments and attended eskuelan påle', or Sunday school, every year until I
was confirmed. I looked forward to Mass and seeing everyone from my village there.
But as I became an adult, I dug more deeply into my history as a CHamoru woman.
I read about the CHamoru-Spanish Wars and the violence and manipulation that
were used to convert and colonize my ancestors. I felt one of my best friend’s pain
when her mother turned her away and disowned her for loving a woman, because
as a Catholic, she truly believed her daughter was going to hell. I cringed every time
I read about a child who had trusted a priest and was abused by him and then aban-
doned, left to suffer with this wound in silence. Over time, I found it harder to attend
Mass without questioning the prayers or struggling through the priest’s homily. I
would leave the church feeling very sad. Thus, instead of turning to the Catholic
faith during my time of need, I turned away from it.

I have never stopped praying, but my prayers are no longer the rote prayers of my
childhood. Instead, they have become very personal and conversational, full of grat-
itude to our Creator, acceptance for all of life’s lessons and praise to the ancestors
who carved a trail for me to follow. My spiritual life has become very personal. I find
myself in the jungle more, wanting to feel connected to the spirits there. I listen to
them more deeply, as Harold had advised, and I can hear them in ways I had not
before. Tracing their footsteps deeper into the halom tåno, I have found the freedom
I had felt as a child running to the kamachili tree. And that is truly what saved me.

Contemporary Dynamics of Traditional Healing in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Tricia Lizama)

In 2008 or thereabouts, I was faced with the daunting task of choosing a dissertation
topic. Critical to this reflection process was selecting a topic that would contribute to
the literature on the CHamoru people. As a young child, I grew up with a grandma
who always had a type of tea or chå brewing on the stove top and then later stored in
the refrigerator. Her brews served as a remedy for colds, congestion, and the flu, but
the “why” or “what was in the chå” was never understood. Nånan Biha (Grandma)
said that those who were born breech were recognized as “having good hands.” My
grandma gave me directions for massaging young babies and children due to my
“having good hands,” but no other explanation as to “why” was offered.

When my aunt became ill, she was taken to a healer and “diagnosed” with having a
spiritual sickness. Many of these experiences and the unanswered “whys” became
the impetus for choosing a dissertation topic. The dissertation became the means
of resolving these unanswered questions. On this journey, I met many healers and
interviewed at least 40 healers in Guam, Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. The interviews

lasted between 2 and 4 hours each, and many of the healers had such a wealth of
information that subsequent visits with them were arranged. Through these inter-
views and the relationships established with the healers, many of the “whys,” along
with the whom, what, and when, were answered. I share a glimpse of the worldview
of the Mariana Islands healer in this chapter. In addition, I provide an exploratory
overview of the current state of traditional healing in the Marianas. The chapter
concludes with a consideration of the future of traditional healing in the region.

Literature Review
Many studies have documented traditional healing in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Marianas (CNMI) and Guam. Although Guam and the Mariana Islands
have varied colonial histories, they share the same cultural history and practices.
The main function of the Native healers of the CHamoru and Carolinian people, the
suruhåna or suruhånu, was (and still is) to promote good health within the commu-
nity, which will in turn enhance the survival potential of the population (McMakin,
1978). The assumption driving the promotion of good health is that without good
health, other forms of cultural activities will be affected. Many of the statements
below are examples of how important and valued the role of a traditional healer was
and still is. Thompson (1947), writing about the art of being a suruhåna or suruhånu,
stated that due to colonization,
     already much has disappeared, and if the remainder is not recorded before the
     present generation of herb specialists dies out, an important survival of ancient
     Chamorro culture will probably be lost—a survival which, upon scientific in-
     vestigation, may yield results valuable to modern medicine. (p. 198)
McMakin (1978) noted in his anthropological study of the suruhåna/u that the craft
of being a suruhåna/u was “the most intact survival of a cultural activity of the
pre-contact Chamorro” (p. 14). McMakin (1978) further stated that the use of tradi-
tional medicine in Guam has persisted through time due to the continued demand
for the practice. Workman, Cruz-Ortiz, and Kamminga-Quinata (1994) also con-
firmed through their interviews of 33 people that the Indigenous practice of healing
and curing with herbs has survived. Lizama (2011) conducted her dissertation on
preserving and perpetuating traditional healing practices in modern Guam. Lizama
conducted a qualitative study and interviewed 11 traditional healers. In her findings,
all of the healers were practicing and valued the importance of their knowledge
and passing it on. These authors show that throughout Guam’s history, traditional
healers have been an important component to health care in Guam. This statement
is also true for the CNMI.

In order to recognize the practice of traditional healers in the CNMI, Borja and
Roppul (2009) published the Directory of Traditional Healers and Medicinal Plants in
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Borja and Roppul were able to
interview and document 45 CHamoru and Carolinian healers. They noted in the bi-
ography compiled for each of these 45 healers that each was able to apprentice with
another healer before practicing on their own. Borja and Roppul’s compilation of the
45 healers into a directory is significant as it is a way of preserving and perpetuating
the knowledge that these healers have, and this effort of compiling a directory was
the first of its kind. Furthermore, Demapan (2011) conducted an ethnographic study
focusing on exploring the contemporary medical practices of traditional healers in
the CNMI. Demapan used the healers from the Directory of Traditional Healers and
Medicinal Plants in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas to find her study sub-
jects. Although only 12 of the healers met the criteria for her study, Demapan was
able to conclude the following: 1) traditional healer candidates have to be interested
and have to be recognized as being a potential healer; 2) most traditional healers said
they treated a range of sicknesses including physical, psychological, and spiritual
sickness; and 3) the primary role as a suruhånu and suruhåna is to treat the sick and
to be a helping member of the community. In addition, a qualitative study by J.E.H.
Arriola (2009) focused on exploring and constructing the CHamoru epistemology
of mental health. Arriola constructed the CHamoru epistemology of cultural values
and developed a theoretical model called “I Sisteman Nuebo yan I Tiempon Antes”
(The New System and Old Times), to explain the CHamoru epistemology of mental
health. Through his model, Arriola was able to identify the suruhånu and suruhåna
as cultural figures who have a very important role in preventing and treating the
dysfunctional imbalances of a person. M. Arriola (2015) conducted a study entitled
“Patients’ Perspectives on Indigenous Health Care Received from Suruhånas and
Suruhånus on the Pacific Island of Saipan.” One of her conclusions from this study
was that traditional healing is still being used by many people in Saipan. In addition,
another conclusion via her participant interviews was that traditional healers are
perceived as prominent cultural figures who continue to play a vital role as helpers
and healers in the community. We can conclude from this literature that the role of
traditional healers in Guam and in the CNMI is a very important one and is being

preserved and documented (J. E. H. Arriola, 2009; M. Arriola, 2015; Borja & Roppul,
2009; Demapan, 2011; Lizama, 2011; McMakin, 1978; Thompson, 1947; Workman et
al., 1994). These various studies have documented that the people of the CNMI and
Guam continue to seek out services from suruhånu or suruhåna for the diagnosis
and treatment of minor ailments, spiritual ailments, and chronic disease.

History of Traditional Healing
Traditional healing practices, particularly the use of herbal medicine, have been
used in the and Guam for centuries. In the CNMI, the traditional healer is known
as the suruhånu (male healer) or the suruhåna (female healer). In Guam, the first
healers were known as makåhna and kakåhna (shamans who were believed to have
magical powers). With the impact of Spanish colonization and the introduction of
Christianity, the makåhna and kakåhna no longer practiced. However, others believe
that the makåhna and kakåhna continued practicing but identified themselves as
suruhånu and suruhåna (derived from cirujano, the Spanish loanword for “surgeon”).
Today in the CNMI, the healer is still commonly called a suruhånu or suruhåna,
and sometimes called a yo'åmte, while in Guam the healer is identified as a yo'åmte
(meaning “a deeper type of healer”). The terms suruhånu and suruhåna are still
used in Guam, but people are starting to use the term yo'åmte more frequently.

Types of Healing
Suruhånu, suruhåna, and yo'åmte use different kinds of herbs and plants to make
remedies for sickness. Sickness can be defined as physical, spiritual, and emotional
illness. In both the CNMI and Guam, each healer is capable of performing a variety
of healing in addition to practicing a particular specialty. For example, a healer can
make åmot (medicine), and provide lasa (massage) and suffe' (working with the spir-
its or taotaomo'na). Some healers can do all three types of healing (åmot, lasa, and
såffe), and some can do a combination of two types of healing. It is more common to
find healers doing the åmot and the lasa. Due to the nature of the healing with the
spirits, only some healers choose to do this type. Many healers have commented that
spiritual healing requires greater energy, because the healer must be stronger than
the spirit. If the spirit is stronger, the healer can get sick or be affected negatively by
the spirit. As a result, healers are more cautious about working with spirits. Based on
what the patient tells them, they can assess the strength of the spirit. At that point,
they must decide whether to treat the patient or refer the patient to another healer
who specializes in spiritual healing. Another important concept that was noted in
interviews conducted by Borja and Roppul (2009) concerning treatment of patients,
is the concept of hiningok (“to be heard”). This concept implies that the medicine
must be meant for that person being treated if it is to work. If it is not meant to be,
ti hiningok, then the medicine or treatment will not work on the patient. A physical
sign of ti hiningok is if the åmot wilts in the hands of the healer. If this happens, the
understanding is that the åmot will not work or the patient will not come for treat-
ment (Borja & Roppul, 2009). This implies that åmot also has a spirit nature. This is
also probably why many of the healers explained that it is always important to pray
to the spirits before and during the administration of the åmot (J. E. H. Arriola, 2009;
M. Arriola, 2015; Borja & Roppul, 2009; Demapan, 2011; Lizama, 2011, 2014).

Healers treat a variety of ailments, such as fevers, mouth sores, rashes, toothaches,
cuts and burns, sprained ankles, female issues, and congestion. Just as healers have
a specialty, they also have sub-specialties with the type of patients and ailments they
treat. For example, there are healers who specialize in treating illness of babies and
congestion. Others help with female problems such as heavy bleeding, menopause,
or fertility issues. These healers can address other issues, but most have a specialty.
If a patient comes to the healer for a problem that the healer is not able to help with,
the healer refers the patient to another healer in the community who can help. This
concept is very similar to Western medicine in that a doctor trains for a specific field.
All doctors basically have the same initial training. After several years of training,
the doctor identifies a specialty such as internal medicine, obstetrics, psychiatry, or
pediatrics. Among healers, a specialty is chosen for them based on what was passed
on to them from previous generations. An example is a female healer in Rota who
knows many of the herbal plants, but patients seek her out primarily for one illness,
shingles, Tininun San Antonio in CHamoru. Her mother was the expert in treat-
ing Tininun San Antonio, and her mother passed her knowledge on to this healer.
Although this healer has knowledge of many herbal plants, her primary specialty
is treating shingles. According to Borja and Roppul (2009) and Demapan (2011),
healers have specialties and can be classified into the following categories: physical,
psychological, and spiritual.

The Process of Becoming a Healer					
Knowledge of traditional healing is generally kept within families and passed on

from one generation to another. Healers usually learn their craft from their mother,
grandmother, father, grandfather, or another close relative. As young children, some
at only 2 or 3 years of age, they begin to accompany their relative to identify, pick, and
gather medicine. Actual training to be a healer starts at a very young age. After the
child is proficient in identifying the plant, herbs, and roots, they are sent off to iden-
tify and pick herbs on their own. This training continues when the child observes
how the herbs are cleaned and prepared. Youth can spend years of observing until
they are deemed ready to practice. At that point, they are given more responsibility
for preparing the åmot with the assistance of the healer until the healer is confident
that the “apprentice” is ready to prepare the åmot independently.

Although being able to identify and prepare the åmot are very important in the
training process, there are many more important “rules” that the “apprentice” has to
learn. There are rules about respect and entering the jungle as well as rules about the
relationship that one has with the environment, the spirit world, and God. For ex-
ample, before anyone enters the jungle, the person must ask the spirits of the jungle
for permission to enter. CHamorus believe that spirits exist everywhere. If someone
were to enter the jungle without asking permission, negative consequences might
ensue. Some people claim that a part of their body became swollen, or a purple
bruise appeared on their arm or leg as if someone “pinched” them. In Rota, a healer
was observed who not only asked permission to enter the jungle but also asked
permission from the plants that she was taking as part of her åmot. She chanted to
the plants to ask permission to take only a few of the leaves because that was what
she needed at the time. She also assured the plants that she was very appreciative
of them because they helped her to heal someone who needed help. In addition to
asking permission, healers observe rules that regulate when the åmot can be picked
and under what conditions. Many healers suggest that the åmot be picked early in
the morning. Also, the consensus is that as long as it is not raining, the åmot can be
picked before 3 p.m. They discourage picking after 3 p.m. because that is when the
“not so nice” spirits roam and can “intercept” the åmot. The mean spirits can cause
the åmot to become bad, making it useless or ineffective.

The last set of rules for healers involves learning what time of day they can treat
people and what is acceptable and unacceptable for “payment.” The rules of when
not to treat people are very similar to the rules of when to pick åmot. Healers can
treat people during most of the day but will stop at around 3 p.m. This is in line with
the belief that the mean spirits are more prone to roam after 3 p.m. Healers believe
that people should never be treated and åmot should never be picked or transported
between 5 to 6 p.m. This is the time that many of the mean spirits roam. Due to the
long training time and the intricacies of being a healer, the process of learning how
to be a traditional healer takes years and is safeguarded within the family.

Training goes beyond learning about the medicine; the child is also taught about mas-
sage or lasa. CHamorus believe that a child with “good hands” is born breech (bottom
or feet first) and has the gift of massaging. Healers believe that, if a child has the gift,
then it should be nurtured. However, children do not perform massage at an early age
because they do not have the strength. They probably just massage babies and people
within their own family. There are certain rules that govern the act of massaging. A
woman should never massage when she is experiencing menstruation. A male healer
who massages should not massage a woman for fertility issues because that involves
having to touch the woman’s vagina, which may not be acceptable to her husband.
The healer may also experience fear of being accused of sexual assault.

Many of the rules regarding traditional healing are still very much intact in modern
times. The jungle is still respected, permission is sought, and rules for picking plants
and propagating them are followed. All of these rules are based on CHamoru values
and culture. J. E. H. Arriola (2009) constructed the epistemology of CHamoru values
as follows: (1) Yu'os Tåta (God the Father), who is believed to be the ultimate authori-
ty in the lives of the CHamoru people; (2) familia (family) life, which revolves around
the family unit; (3) tano' (land), which is understood to be the roots of cultural
identity; (4) inafa'maolek (interdependence), understood as a cultural practice that
promotes the value of respetu (respect) and fosters harmonious interaction among
the people, as well as between the people and the land; (5) chenchule' (gifted reci-
procity), understood as an unspoken obligation done out of respect and gratitude to
assist a family in need; (6) mamåhlao (shame), to be respectful and humble in the
presence of other people; (7) manayuda (assistance), the act of helping family and
friends; (8) manåmko' (elderly), people of age who are given the utmost respect; and
(9) taotaomo'na (ancestral spirits), who are worshiped and thought of as spiritual
forces that help with the harmonious flow of inafa'maolek between the people, land,
and the universe (p. 21).

Currently, there are an estimated 80 to 90 healers in the CNMI and Guam. The
Directory of Traditional Healers and Medicinal Plants in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Marianas (Borja & Roppul, 2009) identifies 45 healers who were interviewed
in the CNMI; however, not all the healers were interviewed, out of respect for tradi-
tional practices. Generally, healers do not advertise. Accessing a healer is via word of
mouth. One would never see an advertisement of a healer promoting their services.
Being interviewed and listed in the directory can be seen as a very public act and may
be perceived by some healers as advertisement. However, Borja and Roppul (2009)
argued that documenting the identity and knowledge of the traditional healers will
support the preservation of the Indigenous knowledge and provides a resource to the
community, by means of a directory which will help others gain access to traditional
healers instead of just by word of mouth. Typically, healers work out of their home.
Currently, there are no partnerships between the hospitals in the CNMI or Guam
and the healers. Many doctors in the CNMI and some doctors in Guam, mostly
CHamoru, are aware of the existence of the healers. In an informal conversation with
a pediatrician in Guam, he said that if a baby were heavily congested or had a bad
cold, he would refer the child to a healer. He added that he grew up knowing about
the traditional healers and was treated by one as a child.

Among the 80 to 90 healers in the CNMI and Guam, approximately 15 to 20 of them
have died during the past 5 years. There will be a shortage of healers if the knowl-
edge is not preserved or perpetuated as healers are dying.

Perpetuation of Healing Tradition
Many healers spoke of their difficulties in identifying a family member to whom
they would like to pass their knowledge and tradition. According to Demapan (2011),
the traditional healer aspirant must show interest and be recognized as wanting to
be a healer. However, finding these potential healers and future apprentices has
been challenging. Lizama (2014) conducted an interview with a Saipan healer,
who explained that he did not have children, and although his siblings had chil-
dren, they were still very young and did not show an interest. He observed that the
children were too consumed with TV, their iPad, and technology overall. He was
disheartened that they did not express an interest to learn. His mother told him
that he could only pass on the knowledge to another family member. He expressed
deep hurt because without another family member to pass on his knowledge to,
his valuable knowledge would die with him. The sentiment of this healer has been
a common theme of healers in Guam and in the CNMI. Many healers lament that
their children are consumed with other things or too busy to learn. A consequence
of this situation is that the healers no longer try to teach their children or grandchil-
dren if their attempts have been rejected. Although many of the “rules” are honored
and are continued by the healers, identifying someone at a young age to start
learning has been very difficult. If healers are not able to pass on the tradition to a
family member, then to whom will they pass on their knowledge? Technology and
modernization are obstacles in the way of recruiting and training young children
and family members. The impact of technology and modernization on the younger
generation as it affects traditional healing is significant. As a response to this impact
in Guam, an apprenticeship program has been developed. In Saipan and in Rota,
traditional healing is taught in the school system, and community gardens have
been established. These gardens contain medicinal plants that are used to teach
children at a young age and have been introduced into the school curriculum. This
instructional method differs from the traditional ways, as the learning of traditional
healing was previously done in the home. Now, the exposure to plants and healing
is done through the school curriculum.

Although a formal apprenticeship program exists in Guam, recruitment to be an
apprentice has been very difficult. In the past 5 years, there have been three appren-
tices and in 2021 the Guma Yo'åmte (House of Healers) has one apprentice. Much
time and commitment are required of an apprentice. The apprentice accompanies
the healer picking åmot and trains at the healing center, observing and being ob-
served. This requires the apprentice to be there at all times. The traditional healer
apprenticeship is very different from an internship or a practicum placement. An
internship has a set requirement of hours for completion. The current model of ap-
prenticeship in the healing center does not have a set number of hours; instead, the
healers will assess when the apprentice is ready. This can be a difficult time commit-
ment for many, as well as an economic hardship, as apprentices are not paid.

A cultural and social shift has begun, as some healers are now passing on their
knowledge to an “apprentice” outside of their family. However, not all healers agree
with this shift. Organized groups such as the Åmot Natibu in Saipan and the Håya
Foundation and Åmot Farm in Guam have joined together to support the healers,

hear their concerns, and help with the preservation and perpetuation of the tra-
ditional healing practices. The Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch
(IÅN/ASF) is a nonprofit organization formed in 2007 that advocates for, recognizes,
and supports traditional healers in the Marianas. Another goal of the IÅN/ASF is
to aid in the protection of medicinal plants and to document the healing tradition,
as much knowledge is passed on orally. One of the IÅN/ASF’s first major projects
was to provide the community with a comprehensive trilingual directory (English,
CHamoru, and Carolinian) of Indigenous traditional healers in the CNMI. This
project was the first documented directory and listed at least 45 traditional healers
who are living and currently practicing (although some may have passed since the
publication of the directory) in the CNMI. The healers were able to provide a brief
description of themselves, how they learned their craft, what their specialties are,
and even some recipes for certain ailments. The 700-page directory documents the
stories of 45 traditional healers in Saipan, Rota, and Tinian, who chose to be in-
cluded. This publication is significant in many ways because one of the rules for
healers is that they not publicize what they do, and this rule likely prevented many
healers from contributing to the publication. The Guam Council on the Arts and
Humanities Agency (CAHA) has been trying to establish a similar directory of heal-
ers, yet for years they have not been successful, possibly due to the traditional rule
prohibiting healers from advertising.

The Håya Foundation (2018) was established in Guam in 2005 to “enhance the
well-being of our people,” and in support of that mission they have worked on pre-
serving, promoting, and perpetuating our traditional healing practices. The Åmot
Farm is a preservation farm of medicinal native and introduced plants grown and
tended using organic methods. In addition, the Åmot Farm promotes and perpetu-
ates the healing practices by providing edu-tourism and ecotourism via farm tours.
Although the Håya Foundation and the Åmot Farm are two separate non-profit
entities, they work together with a common mission of preserving and perpetuating
traditional healing practices.

The Håya Foundation and the Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch
have worked together to address challenges facing our traditional healers. Three
Konfrensian Åmot [Conference for Medicinal Herbs] have been held and were very
successful. The primary role of these conferences is to bring together the healers so
that they can advocate for what they need help with and to educate others about the
state of traditional medicine.

There are many obstacles to the preservation and perpetuation of the traditional heal-
ing practices. As mentioned earlier, the knowledge was passed on from generation
to generation and yet today many of the children of the healers do not want to per-
petuate the tradition. Other obstacles include difficulty accessing medicinal plants
and herbs, economic hardship, fear of being exploited, and conflicting CHamoru
values, such as that between mamåhlao (humility) and banidosu/a (self-promotion).

In Guam and Saipan, new construction projects, such as hotels and other establish-
ments have involved the clearing of jungle areas, the natural habitat of many of the
medicinal plants. Consequently, finding herbs and plants has become increasing-
ly difficult. In Saipan, plants that grew in locations close to a healer are no longer
available, resulting in healers having to do more traveling or hiking through rough
terrain to gain access to the herbs they need to treat patients. A problem that directly
impacts Guam is that many of the herbs grow in lush environments controlled by
the military. Some of these lands cannot be accessed by healers, and those who do
have access need to provide a reason for entry and must produce the appropriate
paperwork. A healer from Saipan who was living in Guam shared his story of how
he was told that he could get all the medicinal herbs that he needed at Ritidian (a
wildlife refuge). He made his way to Ritidian and saw the herbs he needed to treat
a patient. He started to collect them but was confronted by a preservation officer
who told him that he could not just pick whatever he wanted and that he must get
a pass. The healer argued with the preservation officer, declaring that this land be-
longs to the people and that he needs the medicine to treat a person. He was almost
arrested, and by the time the issue was resolved, it was too late to pick the herbs he
needed (according to the rules of when to pick medicine). Feeling sad, the healer
left knowing that he could not help the patient until the next day. He also felt angry
that he could not access the jungle. He did not experience such obstacles accessing
restricted lands in Saipan.

Healers in Rota and Tinian, when asked if they had problems collecting the åmot
or having access, stated that they generally did not have any difficulties gathering
the medicine. They complained, however, that many young people do not recognize

the difference between medicinal plants/herbs and weeds, so when doing yard work
or bush cutting, they inadvertently kill the plants. The older healers explained that
some plants flourish in their natural habitats in the valley, near water, or near rocky
environments and can be difficult to access, as the healers are not as fit as they used
to be. Thus, while access to traditional plants in Saipan is not quite as obstructed
as in Guam, in general, access has become constrained by various means and to
various degrees in all the islands in the Marianas.

Additional Dynamics at Work Today
When asked where they obtained their healing power, many of the healers re-
sponded that it was a gift from God. Some said that the spirits also guided them.
As mentioned earlier, a healer must adhere to traditional rules; one in particular
stipulates that a healer should never take money as a form of payment. Demapan’s
(2011) interviews with healers revealed that most do not charge for treatment.
Traditionally, in gratitude for the healer’s help, an individual or family will leave
gifts of appreciation. These gifts can take the form of a case of frozen chicken, a
sack of rice, or fresh fruits, vegetables, or fish. Whatever the patient gives out of the
kindness of the heart should be accepted.

When I asked healers about accepting money as payment, there were several differ-
ing opinions. Many healers said they accepted anything but money. Some explained
that instead of money, they tell the patient to take the money and offer Mass in-
tentions at church. One healer questioned the difference between taking a case of
spareribs versus accepting money. Why could he not take the money and buy what
is needed? He noted that in the past, there may not have been a need for money, but
in modern times, the need exists.

A commonality among the healers in the CNMI and Guam is that healers will
accept whatever a patient gives. If the patient cannot give anything, that is also fine.
The healers feel that they received the healing gift from God and that they should
not charge. Many believe that if they charge, the healing would not work, and the
patient would not be helped. For healers who were open to accepting money, they
had one rule: the money could not be given directly to them and either had to be
left on the table or on another object. These healers also believe that a healer could
not name a price or have a set price list, unlike massage establishments, which post
price lists for a 30-minute massage, a 60-minute massage, etc. These healers feel that
if a person wants to pay in cash, it is up to the individual to determine how much
they want to give, so long as it is from the kindness of their heart.

Another change that has been observed is that for centuries, healers have practiced
out of their homes, their natural habitat. This is still very true for the CNMI, but there
have been some changes in Guam. For example, in May 2016, the Guma Yo'åmte was
established because many in the community wanted access to a healer, but did not
know where to find one. Traditionally, healers do not advertise and are located by
word of mouth. Today, there are three healers who practice full-time at the Guma
Yo'åmte and two who practice part-time in addition to conducting home visits.

This shift marks a change, since healers did not usually go to patients’ homes
unless it was a spiritual issue that required them to såffe the person’s home and
other belongings. The two healers who conduct home visits receive many requests
from those who have had strokes or more serious health conditions that prevent
them from being transported by car to Guma Yo'åmte. Having a house of healers
and healers who do home visits is different from what has been practiced in the
past. However, these practices are necessary to improve access to care provided by
traditional healers. Now that some healers are conducting home visits, concerns
over the need and cost of gas have emerged, leading to questions of whether these
healers should charge a fee for costs incurred when conducting home visits. When
asked about charging for gas, the healers responded by saying, “Whatever people
want to give.” With further inquiry, one of the healers commented, “It always works
out. For example, someone will give $20, someone will give $0, and then someone
gives $100. I don’t worry about it because it always works out.”

The popularity of a centralized healing center, the Guma Yo'åmte, is represented
in several charts below, which show the utilization of the services that the Guma
Yo'åmte provided from May 2016 until June 2017. Originally the Guma Yo'åmte was
only open Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and half day on Saturdays. However,
the response from the community has been phenomenal. Due the demand, as of
September 2017, they are open every day except Sunday. The chart below (Figure 1)
shows that the Guma Yo'åmte has had about 1,999 visitors between May 2016 when it
opened, and June 2017, averaging about 143 visitors a month. Some are repeat visitors
because most treatments require that patients be tended to for 3 days in a row.

Note. Data comes from the visitor’s log. Total number of visitors is 1,999. Average monthly number of visitors is 143.

The chart below (Figure 2) displays the age of female visitors and the problems
for which they sought treatment at the Guma Yo'åmte within a particular month.
The healers were sought out for the following: såffe, massage, chotge, and there
were two other categories for unspecified and other problems. It should be noted
that the demographic information is limited. Although the Guma Yo'åmte had
the forms available, no one was ensuring that patients were filling out the forms
completely. If a patient completed a form, it was appreciated, but it was not of
great concern if they did not. Greater efforts are now being taken to encourage the
completion of forms by patients.

Figure 2
Age and Requested Service of a Selection of Female Visitors to Guma Yo'åmte


Note: Data comes from intake forms. Total number of female visitors in this particular month was 108.


From the information collected, 108 females filled out the intake form. These fe-
males ranged in age from under 12 to over 75. The majority of patients were seen
for massage, with the exception of those under the age of 12, who were seen for
chotge. Chotge is a method used for newborns, infants, and young children where
the åmot is put into a cloth and squeezed into the child’s mouth. This type of åmot
and method is used for children who have a lot of congestion, a bad cold, or are
coughing. The method is commonly used for newborns who may have ingested
amniotic fluid, or who may need to clear their system of any food or toxins from the
mother. For example, if a child has skin problems, the healer may tell the mother
that she might have consumed too many spicy foods while pregnant, which may
have caused the child’s skin problems. The unspecified or other categories could
mean that patients came for reasons such as the flu, pneumonia, fertility concerns,
menstruation, or menopause.

The results were very similar for the male patients (Figure 3). There were 70 male
patients who filled out the demographic form. These patients also ranged in age
from under 12 to over 75. Many of the patients came for a massage, with the exception

of patients under the age of 12, who came for chotge and massage. There were also
many patients who came for other ailments such as the såffe. The unspecified or
other categories could mean that they came for conditions such as the flu, pneumo-
nia, sprains, or back problems.

Figure 3
Age and Requested Service of a Selection of Male Visitors to Guma Yo'åmte


Note. Data comes from intake forms. Total number of male visitors in this particular month was 70.


Five patients did not fill out the gender portion of the form. One person between
the ages of 35 to 44 sought help for såffe, and another between the ages of 45 to 54
sought massage. Two visitors under the age of 12 and another patient between 12-and
17-years-old indicated “other.” Although there have not been many demographic
forms completed by this particular group, it is clear that overall, many people are
seeking the services of a traditional healer. The demand for traditional healing ser-
vices is quite high. Based on observations by healers and conversations with them,
all age groups are utilizing the services of the healers.

Conclusions
The practice of traditional healing has continued in the Marianas despite strug-
gles with preservation and perpetuation. However, in order for traditional healing
practices to survive, a new model of practice has been developed. This new model
involves a centralized location where healers can practice, as well as the develop-
ment of an apprenticeship system for those interested in learning but who may
not be from a family of traditional healers. Some healers still practice out of their
homes, and most healers—both in the home and at the Guma Yo'åmte—still honor
the traditional rules of picking åmot and respect. Another change has been the
communication between healers within formal settings, such as within meetings
and at conferences. Healers have redefined what “advertising” or “publicizing”
their services mean; they now speak publicly at school sites, are present at fairs,
and conduct demonstrations at public events. They also attend conferences that
deal with healing and have increased their public presence. The examples above
are changes that are being made among Guam healers. In January 2018, at the Third
Konfrensian Åmot, healers from the CNMI echoed the sentiments of healers from
Guam and expressed their desire for the establishment of a healing center. Healers
from Saipan and Rota have sought assistance from the Håya Foundation to open
healing centers in Saipan and Rota. The Håya Foundation will work closely with the
Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch to help develop healing centers
in Saipan, Rota, and eventually, Tinian. The island groups have agreed to tackle the
threat of extinction of traditional healing practices if there is not a mechanism in
place for preservation. The Saipan healers would like to be next in opening a heal-
ing center in collaboration with healers from Rota. As an additional collaborative
effort, the healers facilitated a CHamoru immersion camp in the summer of 2017 to
teach 40 youths ages 14 and up about traditional CHamoru practices, including, but
not limited to, fishing, weaving, and storytelling. While there are still distinct differ-
ences among the Mariana Islands and some debate over how the practice should
be passed on, it is universally agreed that the practice is deeply embedded in the
CHamoru culture and must be passed on. If the methods described above do not
continue and apprentices are not trained, a crisis will occur as at least 25% of the
healers interviewed have already passed away from 2014 to 2020.

Fanachu Famalåo’an: Women are Emerging as Leaders in the Community-wide Resistance to Militarization in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Sylvia C. Frain)

Digital, legal, political, and spiritual resistance to escalating militarization in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (hereafter CNMI) is currently
unfolding across the archipelago.³² Chamorro and Refaluwasch (Carolinian)
women and women-led organizations are resisting through online petitions, soli-
darity videos, and federal lawsuits. The context of the resistance relates directly to
the United States Department of Defenseʼs (hereafter DOD) latest Draft/Overseas
Environmental Impact Statement released in April 2015, The Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training.

The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training
In April 2015, The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training
(CJMT) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) / Overseas Environmental
Impact Statement (OEIS) document was released. This 1,400-page document pro-
poses the creation of Live-Fire Training Range Complexes (LFTRCs) on Pågan and
Tinian islands, the use of the beaches for amphibious landings, and the sea around

the islands for war exercises and sonar testing.³³ The US Navy wants Tinian for 20
weeks of live-fire training and 22 weeks a year of non-live activity, including muni-
tions storage, danger zones, and airspace and seaspace restrictions (Figure 1). The
military wants to employ the island of Pågan as a high-level bombing range for ex-
ercises from the land, air, and sea, including “guns-blazing war games” for at least 16
weeks a year (Cloud, 2015). However, the CJMT document includes the possibility of
such activity for 40 weeks per year in Pågan and 45 weeks in Tinian (Hofschneider,
2016b). The current surge in women’s resistance to these plans is evident through
online petitions, solidarity videos, and court cases (Frain, 2017).

jointmilitarytrainingeis.com/documents). Copyright 2015 by Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific.

During the negotiations that began in 1972 for the “Covenant to Establish a
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the
United States,” the US Navy announced it needed to establish a $300 million joint
Air Force-Navy airfield, a multi-service airbase, a logistics supply depot, a marine
amphibious training center, and an over-the-horizon radar facility in Tinian. The
DOD wanted to “lease” the entire island of Tinian. The residents were promised
US military base jobs, education for their children in base schools, use of the hospi-
tal, and other benefits. But the promises relating to the benefits for the community
never came to fruition. The joint-base plan was never implemented, nor was the
school or hospital (Hofschneider, 2016b). Many saw this not as true self-determina-
tion; rather, the “United States, needing to ensure their military objectives, rigged
the Commonwealth Covenant plebiscite” (Dé Ishtar, 1994, p. 93).

The Covenant Agreement offers two sections for interaction between local CNMI
political leaders on the one hand, and the DOD and the US federal government
on the other. Both the Military Technical Agreement (MTA) relating to the military
lease for Tinian and “Section 902” permit consultations and discussions between
the CNMI leadership and the US DOI to (re)assess “all matters affecting the rela-
tionship between them” (Villahermosa, 2016a). In June 2016, Governor Ralph Deleon
Guerrero Torres traveled to Washington, DC for the Covenant 902 talks with the
Department of the Interior (DOI) and the DOD (Hofschneider, 2016b). Speaking to
the DOD personally regarding the proposed CJMT document, he stated, “We have
an existing contract. That needs to be fulfilled before you start proposing anything
else. That’s what we want. Nothing more, nothing else” (Chan, 2016). Torres referred
to the MTA as the “existing contract.” In addition, Torres wrote in a letter to Lt. Gen.
Anthony Crutchfield, the DOD’s current point of contact, in which he asserted that
prior programmatic agreements “with the military should move forward first before
another agreement is signed” (Villahermosa, 2016b).

Today’s resistance to the militarization of the islands is met with the DOD response
that the residents “knew about their military obligations when they voted for the
Marianas Commonwealth Covenant.” When challenged about past “unfulfilled
promises” made by the DOD and previous agreements, the (now former) Marine
Forces Pacific Executive Director, Craig B. Whelden, claims that he “does not know
what happened 30 or 40 years ago” (Zotomayor, 2015c, p. 4). The contemporary

situation is further complicated because the LFTRC plans for Tinian and Pågan
islands are contingent on the relocation of the 5,000 Marines and their dependents
to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Tinian and Pågan islands become LFTRCs,
while Guam provides the housing and an additional LFTRC.

The resistance is complex, especially as the population of the CNMI serves in the
US military at extremely high rates. The forms of resistance demonstrate an under-
standing that the “US military” is not one monolithic organization, but it is diverse.
Indigenous residents proudly serve in the US Armed Forces, while at the same time
they want to “protect and defend” their sacred lands and seas from becoming Live
Fire Training Range Complexes: “We definitely support our military’s needs to train
and be ready, but please do not destroy our homes in [the] process” (Hofschneider,
2016a). The women leading the resistance also reiterate how they are not “anti-mil-
itary,” but demand that the DOD explain unfulfilled commitments and uphold
previous agreements, before drafting new agreements and making additional prom-
ises to the community (T. Sablan, personal communication, July 9, 2016).

Although the projects are interconnected and interdependent, the DOD has re-
leased six Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) documents at various stages as if
they are separate projects. This tactic of “unbundling” and detaching is the focus of a
lawsuit recently filed in the federal court in Saipan and discussed in the final section
of this chapter (Ngata, 2016). While the CNMI is considered “America’s best-kept
secret” by the tourism industry, it is also considered US “soil” by the DOD, which
can potentially exercise eminent domain in the name of “national security” to use
the land, sea, and air for military purposes (Ortigas, 2016; Villahermosa, 2016c).

The Community Responds During the Public Comment Period 2015
After the release of this large and highly technical CJMT document, and as required
by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the US military provided only 30
to 90 days for the public to submit written or verbal comments from elected officials,
governmental agencies, private-sector institutions, businesses, community organi-
zations and the general public (Zotomayor, 2015a).³⁴ During this period, the DOD
held (and controlled) “culturally inappropriate open-house style public meetings” at
schools in Saipan and Tinian, some of which were poorly attended. Four Chamorro
and Refaluwasch scholars and residents outlined how the EIS “public meeting”
forum is culturally incompatible with Chamorro and Refaluwasch methods of gath-
ering community input and feedback.³⁵ They discuss how reciprocal culture creates
generous hosts, but there are “obligations and proper etiquette for the guests,” for
example, a US government agency like the military (Cabrera et al., 2015). Within the
framework of being a “good guest,” the authors discuss how to properly and respect-
fully gather input from the community and the importance of oral culture. “Good
Guests” do not ask for “more than they should receive given the relationship history
and the reciprocal obligations tied to that request” (Cabrera et al., 2015).

Numerous residents are also US Armed Forces veterans, and they spoke at these
meetings of their experience of “protecting and defending” US interests abroad, and
how they are now resisting the destruction of their homeland. Veteran Francella
Kaipat Reyes delivered her testimony with her daughter Natasha by her side. As
described by her auntie:
     When she raised her right hand and swore to protect and defend her coun-
     try and her people, she did so with no questions asked. And she endured the
     painful sacrifice of leaving her daughter motherless for 13 months while she
     was deployed overseas. She told us her feet touched the sands (and grounds) of
     Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote places that’s [sic] hard for us to pronounce,
     let alone spell. Through it all, she gave her all and served as a loyal, patriotic
     daughter of the CNMI, serving her people and country. Today, she adds her plea
     to the chorus of voices asking for Uncle Sam not to destroy Pågan. (Kaipat, 2015)
Peace activist, Director of Community Building with the Micronesian Climate
Change Alliance, teacher, and mother, Moñeka De Oro provided testimony at the
CJMT Public Meeting held at Tinian Junior Senior High School on April 30, 2015 (on
the same date as the popular Tinian Fiesta, a community event that nearly all 3,500
residents attend). In a video of her testimony posted on Alternative Zero Coalition's
(2015) Facebook page, De Oro proclaimed,
     As a Chamoru, I would be remiss if I didn’t teach my students about the
     4,000-year-old history and how our ancestors have fought hard over the last
     500 years against foreign domination to keep our islands, our language, and
     our culture alive. We need to still honor them here today. As a Peace Activist, I
     would be remiss if I didn’t teach my students that in the 239 years of American
     history, 222 of those years have been fighting wars and in conflicts all over the
     world. And Chamorros, Carolinians [Refaluwasch], and Micronesians have

    been fighting, suffering and dying in these wars. And we STILL can’t vote for
    a president! Enough is enough! Not one bomb, not one bullet in our islands!
    I would be remiss if I didn’t tell my students that there is a better way. Our an-
    cestors knew a better way. They knew something that the American forefathers
    never knew. Something that the American consume-and-waste economy does
    not know. That we are all one!
At the EIS meetings, these women (one a soldier, the other a teacher, and both
mothers) highlighted “protecting” and “defending,” while honoring the ancestors
and the genealogy of resistance to keep the islands, language, and culture alive.
The soldier vowed to protect and defend her people and country and served in the
US military overseas. However, when she returned, “Uncle Sam” wanted to destroy
her homeland. The teacher alluded to honoring the ancestors, whose knowledge is
4,000 years old—much older than the US “ideals” of democracy and freedom that
come at the expense of the people of the Marianas and that are required parts of the
curriculum in the local schools.

Despite the recurring release of numerous “lengthy, technical, complex American
English-language documents that refer to one another, which have been 11,000,
4,000, and 1,500 pages long,” CNMI residents, including politicians, and even US
federal agencies, have expressed strong opposition to the expanding militarization
(Cabrera et al., 2015). A record number of nearly 30,000 written comments opposing
the project were submitted during the public response period, closing on October
2, 2015 (Hofschneider, 2016d). Residents and their supporters continue to voice their
concerns through letters to the editors of the local newspapers, the Marianas Variety
and the Saipan Tribune (Dayao, 2015a; Dayao, 2015b; Frain, 2015; Zotomayor, 2015b).
Local residents question the necessity of using their limited landmass and waters
for high impact, live-fire training purposes. Cinta M. Kaipat (2015), a Chamorro and
Refaluwasch attorney who was born on Agrigan, an island north of her childhood
home of Pågan, and who currently resides in Saipan, asked, “how would they [the
military] like it if this was done in their backyard? If they need to do this training so
badly, why not in California, Washington [State], or Texas?”

Legal Response by Dentons Environmental Science Associates
In addition to the public hearings and a record number of written comments submit-
ted, many CNMI politicians have also voiced opposition to the further militarization
of the archipelago. In April 2015, shortly after the release of the CJMT proposal, the
Federal and Foreign Affairs Committee in the Marianas House voted 19-0 in favor of
a resolution introduced by the late Governor Inos to “oppose any and all proposed
military use of Pågan” (Cloud, 2015). The House Committee on Federal and Foreign
Affairs Chair, Representative Angel Demapan, referred to Guam’s experience with
the DOD and to a successful lawsuit, which saved the sacred Pågat village from be-
coming an LFTRC. Representative Demapan stated,
     The [US] military used the same tactics with the people of Guam when they
     tried to build a base in a Chamorro village which the people of Guam opposed.
     You would think after the military’s experience with Guam that they would
     learn, but it appears that they didn’t learn and they are treating us the same way
     and with the same tactics that they imposed on the people of Guam. But we will
     remain vigilant and we will fight for our position. (Villahermosa, 2015)
In support of this stance, the CNMI administration hired a team of legal experts,
Dentons Environmental Science Associates (hereafter Dentons), to review the “legal
adequacy” of the CJMT proposal on behalf of the CNMI government. They found it
“fails to meet even the most basic requirements … and the limited evidence present-
ed in the document suggests that the CJMT would violate both federal and CNMI
law” (Dentons US LLP Environmental Science Associates, 2015). Attorney Nicholas
Yost of Dentons reassured the CNMI that “no one is above the law and that includes
the military.” Attorney Matthew Adams, also with Dentons, added that the DEIS
lacks “alternatives, impact analysis, mitigation, and public input” and concluded,
based on these initial findings, that the CJMT is “non-compliant with the basic prin-
ciples of the NEPA” (Kedi & Scaliem, 2015, p. 3).³⁶

An Environmental Commitment Example: Chiget Mortar Range
For the past 5 years, Tinian mayors, CNMI governors, and local historians have issued
numerous requests for the DOD to clean up the Chiget Mortar Range. Tinian Mayor,
Joey P. San Nicolas, continuously demands this must happen before Tinian considers
the construction of additional LFTRCs (Chan, 2015a; Chan 2015b; Zotomayor, 2015c).
The 97.5-acre Chiget Mortar artillery range was used or live-fire training from 1945-
1994 and remains a military “scar” and a “dudded impact area.” It is contaminated with
chromium and iron, exceeding the 2008 Guam Environmental Protection Agency
Pacific Basin Environment Screening Levels for groundwater that is a current or po-
tential source of drinking water (Chan, 2015b). Located next to the popular tourist

site, the Tinian Blow Hole, the range has remained closed. This serves as an example
of what happens to a “high-impact area,” such as those outlined in the CJMT. For
those resisting militarization, it demonstrates an additional unfulfilled commitment
by the DOD. Women’s resistance in Tinian maintains that they are not “unpatriotic”
or “un-American,” and in fact, “We believed in America,” but historical (in)actions
by both the US federal government and the DOD show otherwise (Hofschneider,
2016d).³⁷ The ongoing environmental degradation is an everyday aspect of militariza-
tion that fuels the women’s legal, political, and spiritual resistance.

Military Technical Agreement, Section 802
Commonly referred to as the “MTA,” the Military Technical Agreement Article 8:
Property, Section 802, Id.§104, states that, “property will be made available to the
Government of the United States by lease to enable it to carry out its defense respon-
sibilities” (Willens & Siemer, 2002). In addition, the MTA outlines the perimeters of
the military lease and use of land in Saipan, Tinian, and No'os (Farrallon de Medinilla,
FDM) islands. The 1970s lease value of the land and waters immediately adjacent to
Tinian was determined at $17.5 million US (approximately $74 million today), while
the entire island and waters surrounding No'os (Farrallon de Medinilla, FDM) were
valued at $20,600 US (approximately $86,000 today) (Farrell, 1991, p. 595). The MTA
instructs the US to “recognize” and “respect” that the people “need, depend upon
and cherish their very limited land,” of 184 square miles (Taitano, 2015). However, the
extent of this recognition is unclear, and many are concerned that the US military
may still use the principle of eminent domain and claim “national security” to push
the militarization plans, while disregarding the Covenant Agreement.

Save Tinian #SaveTinian
While the MTA outlines the structure of the lease, including the acreage, price, and
activities the military may conduct, the exploitation of Tinian for an LFTRC and the
use of live fire are in direct violation of the Covenant Agreement. The planned con-
struction of an LFTRC will degrade land, destroy acres of coral, and put residents
at risk of death and injury from stray ordnance. Furthermore, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) is concerned that the planned construction will pollute the
Tinian aquifer, the only groundwater source for its 3,100 residents (Hofschneider,
2016b).³⁸ The late Eloy Inos, the 8th Governor of the CNMI, stated it would “violate
the terms and spirit of the original Tinian land lease agreement” (Chan, 2015a).

Members of the Tinian Women’s Association (hereafter TWA), a non-profit group
dedicated to preserving the Chamorro culture and advocating for Tinian women
and children, submitted comments to the Navy’s environmental review and passed
out informational flyers to inform local residents. Deborah Fleming, who was a
child during the formation of the Covenant and is now a spokeswoman for TWA,
said that when two-thirds of Tinian was leased by the US military in the 1970s, “use
of the island as a firing range was never discussed, and elders would not have agreed
to this. It is as far beyond” what local communities agreed to when they participated
in the political status plebiscite. Fleming continued, “Now we’re presented with a
totally different picture of using our island as a bombing range which we oppose
because the plan fails to identify what those effects are, so that our people are aware
about exactly what is happening” (Radio New Zealand, 2016). TWA member Florine
Hofschneider said in a media statement, “We refuse to accept the Navy’s plan to
subject our children to nearly constant bombardment” (Jones, 2016).³⁹ The women’s
legal resistance is based on the MTA, while their political resistance is interwoven
with the local politicians’ efforts and abilities as structured through the Covenant
902 talks. As Ms. Fleming stated, “We believed in America. Instead what they want
to do is destroy our island” (Hofschneider, 2016d).

While maintaining that they are not “anti-military” or “anti-American,” local res-
idents assert that the military must at least fulfill past promises. They believe that
neither live-fire bombing in Tinian nor the use of Pågan were included in the
Covenant Agreement. They question the necessity of using their limited landmass
and waters for high impact, live-fire training purposes.

Save Pågan #SavePagan
The MTA outlined the lease for two-thirds of Tinian, and all of No'os; however,
it never mentioned any additional islands, including Pågan island. The US Navy
considers Pågan the “perfect” diverse training location. Its aim includes “tank ma-
neuvers, amphibious landings, land mines, grenade launchers, rockets, mortars,
missiles, shells, and air-dropped bombs up to 1000 pounds” from B-52s, drones,
helicopters, and fighter jets (Chamorro.com, 2016). The black sand beaches are large
enough for “amphibious landings and trainings” with fleets of warships (US Marine
Corps Forces Pacific, 2015). The former executive director of Marine Corps forces in
the Pacific claims that “We would protect it like it was our own” (Cloud, 2015).

Homestead Program
According to the late Northern Islands Mayor, Jerome Kaipat Aldan, the Chamorro
people’s history on Pågan goes back to the 1300s, and despite forced relocation
by Spanish, German, Japanese, and US colonizers, the ancestral connections
remain strong to the volcanic and resource-rich island and waters surrounding it
(Hofschneider, 2016c).⁴⁰ For over 30 years, more than 50 families who consider Pågan
home have planned and are eager to return to the homesteads (Cave, 2015). It is this
community of residents, led by women, who are instrumental in the digital, legal,
political, and spiritual resistance. The former residents who remain in Saipan have
formed coalitions and consistently advocate for the implementation of a homestead
program, which will grant homestead lots to former residents (Todiño, 2014).

Women’s Resistance
Three women-led organizations based in the CNMI are involved in the resistance,
each with varying focuses and goals. The community group, Tinian Women’s
Association, cites the DOD’s unfulfilled past commitments and previous agree-
ments as the source of their legal and political resistance. The Guardians of Gani'
spiritually resist militarization to protect the sensitive and unique environments
of the Northern Mariana Islands, and honor the genealogical connection to the
archipelago. Digital resistance by Alternative Zero Coalition employs new media
technologies to foster fluidarity and seek to control the future development of Pågan,
as former residents express their desire to return home (Figure 2).

Through similar avenues used in Guam to counter the initial military “build-up”
announcement, CNMI women are employing digital, legal, political, and spiritual
forms of resistance. First, an online petition gathered international support with
over 120,000 signatures and (inter)national media coverage. Second, the young
women in Guam filmed and shared a solidary YouTube video, encouraging others
to #jointhemovement. Third, a lawsuit was filed in July 2016 accusing the DOD of
failing to create one complete EIS document or explore potential alternative lo-
cations. Finally, the resistance efforts are grounded in the spiritual connection to
the seascape, supported by matriarchal principles, and shared on digital platforms
through hashtags such as #SaveTinian #SavePagan and #JoinTheMovement.

As the community waits for additional EIS documents to be released by the DOD,
women-led community organizations, along with a woman attorney from Tinian
working with Earthjustice, filed a lawsuit against the DOD with the federal court
in Saipan. The Northern Islands Mayor’s Office created a CNMI Northern Islands
Facebook page to highlight the beauty of the islands, and for other users to share
their stories and visualize the connection. Arley Long from Tinian created the let-
ter,“DO NOT use the inhabited US islands of Tinian and Pågan as a HIGH IMPACT
bombing range” on the online petitioning platform, Change.org (Figure 3). Long’s
letter petitioned the legal and political “decision makers,” including the DOD, in
which the islanders have no input; the President of the United States, who they
cannot vote for; the United States House of Representatives, in which they have a
nonvoting delegate; and the United States Senate, in which they are without repre-
sentation. Within a number of weeks, the petition gathered 121,454 signatures from
across the globe, and stories were featured in The Guardian and in the US military
publication, Stars and Stripes (McCurry, 2015; Olson, 2015).⁴¹ Garnering this much
overseas attention reveals that is not due to lack of interest that people beyond the
archipelago are not involved, but rather that their political representatives and the
(inter)national media fail to inform them.

of-defense-do-not-use-the-inhabited-us-islands-of-tinian-pagan-as-a-high-impact-bombing-range).


As an online petition platform, Change.org allows for “petition updates” to provide
up-to-date information regarding a cause, as well as comments from those virtually
signing a petition.⁴² There are debates regarding the “success” of online petitions,
with some scholars criticizing “clicktivism” for not translating into real political or
social action or movements beyond the digital realm (Johnson, 2011). Others maintain
that “hashtag activism” and “digital technologies have imbued everyday citizen-
ship with more power than ever before” (Karpf, 2015, p. 61). In this case, the online
petition did lead to real action and inspired the people of the Mariana Islands to
know that thousands of people beyond the archipelago signed on in solidarity.⁴³ The
“one response” from the decision makers came from Representative Mike Honda
of California, who is Chair Emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American
Caucus. Representative Honda expressed his support for the digital petition, and he
commented on how the House of Representatives considered the National Defense
Authorization Act in June of 2015:
     My good friend Delegate Gregorio Kilili Sablan from CNMI offered an
     amendment that would have required the Department of Defense to reach an
     agreement with the Government of the Northern Marianas on the nature and
     scope of activities before any funds could be expended for expanded military
     activities in the Northern Mariana Islands … I voted in support of the amend-
     ment. Unfortunately, it was defeated by a vote of 173-256. (Honda, 2015)
Although the online petition has since closed, the site contains comments from sig-
natories, media updates, and links to share on new media platforms. The women
protectors and defenders believe that the more people know about the Marianas
archipelago, the more likely the resistance will result in stopping the Pacific pivot in
the Marianas. This is an era of Indigenous resistance, such as defenders of Mauna
Kea, the 4,200-meter-high volcano on the Big Island of Hawai‘i and digitalized as
#WeAreMaunaKea, which (so far) has halted the construction of an additional
telescope, and the water protectors at Standing Rock, North Dakota, resisting the
“black snake” of oil pipelines with #NoDAPL and #WaterIsLife (Ngata, 2016; NYC
Stands with Standing Rock Collective, 2016). Sharing and honoring sacred rights in
one place helps to inspire solidarity with others struggling elsewhere. Digitally, the
protectors in Oceania and the continental US embody the reciprocal connection
between the sacred environment and themselves.

In 2015, the History and Culture of Guam class at the Academy of Our Lady of
Guam, launched a “video campaign in solidarity with the rest of the Marianas [sic]
Islands” to support their sisters in the north. The students created the three-min-
ute video, Guahan in Solidarity with Tinian and Pagan, stating, “The United States
military has made plans to use our islands as live-fire ranges without consenting
[sic] the Indigenous people that inhabit these precious islands.” The short video
opens with dramatic music and beautiful imagery of Tinian and Pågan islands, and
then abruptly cuts to President Obama giving a speech, representing the 2011 “Asia
Pacific Pivot” announcement he gave in Australia. The first minute includes archi-
val footage of US flags and soldiers marching, as well as explosive live-fire military
bombings and amphibious landings, analogous to those proposed for Tinian and
Pågan. A news correspondent with a non-American accent narrates, stating, “the US
military has not taken Indigenous and cultural factors into account. The military
plans to lease the ‘uninhibited island’ in its entirety so the Navy, Army, Air Force,

and Marines can carry out live-fire trainings.” They contrast the colonial-military
imagery with a young woman on the beach waving the Guam flag.

The juxtaposition of imagery is understood as the imperial ideologies pushed by
the US federal government and the DOD. Framed as “national defense,” the im-
agery includes symbols of empire—flags, military weapons, and troops. As the
music shifts to relaxing instrumental, a dozen young women line up on the beach,
representing a more sacred and Indigenous approach to social systems. Joining
hands, the women express unity and solidarity with their sisters in the islands to
the north. They display the signs: “� Pågan,” “Prutehi yan Difendi,” and “Protect
and Defend Pågan and Tinian,” “Our Islands Are Sacred,” and “We Stand with
Pågan and Tinian.” The final scene shows the young women all coming together
at the main intersection in downtown Tumon Bay, the tourist district. They include
the hashtag #WeStandWithPåganandTinian. The video ends with the hashtag
#OurIslandsAreSacred and encourages the viewers to “Join the Movement” to pro-
tect Pågan and Tinian (see Figure 4). As of October 2021, the video has over 14,448
views and has gained support globally.⁴⁴

Similar themes from the resistance in Guam are shared throughout the archi-
pelago. Such resistance often references the Inifresi, the Chamorro pledge,
through the phrase “prutehi yan difendi.” The symbols of solidarity included in
the #OurIslandsAreSacred #WeStandWithPaganandTinian hashtags, link the
movements across the archipelago, both digitally and culturally. Arley Long,
the mother who created the online petition in Tinian, included the link to the
YouTube video under “updates” on the Change.org online petition as well.

It is through digital and community resistance that Chamorro and Refaluwasch
women of the Mariana Islands foster transoceanic fluidarity and visualize an alter-
native decolonized and demilitarized future for themselves and generations to come.
The resistance in the Mariana archipelago navigates within Indigenous collective
cultural frameworks and adapts digital technologies and new media platforms.

Legal Resistance: Suing the US Department of Defense
The final section of this chapter analyzes future possibilities, as women-led com-
munity groups filed a lawsuit against the DOD in the United States District Court
for the CNMI in Saipan in July 2016 (Figure 5). Kimberlyn King-Hinds is the local
attorney working with the environmental law organization, Earthjustice. In addi-
tion to gathering community support, King-Hinds has the support of CNMI elected
officials, including the Mayor of Tinian, the Governor of the CNMI, and the late
Mayor Aldan of the CNMI, who was the first to oppose the live-fire training (Perez,
2016). The women-led legal resistance and the filing of a lawsuit against the US Navy
and DOD in the federal court in Saipan are specifically related to the ten years of
EIS documents released since The United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation Agreement announcement of 2006, culminating with the CJMT
document released in 2015.

Post, by B. Manabat, 2022. https://www.postguam.com/news/cnmi/court-affirms-dismissal-of-lawsuit-against-
dod-navy/article_112e0caa-fbdb-11ea-8a3f-df0ce44bc0b1.html


The lawsuit accuses the US Navy and the DOD of failing to produce one concise
EIS report, a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The
second complaint is similar to the 2010 case in Guam in which residents success-
fully sued. The DOD has not considered any alternative locations for high-impact
LFTRCs, which could potentially cause less harm (Hofschneider, 2016b).

The Law Office of Kimberlyn King-Hinds (F0495) of San Jose Village, Tinian, filed
Civil No. 16-00022 in the United States District Court for the CNMI in Saipan on
behalf of the following organizations: the Tinian Women’s Association, Guardians
of Gani', PaganWatch, and the Center for Biological Diversity. The listed defen-
dants include: the United States Department of the Navy; Ray Mabus, Secretary of
the Navy; the United States Department of Defense; and Ashton Carter, Secretary
of Defense. The plaintiffs are claiming that the Navy violated the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 USC. §§ 4321 et seq., when it failed to evaluate
the environmental effects of military tests in an initial Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) relating to the permanent stationing of thousands of United States
Marines on the island of Guåhan and the proposal to conduct live-fire training for
those Marines on the islands of Tinian and Pågan in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), as related to the Pacific pivot foreign policy.
According to the complaint, the Navy failed to
     Evaluate in a single environmental impact statement (EIS) the impacts of both
     permanent stationing of Marines on Guam and the training on Tinian and
     Pågan the Navy claims those Marines will need to perform their national se-
     curity mission. In addition to segmenting illegally the environmental review of
     its Guam and CNMI Military Relocation project, the Navy further violated its
     NEPA duties when it refused to consider alternative locations outside of the
     Mariana Islands where the Marines could accomplish their mission with fewer
     adverse impacts. (King-Hinds, 2016)
The Navy is in violation of the NEPA by failing to evaluate the “connected actions”
between the build-up in Guam and the training in the CNMI or to evaluate the im-
pacts of the proposed training at the same time into a single EIS. Therefore, the
plaintiffs asked the court to have the 2010 and 2015 Records of Decision (hereafter
ROD) regarding the Marine relocation from Okinawa to the Mariana Islands vacat-
ed and set aside. Earthjustice attorney, David Henkin, who, along with Tinian-based
attorney Kimberlyn King-Hinds, represents the plaintiffs, reminded the media that
the “Navy has made a decision to move 5,000 Marines and their families to Guam
without considering all the alternatives or whether Guam can absorb that many
people in such a short time” (Pang, 2016).⁴⁵

If the ROD were removed, it would halt the build-up on Guåhan as well, since the
projects are in fact dependent on each other, despite the DOD sidestepping that
claim (Dumat-ol Daleno, 2016). Craig Whelden, formerly of Marine Corps Forces
Pacific, said the plans to boost the presence of Marines in Guam and increase train-
ing in the CNMI were separate. “They are not directly related, they are indirectly
related,” he said. “Marines stationed on Guam need a place to train” (Hofschneider,
2016a). However, the attorney Henkin stated,
     The Navy blatantly violated those mandatory legal duties when it decided to
     station Marines on Guam without any consideration of the destruction from
     live-fire training the Navy claims those Marines will need or of other places
     those Marines could be trained with far fewer impacts (Pang, 2016).
Delegate Gregorio “Kilili” S. Sablan, the CNMI nonvoting representative in the US
Congress, supports the “right of concerned citizens and community groups in the

Marianas to raise grievances” through the NEPA. He also recognizes that the islands
play an important role for “national defense” of the US and that is “why two-thirds
of Tinian, major portions of land in Saipan, and the entire island of Farallon de
Medinilla (FDM) have been leased to the federal government for military purposes”
(Dumat-ol Daleno, 2016).

Florine Hofschneider of the TWA said that, “when the Northern Marianas agreed
to remain part of the United States [entering into the Covenant to Establish a
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United
States of America in 1975], destroying the northern two-thirds of our island [Tinian]
with live-fire training and bombing was never part of the deal” (Jones, 2016). Her pro-
tection and defense resist the proposed high-impact training involving rockets and
grenades planned for 20 weeks per year and “non-live-fire” activities for 22 weeks a
year because of their impact on future generations.

The Indigenous Chamorro and Refaluwasch families who once called Pågan home
will be prevented from returning if Pågan becomes a target for bombing practice
4 months a year. Whelden claimed that high-explosive munitions would “only be
used on the volcanic hull area of Pågan,” while the wide beaches are perfect for am-
phibious exercises (Hofschneider, 2016a). The groups state in a complaint that such
military training poses “existential threat” for the Guardians of Gani' and others
who advocate a return to “a more traditional, productive and fulfilling lifestyle.” The
Guardians and their members view Gani', the islands north of Saipan, as the “last
frontier to revive their traditions and culture” (Sputnik News, 2016).

While the issues of high-impact and live-fire training are beyond the scope of the
Covenant, and the military already uses two-thirds of Tinian and all of No'os, the
women are adamant in resisting the additional acquisition of Pågan. Attorney
King-Hinds is determined to use her Indigenous knowledge(s) and honor of cul-
tural frameworks, as well as her legal power and Western education, to protect and
defend the Mariana Islands.

In May 2017, the Pacific Daily News reported that the lawsuit “threatens training
operations in the CNMI” (Limtiaco, 2017). Marine General Robert B. Neller said it
would be a “problem” if the lawsuit ultimately killed the firing range plan for Guam
Marines” (Olson, 2017). Now is the waiting period for the next EIS document to be re-
leased since the DOD has “agreed to perform an additional analysis of the potential
environmental impacts,” (Hofschneider, 2016a). A new document is expected “later
this year” [2017] according to Marine General Neller, and a Record of Decision is
expected in summer 2018 (Limtiaco, 2017; Hofschneider, 2016b). The current military
activity along the Korean Peninsula also complicates the build-up plans, perhaps
postponing them for years to come (Radio New Zealand, 2017).

Conclusion of Fanachu Famalåoʼan:
Women’s Resistance to Militarization in the Northern Mariana Islands
This chapter analyzed three women-led written and visual resistance efforts encom-
passing digital, legal, political, and spiritual elements. The Change.org petition, a
form of written and digital resistance addressed to Washington DC politicians, was
“signed” by over 120,000 people beyond the archipelago and picked up by the (inter)
national media (see Figure 3). The YouTube solidarity video, a form of visual resis-
tance portraying political, legal, and spiritual messages, was created by a Guam high
school girls’ class and was linked on digital sites through hashtags (see Figure 4).
The third example, the community lawsuit against the DOD, is the most recent form
of written legal and political resistance to militaristic expansion in the Marianas ar-
chipelago (see Figure 5). The combination of digital and legal organizing is growing
the nonviolent and organized resistance. The strategy is to continue to follow the
lawsuit, and prepare for the release of additional DOD plans and EIS documents.

Women are honoring their ancestral knowledge(s) to protect their communities and
defend their sacred and scarce land and seascapes from further US militarization.
Their resistance combines digital technologies and new media platforms to foster
fluidarity (solidarity) and unity between Guam, Tinian, Saipan, and the Gani' islands
(the Northern Mariana Islands). Through digital, political, and legal resistance, they
are visualizing and imagining alternative futures for the Mariana Islands as places
to re-establish spiritual practices with eco-tourism possibilities. This is part of the
long-term and continuous involvement of many dedicated mothers, sisters, aunties,
grandmothers, educators, politicians, and friends in the Marianas. Because mili-
tarization is a step-by-step process, so is demilitarization. These women understand
that refusing any form of the military is not possible (just yet), but they apply legal

pressure to enforce previous promises and agreements. The pending lawsuit is the
most effective form of contemporary resistance.

Chamorro and Refaluwasch women’s approaches of honoring their matrilineal her-
itage, respecting family genealogy, and cultivating the connection to the land and
seas provide strength. It is through Chamorro and Refaluwasch epistemologies that
they resist the devastation of US militarized security protection.

May I Borrow Some Soy Sauce? The Changing Dynamics of Neighborly Interactions in Rota (Ajani Burrell)

The story of Rota is, in many ways, the story of the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands (CNMI), and in a broader sense, the story of colonial territories in
modernity. After the first European visitor to the Marianas in 1521 (Russell, 2002, p.
23)—a brief stopover by Ferdinand Magellan as he attempted to circumnavigate the
globe—the people of the region experienced over 400 years of colonial occupation.
For the last half century, life has also been dominated by an external power, the
United States. Today, the CNMI is a US territory, affected as much by globalization
and the technical revolution as any other place on Earth. And yet, the story of Rota—
and that of the CNMI—has its own inimitable threads.

The main road from the airport to the historical population center of the island,
Songsong village, runs along the northern coastline. On one side, jagged rocks jut
from turquoise water. Fronted by foliage—coconut, palm, papaya, noni—and fore-
grounded by the expansive blue of the Pacific, the shoreline is pockmarked by rocky
beaches. On some of the beaches stand thatched or concrete canopies covering picnic

tables and barbeque grills. Both the beaches and the gathering areas are almost
always empty. On the other side, the land rises in a series of raised limestone plateaus
overrun by more emerald foliage. Perhaps most notable along this drive, apart from
the tranquil beauty, are the hand-painted signs welcoming everyone—residents and
visitors alike. One such sign admonishes passersby of the “Aluf Luta” (the Rota Wave),
which helps explain why the drivers of the two or three cars that pass wave as they
go by, and why, as one quickly observes, nearly everyone in Rota, whether driver or
pedestrian, does the same. Recently designated its own two-week celebration period
in August, the Rota Wave is a celebrated part of the island’s culture and emblematic
of the people’s hospitable disposition.

This hospitable disposition was on full display as I went around speaking with
people during my two visits to the island. I asked them what they thought about
life today, or whether they had noticed any changes in the past few years. Common
themes abounded. Most people lamented the loss of some of the more traditional
elements of the island’s culture. In this case, the traditional culture is best understood
as the customs and practices of the local population, which is still overwhelmingly
Chamorro and infused with some of the traditions wrought by several centuries
of colonial influence, most notably Spanish. The traditional culture, many fear, is
dying out. The Chamorro language is spoken less and less with each subsequent
generation—its place usurped by English. Notions of respect (respetu) are being
supplanted by Western ideals. Manngingi', the practice of taking an elder’s hand and
sniffing it in a show of respect, is decreasing in prevalence. Instead of manngingi', if
there is any display at all, a simple kiss on the cheek (casually referred to as åmen)
often suffices. The cultivation and consumption of traditional foods has also been
waning, as have other practices such as traditional healing, and skills including
basket weaving, fishing, and canoe building.

These circumstances, however, are not unique to Rota. Similar developments have
taken place across the Marianas (and other parts of Micronesia) to varying degrees.
They are also, in some way, the more notable aspects of cultural loss. It is easy to
understand and appreciate that a language is dying, or that certain skills are no
longer being widely transmitted from generation to generation. I had come to Rota
in hopes of identifying some aspect of the contemporary culture that is quintessen-
tially and ineffably Rota. On my second trip, I stumbled across a potential subject.
For many people in the CNMI, Rota occupies a special place in the culture of the
region. As more than one person has said to me, Rota is home to the purest form of
Chamorro culture left in the Marianas. The reasons for this can, in part, be traced
back over hundreds of years. The divergence between Chamorros of Rota and those
of the other inhabited southern islands in the Mariana chain—Saipan, Tinian, and
Guam—originates in their different fates under the so-called Spanish period (1521–
1899), which Russell (1994; 2002, p. 23) breaks up into an “alternate historic chronology
for Rota” that includes three shorter periods: Protohistoric (1521–1668); Reducción
(1668–1700); and Isolated Spanish Outpost (1700–1899). The Roman Catholic Church
created a lasting foothold in Rota and the rest of the Marianas during the Reducción
period, bringing with it the decline or disappearance of many traditional Chamorro
practices (Russell, 1998, p. 318). The reducción included the forced relocation of the
Indigenous people from the northern islands to Guam. In this, only Rota was spared,
and by 1722, when the last of the Chamorro families from Saipan were relocated to
Guam, Rota was the only other inhabited island of the Marianas (Farrell, 2011, p. 75).
The reducción also included the forced relocation of Chamorros “from traditional
settlements to mission villages,” which also served to undermine Indigenous cul-
ture by upending “traditional land-use practices” and ensuring “that non-Christian
practices were efficiently stamped out” (Russell, 1998, p. 317).

Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the impacts of the reducción and subsequent
historical eras were not quite as disruptive in Rota as in Guam. Though Rota contin-
ued to have a regular missionary presence, reports from those missionaries suggest
infrequent visits from outsiders, whether Spanish delegations from Guam or vessels
from other nations (Russell, 2002, p. 38). Carlos Madrid (2014), in his case study of
Rota’s Casa Real, presents evidence that the inhabitants of Rota publicly voiced
their displeasure over abusive practices by the Spanish Governor of the region, and
suggests that “Christian names were not used on a daily basis, at least not by the
people of Rota” (pp. 49-50). Other, later evidence also suggests a minimal Spanish
presence in Rota during the Isolated Spanish Outpost period. Census figures
from 1758 indicate 244 “Native Indians” living in Rota, but register no “Soldiers” or
“Spanish & Filipinos.” By comparison, the figures for Guam are 1467, 170, and 830,
respectively (Lévesque, 1999, p. 265). Madrid (2014) also reports that over a century
later, the people of Rota continued to resist attempts by government officials to re-
locate the Indigenous population to Guam (p. 50). Rota’s isolation was such that for

much of this time the island was a refuge for Chamorros fleeing Spanish oppression
elsewhere in the chain (Russell, 2002, p. 33). This isolation seems to have continued
through the German administration as well (Russell, 2002, p. 39), with the “German
administrative presences as exercised by German nationals” limited to Saipan,
except for a brief period from 1904-1906, and on average roughly just one official
visit to Rota per year on behalf of the administration (Spennemann, 2008, pp. 6–8).

For a number of reasons, the relative isolation of Rota has continued to the present.
This is not to say that the island was without dramatic cultural shifts and influenc-
es. Rather, given its relative inaccessibility and smaller population, it seems Rota
experienced comparatively less impact on its culture than the other islands. One
metric that helps underscore this comes from recent demographic data. The 2010
US Census indicates that Rota is the only island in the chain that, as of that year,
had a population that was majority Chamorro (CNMI Department of Commerce/
Central Statistic Division, 2012, p. 8). In 2010, approximately 37% of the population
of Guam were of Chamorro origin (Guam State Data Center Bureau of Statistics
and Plans, 2012, p. 24). In Tinian, that figure is about 38%. In Saipan, only 22% of the
population were of Chamorro origin (and 26% overall were of Northern Marianas
descent—either Carolinian or Chamorro), but in Rota, nearly 52% of the population
were of Chamorro origin, more than double that in Saipan (CNMI Department of
Commerce/Central Statistic Division, 2012, p. 8). Another metric that helps charac-
terize this unique place in the region comes from the 2016 CNMI Household Income
and Expenditure Survey Report (HIESR), which indicates that in both 2005 and 2016
Rota had the second highest percentage of households speaking Chamorro at home
(43.8% and 37.8%, respectively) of all the districts in the CNMI. Rota’s rates are about
double those for the CNMI as a whole (21.5% and 18.6%, respectively). Rota is also the
only island of the three inhabited islands in the CNMI where a plurality of the house-
holds spoke Chamorro in both 2005 and 2016 (CNMI Department of Commerce/
Central Statistic Division, 2017, pp. 21–22). These figures suggest that Rota has been
able to retain a more Chamorro identity than its neighbors have been able to.

Despite seeming to retain a stronger Chamorro identity than the other Mariana
islands, Rota has still undergone cultural changes, both big and small. During one
of my visits, I spoke with Magdalena Mesgon, the Director of the Department of
Community and Cultural Affairs (DCCA). She revealed a more nuanced dynamic
than many others I had heard, but one perhaps no less telling about the culture
today. We were in her air-conditioned office, in what used to be the island’s high
school, a far cry from the hot, humid weather outside. We had been chatting for a
while, when I asked her, again, whether there was anything different about Rota be-
tween today and the recent past. She paused for a few moments. “People today,” she
eventually said, “don’t go and ask their neighbors for favors anymore” (M. Mesgon,
personal communication, December 12, 2017).

I asked her what she meant. She explained that in the past, if you ran out of salt or
soy sauce or eggs and needed it at that moment, you could just go over to the neigh-
bors or send one of the kids to borrow what you needed. But today, people did not do
that anymore. “Do you still do this?” I asked. “No,” she said, a sad smile on her face.

I was surprised. Shocked even. I almost did not believe it, given what I had learned of
the people and customs of Rota. Surely, an island with less than 3,000 inhabitants, a
place where everyone professed to know pretty much everyone else, where one way
or another you were related to half the island, including many of your neighbors, a
place as welcoming and friendly as Rota, where you wave to everyone you pass on
the street, such a place would not have lost the practice of asking a neighbor for a
small favor in a pinch? Surely that could not be the case, could it? It must just be her,
right? “I think most people don’t do this anymore,” she replied. I decided to find out.

To standardize the exchanges, I simply told people that I was researching pres-
ent-day culture in Rota and asked if I could pose a few questions. I would start with a
hypothetical, based on the dynamic Magdalena shared: you’re at home cooking and
you realize you’ve run out of something essential—soy sauce or salt or eggs; would
you go to your neighbors to borrow the item? Of the dozen people I spoke with, only
one answered unequivocally in the affirmative. For everyone else, the answer was
usually a “no” or a qualified “no.”

The negative responses I received fell along a spectrum. A few people indicated that
the decision to borrow a missing item “depended on the neighbor.” If a neighbor was
a close family member, they were more comfortable asking for a favor, but they would
not ask a more distant relative or neighbors without a relationship to the family. For
many others, the answer was an outright and often emphatic “no.” A few people I

encountered at the airport before leaving Rota said, pointedly, that they do not ask
their neighbors for favors. Two women I interviewed at the DCCA offices assumed
they had misunderstood what I was asking, leading to the following exchange:

Woman 1: “I thought you were going to say about asking for soy sauce or what
in the neighborhood.”
Me: “Yes, literally.”
Both women laugh.
Woman 1 (with look of mild horror on her face): “Oh-oh-oh, okay.”
Woman 2 (shaking her head): “No, we don’t do that now.”
Me: “So, that is a thing?”
Woman 1: “Back then, yes. Now, no.”

A local man in his early 20s, whom I had met at the Chenchon Park Bird Sanctuary,
was even more blunt. The sanctuary encompasses a rocky coastline and dense
foliage that stretches to the ocean. Birds soared and dipped on a brisk breeze, but
otherwise, the park was tranquil in the bright midday sun. Under a gazebo perched
atop the cliffline, I posed the hypothetical to him: would he borrow some small item
from a neighbor? “Fuck no,” he said, shaking his head. “No way.”

As people shared their thoughts with me on this issue, I would, as a follow-up, ask
why they (and people in general) would not ask a neighbor to borrow some small
kitchen item. Almost every person indicated that the reluctance came from a sense
of pride or shame. As I reflected on my exchange with the young man at the bird
sanctuary, and on my conversations with other people on the subject up to that point,
it was difficult for me to understand how this practice could be associated with pride
and shame. I also struggled to understand the strength behind the reactions shared
by people I spoke with. Often, I could see the discomfort in their faces or in their
body language. It was as though even being asked the question subjected them to
some sort of shame. The young man was visibly distraught by the suggestion that he
might need to ask his neighbor for a favor.

Perhaps the most confounding aspect of this phenomenon was how at odds it was
with historical and even current perspectives of the people living in Rota. As an ex-
tremely isolated outpost for much of its history, including the post-WWII period,
the Rotanese as a group were almost entirely self-reliant. Their survival depended
on communal sharing. As one Chamorro manåmku' (elderly person) told me, up
until a couple of decades ago, it did not matter if supply ships came or if there was
food in the stores or not. The people grew and caught the food they needed. Today,
if the ships did not come, people would starve, but historically, the self-reliance and
sharing culture of the island was sufficient for survival. Another Chamorro manåm-
ku' I spoke with, named Tony, said much of the same thing. Interestingly, one of the
first things Tony shared before I could even pose the standard hypothetical, was that
in the past “you can just go to your neighbor and ask for salt or sugar or whatever
you need … but now no more.” She explained it this way:
      Before we don’t really need money because we don’t have money them days, but
      we work and share things so if you need something then I can share it with you
      if I have it … but nowadays if you don’t have anything, you don’t have money,
      you’re going to die because nobody provide you … When I was growing up that
      how I know how people live. In the morning, they don’t have, you know, not too
      many people have matches to make fire, so we usually use wooden stove and
      we use fire, we have to make fire, so whoever first make fire, on the neighbor,
      then the next neighbor will come over and ask for fire, even the fire they ask,
      so they go there and get the coconut shells and make fire, and the next one
      that sees you smoking then they will come over and get fire, but those are the
      difference. Now no more.
Given this background, it seems strange then, that in a couple decades, a prac-
tice once considered normal, commonplace—necessary even—would become a
near-anathema riven with shame.

This circumstance becomes even more confounding in light of other, related prac-
tices still evident today. Several people, as we discussed this particular development,
also indicated that key components of the sharing culture still exist. The earnest
young man I spoke with at the sanctuary told me that if he goes fishing or hunting
and comes home with a good catch, he will keep some for himself and his immedi-
ate family then divvy up the rest to share. With whom? His neighbors. He said he
would take a few pounds to each of his neighbors. And his neighbors would, in turn,
do the same with their fish, meat, fruit, or vegetables. But would he, in light of this
fact, go to the neighbors for some salt or soy sauce, I asked. “Never,” he replied. He
was not the only person to mention this dynamic, as several people I spoke with said

they too regularly shared excess food from harvests or catches with their neighbors,
and their neighbors with them. Similarly, the people of Rota, perhaps because the
community is so small and most people are acquainted, have a strong sense of com-
munal trust. I had noticed as I was driving around that there is a nearly complete
absence of “Private Property” or “No Trespassing” signs posted on people’s land.
Coming from Saipan, a larger island where it sometimes seems every other property
posts such signs, this struck me as interesting. I asked people about it, and they said
no one uses those signs because everyone knows everyone, and more importantly,
they trust one another. The reluctance, then, to borrow from one’s neighbor from
time to time is difficult to reconcile in light of such dynamics.

Another interesting aspect of this phenomenon is the relative speed with which it
has become ubiquitous. While responses differed among people regarding when
this practice changed for them, almost everyone I spoke with indicated that the
change had come within the last generation. Most of the people I interviewed were
middle-aged, and most told me that they could definitely remember times as a child
or adolescent when their parents or grandparents sent them to the neighbors for
some missing cooking item. But this was not just limited to those who were mid-
dle-aged. The young man at the bird sanctuary could also remember times in his
youth when his parents or grandparents sent him on similar errands. For others, the
conversion was even more recent, and occasionally they could pinpoint the exact
time at which they realized the change was upon them. Magdalena, the Director
of DCCA, recounted a conversation with her son from a few years earlier. She had
asked him, one day before he left for the military if he could “go to the neighbor and
ask … for some foil because I’m wrapping something for my potluck.” He turned
around, shocked, and said “Mom, are you not ashamed?” Surprised, she said no,
she was not ashamed, and called the neighbor and asked about the foil. The neigh-
bor was perfectly happy to share and said to send over the boy to pick it up. Her
son refused and she had to pick it up herself. After that, she too stopped asking her
neighbors for these sorts of favors. In this regard, she is not alone. I began asking
people when they thought this behavior changed, and for many, while they still
might have gone to the neighbor 10 years ago, nearly everyone that I asked said they
would not have gone to the neighbor 5 years ago. This seems to suggest that in the
span of a decade or less, the practice of going to one’s neighbors to ask a favor has
significantly decreased in prevalence.
Much uniformity existed in people’s description of their own behavior in these
situations. Similarly, there was a pervasive belief that most other people felt and
acted the same way (interviewees noted that their neighbors did not come to them
anymore either to borrow these small items). And while there was also a relatively
uniform belief that the underlying cause of this change is a sense of pride or shame,
the possible explanations for why this change has manifested varied more widely.
What follows is a brief description and commentary on some of the possible causes
of this phenomenon as identified by Rota residents.

Economic Shifts
Several people believed that, in some way, economic factors contributed to the de-
velopment. I found it remarkable that during several interviews, when respondents
considered why people stopped asking favors of their neighbors or why there might
be a sense of pride or shame in doing so, a fear of being viewed as unable to provide
for themselves was articulated. In the words of one interviewee, “You have a job with
a high salary and you need to ask me for salt?” Another said the neighbors would
think, “She just got paid yesterday. She can’t even buy ketchup?” This feeling seems
to suggest that as more people acquire gainful and reasonably well-compensated
employment, they should be able to afford these necessities. That people might not
have these necessities would thereby imply they were somehow irresponsible with
their finances, rather than a simple coincidence that one unexpectedly ran out of a
basic item. Economic data from the CNMI might provide additional evidence sug-
gesting this phenomenon took root around a decade ago and has since strengthened.
The first decade of the 21st century in the CNMI was a period of growth, followed by
a rapid downturn in the economy that reached a nadir in the aftermath of the global
housing market collapse. Since that time, the local economy—in Rota and the wider
CNMI—has steadily grown. Between 2005 and 2016, Rota saw an overall increase in
employment of more than 10%, according to the 2016 HIES report, while the CNMI,
as a whole, saw a similar decrease (though this decrease is largely due to the closing
of the garment industry). A higher percentage of workers in Rota are employed by
the government than in the other islands, though this percentage decreased over
that same period. The data are somewhat mixed in that it seems more people are
employed today than they were a decade ago, but the median and mean incomes for
Rota have decreased significantly over that same period, much more significantly
than for the CNMI as a whole (CNMI Department of Commerce/Central Statistics

Division, 2017, pp. 24-29). This could suggest that while more people are working,
money for households has become more scarce, which might explain why people
have such a sense of shame if they need to ask a neighbor for a favor.

Americanization
The rising influence of American values was another oft-cited contributing factor
to this phenomenon. As people shared their perspectives, the American values in
question seemed to be those of capitalism, individualism, and self-reliance rather
than the more traditional communal values of the islands. When I asked Tony
why so many people no longer asked their neighbors for favors, she said, “Time[s]
change, everything change[d], money talks and bullshit walks.” Her sentiment,
and use of this quintessential American trope, was echoed by several other people,
and she was not the only person to utter, verbatim, this saying. Other people also
mentioned that they or their family members had, in the last few decades, spent a
significant amount of time in the United States working, studying, or living with rel-
atives, which invariably impacted their worldview and practices. This is increasingly
the case for the islands, as more and more Indigenous people move to the mainland
for better education and employment opportunities, bringing back with them some
of the values acquired during their time away. The degree of cultural decline in the
islands may well be seen as proportional to the degree of American influence in
those islands. Guam, by most accounts, has undergone the greatest deterioration of
Indigenous culture (it has been a US territorial possession for over a century and is
home to large US military installations), while Saipan in the CNMI has seen it less
so, and Rota the least.

Another way to consider the impact of Americanization (and to a degree the next
topic, modernization), is according to age. As I spoke with people about this phe-
nomenon, I noticed a strong correlation between age and intensity—a kind of age
gradient. Younger people expressed the most resistance to the idea of asking their
neighbors for favors, and thereby tended to exhibit the most shame at the prospect
of doing so. Magdelena, the Director of DCCA, had indicated that her son was the
reason this matter came to her attention, and her recounting of the experience would
indicate that his resistance and shame over asking a neighbor for a favor was intense.
So too, for the young man I spoke with in the bird sanctuary. At the other end of the
spectrum, manåmku' were more likely to view such behavior as acceptable, while
people of middle age tended to present a more mixed set of feelings. It would seem
that the more steeped in American and modern ways a person is, the more likely he
or she is to find the practice of asking neighbors for favors objectionable.

Modernization
Some impact on this phenomenon also comes from the inevitable effects of mo-
dernity, including the technological revolution and globalization. Though more
indefinite in its parameters or effects, the role of modernization cannot be under-
stated, in particular the rise of the internet and social media. Several interviewees
mentioned, with dismay, the potential criticism or slights on social media they
might receive were they to go to their neighbors for a favor. The inevitable gossip
that happens in communities, coupled with the wider reach of social media and the
increasing prominence of full-time employment in the islands, seems to have made
this a potent barrier to earlier modes of neighborly interaction.

Demographic Shifts
The composition of neighborhoods, of whom one might have as neighbors, has also
been changing over the past several decades in Rota. Several people mentioned the
likely impact of familial dispersion as a cause of this behavior change. As recently as
20 years ago, it was likely that many of one’s neighbors were not just family, but close
family—parents and offspring, siblings, first cousins. More recently, as people come
of age, they often move away from the principal residence to start their own fami-
lies. This movement, whether to another island or the US mainland, or to another
village or part of the village in Rota, means that more people are living in proximity to
people who are not family or close relations. Tony indicated that was very much the
case for her family: “In our culture, the Chamorro culture … the families are really
close … and people surrounding they’re just like family, but now: no more.” Later, she
went on to say, “I live by myself right now. And that’s one thing that’s hurting me. I’m
all by myself, nobody is coming to see me or keep me company. Before, they used to
give the mother, the grandmother, to borrow their kids to be with, but now no more.”

One factor in this dynamic is the CNMI Village Homesteading Program. The pro-
gram, a consequence of Public Law No. 1-42 and promulgated in 1979, provides
homestead lots to persons of Northern Marianas descent who meet certain crite-
ria. According to the office of the Rota District of the Department of Public Lands

(personal communication, February 14, 2018), several villages in Rota are almost
exclusively comprised of homestead lots, and over 1,000 homesteads have been
allotted to date. These figures, given Rota’s population, account for roughly half
of all homes. The lots are typically created in undeveloped areas, and are awarded
randomly via lotteries, further increasing the chance of someone having neighbors
who are not close familial relations. This lack of familiarity—despite knowing one’s
neighbors and their daily routines, as one person mentioned—could contribute to
the sense of pride or shame one might feel in asking for a favor.

We may never know why, ultimately, the practice of asking one’s neighbors for a
favor—once so common in the small, communal society on Rota—seems to be
dying out. While the reasons offered by residents themselves are logical and com-
pelling, the dynamics are complex. There are also some lingering conundrums,
such as why the aversion to this practice seems to have so quickly spread, or why this
particular practice seems to be so associated with America and American values.
With regard to this study, it also suffers from sample size limitations, in particular
a lack of socio-economic diversity. Most of the people I interviewed were gainfully
employed. Perspectives might differ among the unemployed or underemployed, or
in more rural parts of the island, where people are not so directly integrated into the
economy and workforce.

Despite this lingering uncertainty, a few truths remain. The first is that this phe-
nomenon seems to have taken hold within a significant portion of the population on
Rota, and that this change is a divergence from previous practice. While the degree
to which it has taken place may be up for debate, as well as its prevalence among the
younger people, one other truth remains and is perhaps even more consistent: sad-
ness. The people of Rota with whom I spoke about this phenomenon were almost
universally saddened by it. They felt that they were losing an essential element of
their culture. A couple even wondered aloud what it meant or what else they might
be losing but are unaware of. As the small prop plane for my thirty-minute flight
home taxied down the runway and lifted off, the seats behind me filled mostly with
jovial Rota residents making a trip to Saipan for a Christmas work party, I felt a
sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach stronger than the mere Newtonian pull
of the plane against gravity. It felt like loss. And sadness.

Militarism and Sovereignty in the Contemporary Northern Mariana Islands (Theresa “Isa” Arriola)

Every few weeks in the CNMI, the US military publishes an inconspicuous notice in
the local newspapers that include the dates and times they will be using the northern
island of Farallon de Medinilla or FDM (No'os in Chamorro)⁴⁶ for target practice.
FDM is located approximately 45 nautical miles (80 km) north of Saipan in the
Marianas archipelago and has been used as a live and inert range by the Department
of Defense since 1971 despite being home to a number of bird species including the
endangered Micronesian Megapode (Megapodius laperouse) (Lusk et al., 2000).
During the drafting of the CNMI Covenant, FDM was to be used for defense respon-
sibilities and cost the military a total of $20,600.⁴⁷ The DOD currently maintains
an active lease with the CNMI Government that began in 1983 and has an option to
renew for another 50 years (Hofschneider, 2016). Due to the military’s testing, fishing
vessels, tour operators, and the public are advised not to enter the general location
of the maneuvers which includes up to 12 nautical miles around the island. These
notices are published fairly often but quickly fade into the background to make way
for other more pressing news stories. I draw attention to this particular notice as a

way to highlight how militarization promotes a routinization of violence that is easily
glossed over as a necessary component of the political agreement between the CNMI
and the United States rather than an ongoing and contingent negotiation.

This chapter’s main intervention within this line of argument then is to disrupt the
common narrative that sovereignty was “given up” for United States citizenship at
the time of the CNMI Covenant’s creation and that military planning is a “necessary
evil”⁴⁸ that we bargained for when we signed the 1975 Covenant agreement. Rather
than accepting the Covenant as a stranglehold on future discussions of our political
status and increased militarization, I instead call the concept of sovereignty into
question beginning at the time of the creation of the Covenant agreement⁴⁹ in an
attempt to reconceptualize the sociopolitical potential of sovereignty for our people.
In doing so, I advocate for indigenizing sovereignty (Nadasdy, 2017)—a perspective
that is grounded in an Indigenous epistemology of land, and I argue that processes
of decolonization must examine the role of militarism in shaping the trajectory of
Indigenous sovereignties throughout the entire Marianas. This is a vision of sov-
ereignty as dynamic and emergent: sovereignty measured by how well Indigenous
peoples in the Marianas are empowered to maintain ownership and control over
their lands, rather than sovereignty defined by political status. I draw on historical
documentation regarding the CNMI Covenant throughout the CNMI community,
contemporary discussions regarding political status in news media, informal inter-
views, and participant observation in Saipan from 2016 to 2020. I draw heavily from
theories of sovereignty within Indigenous and Native Studies to critique the conven-
tional understanding of Euro-American sovereignty and explore its possibilities for
our political presents and futures in the Northern Mariana Islands.

Indigenous Sovereignty
Sovereignty is a fraught topic that is both political and personal, particularly as it
pertains to Indigenous peoples who continue to negotiate its meaning within the
context of settler societies where juridical notions of sovereignty often contradict
notions of Native sovereignty. In order to work through this contradiction, Teves et
al. (2015) ask “Is Native sovereignty the same sovereignty articulated within Western
political discourse?” and “If not, can Native peoples rearticulate sovereignty given
its ideological baggage?” (pg. 3). These questions raise important insights into the
meaning of sovereignty within the context of Indigenous political systems nested
within United States political frameworks (A. Simpson, 2014). In these contexts,
Euro-American conceptions of sovereignty continue to dominate the sociopolitical
narratives while simultaneously undercutting Indigenous political systems that do
not fit neatly within the bounds of its definition (Deloria, 1979).

In its most conventional and popularized form, sovereignty is defined primarily as
“Supremacy or pre-eminence in respect of excellence or efficacy”; a second defini-
tion is, “Supremacy in respect of power, domination, or rank; supreme dominion,
authority, or rule” (Oxford, n.d.). By definition the state is characterized as having
enough power to exist independently and “regulate one’s own internal functions
in the field of domestic relations” (Deloria, 1979, p. 22). The state is presumed to be
the apex of power and even “the precondition for politics” itself (Nadasdy, 2017, p. 3).
Sovereignty then as a concept is inseparably enmeshed with the production of the
“modern” nation state, in which the nation is viewed as a supreme authority that
rules over an easily demarcated or bounded territory. The roots of this concept can
be traced back to the Enlightenment and the Age of Discovery, and is “directly tied to
the need to codify and regulate the practices of conquest and the settlement of lands
with peoples deemed uncivilized—and hence unsovereign” (Bonilla, 2017, p. 332).

The history of colonization within Indigenous communities flips the definition of
sovereignty on its head by highlighting how the term is both historically contingent
and dynamic where Indigenous expressions of sovereignty are often in direct con-
frontation with the state and even precede European conceptions (Nadasdy, 2017).
As Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) scholar J. Ke’haulani Kauanui (2017) has point-
ed out, “Any discussion of sovereignty is sure to entail competing epistemological
frames, and thus different ontological orientations and diverse political forms in
theorizing our political present” (p. 326). Sovereignty is therefore negotiable, fluid
and ever-changing, yet deeply meaningful and real. At any particular moment in
history, the term means different things to different peoples, but has tremendous
capacity to inform Indigenous political life and futurity through its possibilities.
Defining sovereignty is therefore an exercise in power itself and is a form of ne-
gotiation rooted in one’s experience within a changing society and especially in
the context of decolonization. Indigenous perspectives have much to offer to the
concept of sovereignty because of the ways that they both transform and challenge
traditional statist ideologies that envision statehood as a political end goal.

Sovereign Limits
Indigenous theorists have long recognized the inherent limits of employing
European concepts of sovereignty to understand the politics of Indigenous nations,
territories, and commonwealths where sovereignties are deeply interdependent
(Cattelino, 2008), emergent (Uperesa & Garriga-López, 2017), nested (A. Simpson,
2014), entangled (Nadasdy, 2017), paradoxical (Kauanui, 2018), and interact with stat-
ist ideologies in complex ways. Many of these political arrangements exist outside
the normative notions of a sovereign nation-state and defy the “universal norm” of
sovereignty (Bonilla, 2013). This is because for many Indigenous peoples, sovereignty
is not simply a political concept but “is at its core about relationships—relationships
with each other and with plant and animal nations, with our lands and waters and
with the spiritual” (L. Simpson, 2015, as cited in Hiller & Carlson, 2018, p. 49). Such
perspectives reveal the political possibilities and limitations of sovereignty and
have been a critical component of theorizing Indigenous political resurgence, resis-
tance, and negotiation against colonial concepts of sovereignty that seek to codify
Indigenous political systems and forms of governance (Trask, 1999).

Because of these historical complexities and competing epistemological positions,
I do not attempt to define sovereignty within Chamorro and Refaluwasch commu-
nities, but to examine the stakes of contemporary renderings of sovereignty in the
Northern Mariana Islands, particularly amidst ongoing militarization—a process
that is often in direct conflict with movements towards the protection of Indigenous
land. This examination requires an unsettling of current assumptions that un-
dergird definitions of sovereignty and decolonization in the context of the CNMI
Covenant, as well as in the context of Indigenous theory-making more broadly. For
the territories and commonwealths that are popularly characterized as living under
United States sovereignty, such as Guam and the CNMI, these realities are often
complicated by the fact that the United States does not view itself as an empire and
“is often presented as an exception to the colonial model of state power” (Uperesa &
Garriga-López, 2017, p. 39). The mere existence of places like Guam and the CNMI
in the political imaginary as we know them today, like other “discontiguous States
of America” (Lai, 2011), do much to trouble this perception of exceptionalism and
debunk this myth about American history (Kiste, 1993, p. 66).

On February 15, 1975, when the CNMI Covenant was signed, a headline in the New
York Times read, “The United States signed a covenant today that will eventually
make the Northern Marianas [sic] Islands in the Pacific a commonwealth, under
American sovereignty, much like Puerto Rico” (“Pact”, 1975). As an unincorporated
territory, under American sovereignty, these designations secured a political dis-
tancing between the CNMI and the United States that continues to characterize our
contemporary social and political relationship. Sovereignty in the CNMI is therefore
complicated by the fact that federal legislation can supersede local self-governance,
despite the fact that self-governance implies a level of political autonomy (at least in
theory) to the people of the Northern Marianas. This legal paradox has led to much
debate within United States legal circles, leading one legal analyst to question, “…
in the event of an irreconcilable conflict arising between the Northern Marianas
people and the United States government regarding an internal matter of the CNMI,
who must prevail?” (Horey, 2003, p. 182). In reference to this ambiguity within the
CNMI Covenant, Horey (2003) writes that there was no “suggestion or agreement as
to precisely how, as a practical matter, local self-government would be secured from
federal interference. The only agreement was that, somehow, it would” (p. 241). This
legal quandary is relevant to the contemporary context of troop “repositioning” in
the Pacific as part of the ongoing military build-up as the superseding of federal leg-
islation over local laws has historically occurred because of increased militarization
in the name of national defense. This quandary also calls into question the very
notion of ownership over marine resources, submerged lands, and other “federal-
ized” spaces such as marine monuments within the United States Insular Areas in
the context of militarization. As Bonilla (2017) explains, to define the boundaries of
its territory, nation-states rely on certain “territorializing assumptions” and “consti-
tutive exclusions” that define who can and cannot become part of the nation.

(Un)incorporated into the Nation
The United States designation of islands as insular territories to be administered by
the War Department’s Bureau of Insular Affairs in the late 19th and early 20th cen-
turies is one such form of demarcation. By including the category of unincorporated
territory into the political vocabulary, territories remained in spaces of “liminality”
and “deferral” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 15). This has manifested in what Fallon (1991)
argues is an “ambivalent, if not antagonistic, attitude toward granting independence
to these territories” (p. 31).⁵⁰ Such designations, which produced a sense of being

half in and half out of political decision-making, is evident in the juridical recogni-
tion of territories as “foreign … in a domestic sense” when discussions surrounding
the much-debated Insular Cases were under way (Burnett & Marshall, 2001; Kaplan,
2005) In reference to Puerto Ricans, Amy Kaplan (2005) describes this legal para-
dox as a “limbo in space and time” that allows the United States to interpret the
political futures of the territories and commonwealths in ways that both deny them
the ability to become a state but also the ability to become an autonomous nation
(p. 3). Kaplan’s (2005) analysis in The Anarchy of Empire in the Making of US Culture
highlights how such paradoxes are not anomalies at all, but rather part and parcel
of United States’ empire building and that far from being contradictory, the foreign
and the domestic are co-constitutive (p. 4). By touching on the Insular Cases in this
discussion, my point is not simply to re-hash the imperial and racist roots from
which these legal opinions and juridical categories have sprung. Instead, I wish to
highlight how these discourses pervade current discussions of self-determination
among the Chamorro and Refaluwasch people in the CNMI by framing sovereignty
as subsumed by and through United States political frameworks.⁵¹ The legacy of
the Insular Cases continues to provide the foundation for the flourishing of other
imperial formations (Stoler et al., 2007) that do not easily fit within the context of
colonialism as it is typically imagined. One such manifestation in our contempo-
rary world is the assimilationist discourse of inclusivity into an “American political
family.” Such discourses have long been detrimental to Native peoples whose strug-
gles are framed within the context of exclusion/inclusion into the broader nation
state (Byrd, 2011, p. xxv) and work to foreclose Indigenous political imaginaries.

Assimilation into a broader American political family was an influential narra-
tive employed in early Covenant negotiations between the United States and the
CNMI in the early 1970s. The Marianas Political Status Commission of 1974 de-
scribed this commonwealth union as “the name given to a self-governing political
entity which is closely attached to another, larger political unit such as a nation.”
Between 1972–1974, there were five rounds of CNMI Covenant negotiations before
the Commonwealth Bill was signed into law (US Public Law 94-241) by US President
Gerald Ford on March 24, 1976 (McPhetres, 1997, as cited in Babauta & Babauta,
2008, p. 5). During this time, assimilationist discourses that aimed to incorporate
the CNMI into a United States political structure provided powerful narratives that
influenced Covenant negotiators in Saipan, which was considered the capitol island
of Micronesia at the time. For example, the Honorable Edward De Leon Guerrero
Pangelinan, Chairman of the Marianas Political Status Commission (MPSC) at the
time, understood Indigenous relations with the United States as something that
both expanded economic opportunities and provided a sense of incorporation into
a broader American social, political, and economic family. He explained,
     As citizens, we enjoy the benefits of being part of the richest and strongest
     nation in the world. The geographic boundary of the CNMI is no longer limited
     to the boundaries of the island’s lagoon, it extends from the CNMI to American
     Samoa to Hawaii, the continental United States and to the American Caribbean
     of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Our lands are the most beautiful and
     scenic spots on this planet. And what about the communities we have built—our
     cities, towns, counties, villages and the length and breadth of our country. And
     finally, the diversity of our people, the Indigenous Chamorro/Carolinians, all
     are now members of a much larger community of over 300 million Americans.
     We all benefit from the various cultural and ethnic diversity of our American
     population. (Babauta & Babauta, 2008, pg. 5)
Mr. Pangelinan’s statement links a diverse array of other United States territorial
“possessions” with the continental United States through their incorporation
into an American political system that he frames as “ours.” In the CNMI, where
Chamorros and Refaluwasch are often simultaneously understood and self-identify
as both Indigenous and American, assimilationist discourses are often recapitulated
through civil rights frameworks transplanted from the United States of America that
effectively erase indigeneity through the racialization of Chamorro/Refaluwasch
people as an ethnic group within America. Such discourses continue to be produced
through the expansion of federal policies via militarization today and have profound
consequences on contemporary Indigenous politics where the power to retain
control over Indigenous lands as the ancestral people of the Northern Marianas is
complicated by the legal designation as American citizen.

Linking Sovereignty to Decolonization
Sovereignty is fundamentally linked to decolonization since it involves a critical
re-thinking of how we envision who we are as a people and how we envision the
future of our political systems, particularly in relation to the broader American
nation. It entails an unsettling (Bonilla, 2017) of who we are as Indigenous peoples in
today’s world where decolonization is commonly associated with state-sanctioned

processes that often link political independence with a complete disconnection from
larger nation states. Sovereignty is thus linked to our relative political agency or abil-
ity to continue to negotiate our political futures, much like our community did in the
early days of the Covenant negotiations when questions surrounding the exercise of
our political power were surfacing. Yarimar Bonilla’s (2017) preference for the term
unsettling as opposed to decolonizing is instructive here since it “avoids the telos of
decolonization. What is unsettled is not necessarily removed, toppled or returned
to a previous order but is fundamentally brought into question” (p. 335). The term
“unsettling” is a useful analytic to employ in the Pacific where many islands remain
technically de-colonized, but remain under US hegemony (Pöllath, 2018) and where
some—such as Guam—remain on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing
Territories (NSGT). In this light, it is helpful to understand decolonization less as
a linear political process with a defined end goal than it is to view it as a dynamic
and transformative process situated at the complex intersection of sociopolitical and
historical circumstances.

In the context of United States-CNMI relations, sovereignty remains an inroad
for exploring contemporary changing social dynamics in the Marianas and to
unpack the ways that United States sovereign power is asserted over local political
decision-making via the powerful sociopolitical influence of militarization. An ad-
equate examination of our political futures must engage with the influential power
of militarization on our islands, where United States hegemony manifests itself in
ways that are not always so obviously tied to traditional concepts of colonialism. As
Na'puti (2013) points out,
     Today colonial control and imperial rule no longer manifest in overt and hostile
     taking of land as was common in the era of European colonialism. Instead, colo-
     nialism operates in more covert ways, through the control of labor markets and
     neoliberal reforms and by exerting military and political pressures through-
     out the globe. (p. 56)
Amidst increasing militarization, processes of decolonization can be understood less
as breaks from the trajectory of larger nation state building, and more a site of polit-
ical contestation and ongoing negotiation with the United States. Yet the prospects
of re-negotiating the CNMI’s political status with the United States often led people
in Saipan to ask me, “if not the United States military, then who?” In other words,
how could we possibly survive, “who would we even be, without the United States?”

This phrase was usually followed up by an assertion that if it were not for the United
States presence here on our islands, we would be overtaken or threatened by another
nation like China or North Korea—a narrative largely promulgated by the conver-
sations surrounding the United States’ Pacific Pivot that capitalizes on the threats
posed to the Marianas from the Asian continent. While I do not seek to downplay the
real dangers that have been asserted against the islands by countries such as China
and North Korea, I do want to contextualize our islands’ involvement in the broad-
er geopolitical and military strategy between nation states whose priorities center
around the promotion of defense goals rather than Indigenous sovereignty.

Creating a (Trust) Territory, Defining the Common(wealth)
What does decolonization mean when Indigenous homelands have been reconfig-
ured as American territory and where decolonization is foreclosed by commonwealth
status? Furthermore, how do we define “the commons” in a territorial possession?
In his essay entitled “Against death maps of Empire: Contesting colonial borders
through Indigenous sovereignty,” Eric Ritskes (2015), writing about Jodi Byrd’s con-
cept of the commons, asserts,
     Byrd (2011) recognizes indigeneity as a necessary obstacle to ‘the commons’
     as a means of decolonization because the commons is conceptualized on and
     through lands stolen from Indigenous peoples; the idea of the commons was
     not only always exclusionary, as Kim Christen (2012) argues, but always already
     embedded in colonial dispossession.
In the case of the CNMI, Indigenous experiences living in an unincorporated
territory push the limits of the terms like “decolonization” in productive ways by
challenging what it means to be part of a broader commons defined by a larger
nation state. What decolonization actually means in a United States territory⁵²—
where the full spectrum of constitutional rights is not present—has long been up
for debate. Fallon (1991) expands on the paradoxical nature of this political agree-
ment when he writes,
     The necessary basis of equality is missing because the islands do not have equal
     representation in the US Congress, the inhabitants of the Northern Marianas
     cannot vote for president, the islands may be subject to federal laws not applicable
     to the states, and the legislature of the “Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas”
     does not conform in its structure and nature to the state legislatures. (p. 29)

The various United States territorial statuses of the islands that comprise the Pacific
therefore exist within a “murky” political zone “lying between formal statehood
and official independence” (Fallon, 1991, p. 23). As a commonwealth—a term which
in itself is rather nebulous⁵³ —the people of the CNMI opted for a closer political
union with the United States that recognized local self-government, but in many
ways privileged United States citizenship.

Discussions surrounding decolonization in the Marianas are complicated by the
meaning of colonization itself, especially in the CNMI, where United States political
hegemony is often framed as a necessary component of securitization in the region
rather than a form of occupation. Banivanua-Mar (2016) argues that this perspective
was exemplified by the US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson’s characterization
of the Pacific Islands as critical defense “outposts” to detract from the problematic
use of the label “colonies.” (p. 117) Thus, Northern Marianas history is convention-
ally understood as moving in teleological fashion from conquest to colonization to
self-government. Importantly, colonization in the case of the Northern Marianas
usually refers to Spanish, German and Japanese occupation, rather than the United
States, which is commonly viewed as a nation state that negotiated with the CNMI
rather than as a colonizer. It has been argued, for example, that the Northern
Mariana Islands were “no longer true colonies” (Horey, 2003, p. 21) under the juris-
diction of the League of Nations, since the Indigenous peoples were seen as desiring
to integrate “American ideals of democracy, equality and popular sovereignty … and
that there be a break from the colonial past, not a continuation of it under anoth-
er name” (Horey, 2003, p. 242). From this perspective, the creation of the Covenant
symbolized for many in the Northern Marianas a move towards incorporation into a
broader nation that signified the end of colonization, rather than another beginning.

Having been framed in the language of self-determination, the ideological and polit-
ical transformation of the Mariana Islands, from its status within the Trust Territory
of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) to a United States commonwealth, also symbolized for
many an exercise in sovereign power that had not been afforded under any other
previous colonial regime. As Chamorro legal scholar Nicole Torres (2012) points
out, “the CNMI acted as a sovereign in negotiating the Covenant with the United
States, which specifically acknowledges the CNMI’s inherent sovereignty.” (p. 173)
This process is viewed as a distinguishing political feature between the CNMI and
the largest and southernmost island of Guam, which is undergoing a political status
education campaign regarding a formal path to decolonization through the United
Nations due to its non-self-governing territorial status.⁵⁴ While the 1950 Organic Act
granted US citizenship to those living in Guam, it allowed for only a limited form
of “self-government” and one non-voting delegate in Congress. Thus, the CNMI’s
political status can be viewed as “temporalized in a moment” (A. Simpson, 2010) and
the Covenant codified sovereignty by framing it as something that was given up in
favor of citizenship.

The Sovereignty/Citizenship Trade-off and the Dependency Dilemma
In an attempt to learn more about the perception of sovereignty as something that
was traded for citizenship during Covenant negotiations, I conducted an interview
with Chamorro lawyer and sovereignty scholar Mr. Robert Torres from Saipan. I
began by asking Mr. Torres about his views regarding the history of sovereignty and
its implications for contemporary society in the CNMI. He responded,
     you ask yourself … when has a people ever had an opportunity for true inde-
     pendence and forsake independence and bargain away their own sovereignty in
     favor of a favorable political relationship with its former trustee … never … this
     commonwealth was a kind of anomaly in this history, and so Guam never had
     an opportunity to negotiate for this.
In his explanation, Mr. Torres frames this unique history as one in which we entered
into a bargaining relationship with the United States as a former trustee by giving up
our sovereignty. CNMI historian Samuel McPhetres (1997) also notes this agreement
in his popularly referenced history book entitled Self-Government and Citizenship in
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. He explains that this decision
     was an act of self-determination by a sovereign Indigenous population who
     voluntarily opted for union with the United States knowing that they had inde-
     pendence as an alternative. It was the first time that this had ever happened in
     the history of the United States.
Despite the fact that the Marianas was not considered self-governing at the time,
the decision to enter into a political union with the United States was viewed as
an act of “inherent sovereignty” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 48). Guam on the other hand
was viewed as never having had the opportunity to participate in such a historical
moment. Given this fact, I continued to inquire as to why independence was such a
controversial idea at the time.

      T.A.: It’s interesting that independence was immediately associated with having
      no connection with the United States, like you are turning your back on the
      country. I’m curious as to why independence was so controversial.
      R.T.: The majority of people did not see independence as the path of opportu-
      nity, progress or development … The fact of the matter is, when we bargained
      for the Covenant, we signed onto a deal that wholesale adopted the American
      system of governance, laws and jurisprudence and economic benefits and every-
      thing. We did. And now it can’t be terminated unless there is a mutual consent
      provision which it’s obviously not going to happen that the United States would
      have a mutual agreement to terminate the Covenant … so we have to now work
      within a system of laws and rules and finances that is affected by US policies, on
      immigration, on labor, on an environment, and as the ebb and flow goes in the
      United States so too goes the CNMI … So we bargained for this, and we signed
      on for it and that’s the deal we made.

In his discussion, Mr. Torres highlights the deep legal entanglements that have
emerged from the Covenant negotiations. While the mutual consent provision
offers us a level of protection against unlawful Congressional power, Indigenous
political lives are now so inextricably linked to United States political systems
that the implementation of the provision is now often viewed as an impossibility.
Covenant expert and co-author of An Honorable Accord: The Covenant Between the
Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, Howard P. Willens (2003) explains
that the CNMI’s political arrangement is both “constitutional and successful” and
that the mutual consent provision “protects the Northern Marianas people from
having the fundamental terms of their relationship with the United States being
unilaterally altered by the US Congress—as Congress is presently free to do with
respect to Guam and the other US territories” (p. 376). I highlight Willens’ analysis
here to point out that while contemporary debates surrounding the CNMI’s polit-
ical status center around issues of US constitutionality, this analysis misses out on
the broader issue of dependency that militarism produces. Put another way, legal
provisions—even the ones meant to protect the CNMI—cannot be divorced from
the broader history of imperialism throughout the Marianas, where US military
goals remain preeminent. Without contextualizing the history of the Covenant in
this way, arguments over whether or not the CNMI’s status remains constitution-
al will do little to expand the horizons of decolonization in the Pacific. Chamorro
scholar Michael Bevacqua (2017) has characterized the similar situation in Guam
as a “decolonial deadlock,” which people liken to suicide, and can be described as
“a discursive formation that circles around the idea that the best possible political
and social configuration in Guam has already been reached through its colonial re-
lationship to the United States and that hence, nothing more need be done” (p. 107).
In the CNMI, discussions surrounding the Covenant often foreclose possibilities for
future dialogue about Indigenous futures by placing a stranglehold on discussions
of decolonization. The formation of commonwealth in the CNMI and territorial
status in Guam are viewed as meaningful political arrangements that make it diffi-
cult to speak about our contemporary relations with the United States as imperial
in nature. This stifling of the political imagination also frames decolonization as a
simplified “choice between national independence in isolation and emancipation
in association or integration with the colonizing power” (Heim, 2017, p. 915). In the
CNMI, our militarized legal entanglements with the United States remind us that
decolonization has never been a simple question of what is legal or not.

The Limits of a Commonwealth Status
In 2008, the US Congress federalized the CNMI immigration system despite the
CNMI government’s popular disapproval of this legislation. One year earlier, at a
hearing before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, David B. Cohen
(Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs) testified that while the CNMI had
made improvements to working conditions since the 1990s, serious concerns over
homeland security, human trafficking and mistreatment of refugees throughout the
islands still remained. For these reasons, Cohen concluded that with the help of
the US Congress, the CNMI’s immigration system must be federalized as soon as
possible through the passing of bill S.1634, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant
Implementation Act. This was an important moment for the people of the CNMI,
who lacked representation in Congress yet were being subjected to federal oversight
over immigration policies that were seen as failing. While Cohen was clear about
the need to federalize, his statement also highlighted the inequitable political rela-
tionship between the US and CNMI. He explained,
     we’re concerned about the message that would be sent if Congress were to
     pass this legislation while the CNMI remains the only US territory or com-
     monwealth without a delegate in Congress. At a time when young men and
     women from the CNMI are sacrificing their lives in Iraq in proportions that

    far exceed the national average, we hope that Congress will consider granting
    them a seat at the table at which their fate will be decided. (United States/
    CNMI Political Union, 2007)
At the conclusion of the federalization process, CNMI residents remained uneasy
about what this controversial change meant in terms of federal encroachment over
local laws even amidst the criticism of the local government’s failings.

In a Marianas Variety article entitled “CNMI Lawmaker Advises Review of US Ties,”
CNMI Representative Stanley T. Torres framed the issue in terms of an unequal re-
lationship between the US and the CNMI. He crafted House Bill 17-7, calling for the
creation of a Second Marianas Political Status Commission that would re-evaluate
this political relationship. In a telling interview, Torres stated,
     [the] timing is very right to bring this proposal up because it appears that the
     federal government has been screwing us for a long time … The feds give us
     money but instead of letting us make the best use of it ourselves, they put a lot
     of restrictions. (Erediano, 2011)
Torres’ comments reflect the CNMI’s inability to adequately exercise the right to
self-government, and similar sentiments continued to remain a theme into the mid-
2000s as US military planning burgeoned alongside these concerns. In 2015, House
Bill 19-2 was submitted⁵⁵ to the Nineteenth Northern Mariana Commonwealth
Legislature. In short, the bill was titled the Second Marianas Political Status
Commission Act of 2015⁵⁶, whose purpose was to reinvigorate the call to create a
Second Marianas Political Status Commission
     that the people desire to reexamine whether continuing, in a “Political Union
     with the United States of America” under the Covenant is in their best interest,
     or whether some other political status will better enable them to fulfill their
     hope and aspirations in attaining full and meaningful self-government, as stated
     by the late US Senator Jacob Javits of the State of New York in the deliberations
     of the Covenant and as amended.
Recognizing that the current political time in which we find ourselves no longer
accommodates the CNMI’s desires for self-determination, the goal of the Second
Marianas Political Status Commission was to meaningfully engage in discussions
regarding contemporary political relations with the United States. Authored by Rep.
Felicidad Ogumoro (R-Saipan), the CNMI Senate passed the House bill by a vote of
6-1 on December 19, 2014. The Commission consists of nine voting members and two
non-voting ex-officio members, including two persons from Rota, two from Tinian,
and five from Saipan. The bill came on the heels of a number of important chang-
es in the CNMI, among which “Submerged land control, rampant militarization,
and the federal immigration takeover” ranked as the most pressing (Chan, 2016).⁵⁷
Arguably, while all three political concerns are presented as separate issues, they
can be viewed as falling under the same umbrella of militarism.⁵⁸ In an interview
about her experiences regarding the authoring of House Bill 19-2, Rep. Ogumoro
(personal communication, July 6, 2020) explained,
     The US continues to make policies without proper consultation and if there is
     consultation and we say no, just like in the case of the military … when we are
     trying to make a point … they keep going, as if we are talking to the birds.
Having personally heard her express similar concerns about the Covenant in past
gatherings, I inquired about her experience with the Covenant negotiations as well.
According to Rep. Ogumoro (personal communication, July 6, 2020), she explained,
     look back into the reports even in our books, it only took … oh my gosh … less
     than a year … such a short time for public education for the people to under-
     stand what the Covenant really means. You see what is happening now for the
     other [Pacific] entities such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau and
     the Federated States of Micronesia … they are on equal footing with US … with
     us, the US is speaking on our behalf and that is so obvious when we go to the
     United Nations … we sit behind the US and they speak on our behalf.
Rep. Ogumoro’s sentiments echo the much longer resistance that existed in Saipan
to accepting commonwealth status as the best option for the people of the CNMI.
In particular, it has been noted that the Saipan Women’s Association (SWA) and the
United Carolinian Association (UCA) were vocal opponents of the Covenant while
major support came from the Marianas Political Status Commission (McPhetres,
1997, p. 54). This history is helpful for understanding how resistance to political ne-
gotiations with the US has historically manifested itself among different groups in
ways that do not always fit neatly into a pro-US narrative.

In a Saipan Tribune article entitled “Meaning of Covenant Questioned,” John
Tagabuel, executive director of the Carolinian Affairs Office, stated that the “US is
treating us like a US territory” (Chan, 2016) like Guam or Samoa, which are non-gov-
erning entities. In comparing our status to Guam, Mr. Tagabuel’s comments reveal a
number of complex social and political realities that continue to shape discussions

of Indigenous self-governance in the Marianas. First, as previously mentioned, as a
commonwealth, the CNMI is viewed as having more political autonomy than the
neighboring island of Guam, which remains on the UN list of Non-Self-Governing
Territories (NSGT). Similarly, Tagabuel’s comments reveal the relative political disad-
vantage that American Samoans, as American nationals (as opposed to US citizens),
have in comparison to those living in the Northern Marianas. This perspective has
also frequently been brought up by Saipan residents in personal conversations when
referring to Guam’s political status by stating, “At least we are a commonwealth.”
In fact, when applied to the CNMI, the label of territory is considered offensive to
some since it elides important differences between the CNMI and Guam regarding
self-governance. At a public presentation about the legal status of the US territories
in which I was in attendance on Saipan in 2018,⁵⁹ John Gonzales (president of the
Northern Marianas Descent Corporation) stated that to call the CNMI a “territory is
an insult … who went through a process unlike any other” islands in the region. In
this regard, commonwealth status is often a mark of distinction that is upheld as a
source of pride for the people of the CNMI.

In legal terms, the designation of commonwealth status along with the creation of
the CNMI Covenant, the Constitution, and the ensuing political union with the
United States bestow upon the CNMI a level of political autonomy that simply is
not present in many other “territories.” In fact, in a 1975 plebiscite vote to become a
US commonwealth, the Indigenous populations of the Northern Mariana Islands
were understood as the only people ever known to have “voluntarily opted for
union with the United States knowing that they had independence as an alterna-
tive” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 57). This autonomous decision was understood as an “act
of self-determination by a sovereign Indigenous population” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 57)
and is tied to the fact that the political union between the CNMI and the United
States could not be altered unless by agreement on behalf of both parties. This was
defined as a mutual consent agreement (or mutual consent clause) written into the
Covenant as a way to thwart an abuse of power should it ever arise. As a result, Guam
is sometimes upheld as an exemplar of what the CNMI does not want in regard to
self-determination, as its official status remains an unincorporated, organized ter-
ritory in which the Organic Act of 1950 was imposed upon the island. As Mr. Rudy
Sablan in the Saipan Tribune, explained,
     There exists a misconception about our CNMI. Many people believe that be-
     cause we are a commonwealth, we belong to the United States, as if we are
     property or territory of the US Wrong. We don’t belong to the USA. Neither the
     US Congress, nor the US President, has yet to agree that we are a US-owned
     territory. The CNMI is not just US soil. (Chan, 2016)
Legal scholar Horey (2003) has argued that politically this has been an outcome of
the “overall federal tendency … to ignore the unique circumstances of the CNMI, and
lump it together with the traditional US territories” (p. 182). Both Mr. Tagabuel and
Mr. Sablan point out the inherent contradiction between the CNMI’s self-government
and US sovereign power over the CNMI’s political system, a paradox that continues
to frame contemporary discussions of sovereignty in the CNMI, with one prevail-
ing view being that US citizenship as a worthy trade for sovereignty. This political
history is important to re-examine in light of contemporary discussions of self-de-
termination amidst the steady growth of military planning in the region, wherein
Indigenous self-governance is couched within the framework of US sovereignty.

The Politics of Indigeneity
Contemporary media coverage of the Mariana Islands tends to center around a few
salient themes: US political controversies⁶⁰; the lack of democracy being extended
to the United States’ territorial possessions; and more recently, the devastating ef-
fects of unprecedented typhoons hitting “US soil.”⁶¹ Although seemingly disparate,
these themes overlap in complex ways and point to the inextricable links between
America’s imperial reach and its ensuing militarization of the environment. This
coverage seeks to portray a more inclusive and historically accurate representa-
tion of United States imperial history in US territories where most inhabitants are
Indigenous peoples who do not possess the same constitutional rights as American
citizens in the continental United States. It also highlights the general unfamiliarity
that most Americans have in regard to United States territories, which engenders a
sense of disbelief that such political arrangements continue to exist in today’s world
where overt forms of colonialism are no longer acceptable.

On the March 8, 2015 airing of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight,” John Oliver picked up on
this discrepancy and noted that, while
     more than four million people live in the US territories, more than 98% of them
     are racial or ethnic minorities, and the more you look into the history of why

      their voting rights are restricted, the harder it is to justify, ‘cause it goes all the
      way back to when America first acquired them. (Last Week Tonight, 2015)
By framing Indigenous people in the territories as racial or ethnic minorities that
live in places that were “acquired” by the United States, Oliver’s comments reflect
a common practice of racializing Indigenous peoples (Moreton-Robinson, 2015)
in an attempt to underscore the unequal application of democratic rights to all
Americans. While his sketch was informative of America’s imperial reach outside
the continental United States, it continues to highlight the complex political reali-
ties that Indigenous people in territories and commonwealths must negotiate under
American political hegemony that cannot be solved by voting rights.

Such perspectives portray a lack of political representation—specifically inequita-
ble voting rights⁶²—in an American system of governance as the root of the islands’
many social and economic issues. Increasingly, democratization and a growing
American consciousness are understood as the panacea to the many social and po-
litical problems facing the people of the Marianas. I argue that while the critique
of unequal political representation is well founded, it highlights state-centered
approaches to decolonization that define political and social equality through
the granting of US citizenship and incorporation—a move in which democracy is
viewed “as the ever-heralded justification and decisive promise of inclusion in set-
tler states more broadly” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 20). From this perspective, statehood is
upheld as the apex of assimilation into a seemingly homogenous American political
system—a prospect that presents itself as a legal paradox in overseas insular territo-
ries⁶³ (which include the CNMI, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa and
Puerto Rico) in which “the promise of statehood” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 16) existed but
never manifested through their designation as unincorporated.⁶⁴ As Stayman (2009,
as cited in Pöllath, 2018) points out, “The status of ‘unincorporated territory’ meant
that fundamental individual rights were protected by the Constitution, but Congress
need not extend citizenship nor extend a promise of eventual statehood” (p. 237).

Thus, militarism overlaps with the politics of indigeneity in the CNMI in a number
of important ways. First, processes of self-determination complicate the politics of
indigeneity across the archipelago, where decolonization for Chamorros in Guam,
and for Chamorros and Refaluwasch in the CNMI both overlap and diverge due to
our different colonial and political histories. Secondly, Chamorros and Refaluwasch
peoples must contend with authenticating and differentiating their indigeneity
against the background of Americanization. Indigeneity overlaps with racial politics
and highlights the influence that settler legacies of racial purity and blood quantum
have over the authentication of Indigenous peoples. Lastly, militarism forces both
groups to reckon with the sometimes tenuous and paradoxical nature of having
two groups fall within the same category of Northern Mariana Descent (NMD)—a
category that often becomes conflated with indigeneity in the CNMI.

One of the most important consequences of the differential military and political
histories of the Northern Marianas and Guam in terms of Indigenous self-determi-
nation has been the formal recognition of two groups of people into the category of
Northern Marianas Descent: the Chamorro and Refaluwasch peoples. The emer-
gence of an “Indigenous” label surfaced among Chamorros in the 1980s in Guam as
a response to issues of self-determination (Tolentino, n.d.). In the CNMI, however,
indigeneity is often conflated with the legal categorization of “Northern Marianas
Descent” which designates those individuals who meet the requirements of Article
XII in the Northern Mariana Islands Constitution. Article XII is entitled “Restrictions
on Alienation of Land” and is comprised of six main sections. In Section 4, a person
of Northern Marianas Descent is defined as,
     a citizen or national of the United States and who is of at least one-quarter
     Northern Marianas Chamorro or Northern Marianas Carolinian blood or a
     combination thereof or an adopted child of a person of Northern Marianas de-
     scent if adopted while under the age of eighteen years.

     For purposes of defining Northern Marianas descent, a person shall be con-
     sidered a full-blooded Northern Marianas Chamorro or Northern Marianas
     Carolinian if that person was born or domiciled in the Northern Mariana
     Islands by 1950 and was a citizen of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands
     before the termination of the Trusteeship with respect to the Commonwealth
     (Commonwealth Law Revision Commission, n.d.).
The definition of NMD, taken directly from the experience of the drafting of the
CNMI Constitution during the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) period,
used a combination of time, location, and political status as guidelines for identi-
fication of Indigenous peoples in the CNMI. This designation was important for
the way that it linked the deeply meaningful and ancestral ties to the land with

Indigenous people. Given the long historical use of blood quantum as a tool for
discrimination against Indigenous peoples globally, the use of blood quantum to
define NMDs might appear somewhat contradictory. However, a closer examination
reveals that the use of blood quantum to define indigeneity need not be discrimi-
natory and, in fact, can work to promote Indigenous self-determination (Villazor,
2010, p. 476). This is an important distinction to make in the context of US political
hegemony in the Pacific where Indigenous rights create counter-claims against US
constitutional rights such as “equal protection and individual rights” (Villazor, 2018,
p. 128).⁶⁵ In the CNMI, the definition of NMDs highlights the complexity of both in-
digeneity as a political and social category that intersects with a broader American
national identity and citizenship.

Given this history, the perspectives of Chamorros from Guam often do not address the
perspectives of Refaluwasch people who re-located to the Northern Mariana Islands
in the early 19th century after a massive typhoon hit their home islands (Alkire,
1984, p. 272). Despite evidence of pre-contact relationships between Carolinians
and Chamorros from Guam (Goetzfridt, n.d.), this contemporary Refaluwasch
“blind spot” is often unintentionally promulgated by scholarship about Chamorros,
particularly in Guam, where the same history between Refaluwasch is not shared.
Camacho (2011) touches on this issue when he notes that
     Guam, in their view, persists as the center of Indigenous injury, thereby fore-
     closing discussion of other “grievable” subjects in the Mariana Islands. The
     Guam-centrism is widespread. That is, the majority of the Catholic debates,
     Indigenous literatures, oral traditions, political issues, popular cultures, and
     women’s organizations representing Chamorro society almost exclusively focus
     on Guam, if not portray Chamorros as Indigenous only to this island. (p. 704)
Teasing out the socio-political differences between Guam and the Northern Mariana
Islands has the potential to shed new light on longstanding inequities that continue
to shape our relationship with one another both politically and economically, as
well as our differential relationships with the United States. Rather than an obstacle,
these differences can be a key to shaping self-determination as we negotiate var-
ious legal avenues for demilitarization and decolonization. Although outside the
scope of this discussion, the differences and similarities between Chamorro and
Refaluwasch cultures and political histories have much potential for unpacking
how colonization has influenced our understandings of indigeneity in today’s world.
As Kanaka Maoli scholar Haunani-Kay Trask (1999) points out, “Because of coloni-
zation, the question of who defines what is Native, has been taken away from Native
peoples by Western-trained scholars, government officials and other technicians”
(p. 43). In the CNMI, the shared history between Chamorros and Refaluwasch (or
mixed “Chamolinians”) remain a site of productive tension in which we can expand
our visions of Indigenous sovereignty outside the bounds of political recognition.

Conclusion
How would it be possible to exercise self-determination amidst militarization, if
only Guam—or if only the CNMI—could technically achieve this goal? What do
two different political statuses within the same archipelago mean for decoloni-
zation? In the Marianas, reconfiguring the possibilities of sovereignty are critical
to confronting United States hegemony. Critiquing the hypermilitarization of the
region is key to this confrontation because “militarism and militarization both es-
tablish the conditions of the nation-state and claim justification for their further
imperial expansion as the defense and redeployment of those conditions and calcu-
lated disposal of national sacrifice zones” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 9). Militarism works to
construct the discursive formation of such sacrifice zones, military borders, and stra-
tegic outposts as necessary to national security through the construction of insular
environments ripe for testing and training. The undoing of this particular colonial
framing of sovereignty within the Northern Marianas remains critical amidst on-
going militarization, a process which continues to uncritically invoke the islands’
political status, size, and geographic location as justification for increased mili-
tarization by presenting them as national defense necessities. This perspective also
allows us to abandon the settler logic of political incorporation and navigate us away
from the notion that more political representation in Congress necessarily equates to
increased self-determination. It does so by highlighting the primacy of Indigenous
relationships through and within our “common wealth”—that is, to recognize that
our political power lies in the relative ability to care for our ancestral lands, seas
and skies that make possible our connections to this place, rather than a vision of
militaristic consumption of island environments based on a loosely defined and
problematic ideal of a national commons. To recognize the land as an Indigenous
“common wealth” rather than a US commonwealth means to literally break apart
the term, wrest back its meanings from its imperial roots, and understand the

environment and our surroundings as a communal space that we take responsibility
for protecting rather than exploiting or extracting.

Since the first plans regarding the military build-up in the Marianas were made
public in 2005, community members throughout the Marianas expressed concerns
about militarism as an impediment to decolonization, particularly in Guam. In a
statement before the UN Special Committee on Decolonization in 2006, Guam
Senator Hope Cristobal noted the absurd situation that surrounds ideals of self-de-
termination on an island as militarized as Guam. Cristobal (2006) explained,
     The sheer number of eligible voters connected to the military, their depen-
     dents and contractors is of great concern when implementing the exercise
     of our inalienable right to self-determination in … Guam … Even more dis-
     turbing is the military’s attitude that they, too, can vote to decolonize a
     non-self-governing territory! To be sure, the military can surely determinate a
     US favorable outcome of any election.
Sen. Cristobal’s concerns echo the deeply problematic way that self-determina-
tion is framed in the context of settler colonialism, whereby the distinctiveness of
Indigenous claims are ignored in favor of a seemingly homogenous American citi-
zenship. Furthermore, increasing militarization continues to reveal discrepancies in
the way that the CNMI and Guam can engage with processes of self-determination
in their distinct political relationships and negotiations with the United States. The
collapsing of socio-political differences between the CNMI and Guam risks over-
simplifying the struggle for decolonization as one that can be framed only within
and through the confines of US legal frameworks. The argument that the CNMI
was never colonized because we were able to “choose” our political status and that
we were not a spoil of war as was Guam is testament to this oversimplification. It
restricts how we might imagine self-determination by linking decolonization to po-
litical status and depoliticizes the influence of US political power in the archipelago.
A myopic focus on political status therefore constrains possibilities for demilitarized
futures. By incorporating the land and environment into discussions of self-deter-
mination, our viewpoints shift towards a more expansive politics of sovereignty and
decolonization that is not shackled to military whims throughout Oceania.

The Evolution of Respeto (Respect) as Viewed through Three Generations of Refaluwasch (Carolinian) Families (Cinta Matagolai Kaipat)

Respeto
Respeto (respect) is one of the cornerstones of Refaluwasch (Carolinian) culture.
It dictates what is considered a culturally appropriate or inappropriate manner of
interacting with every single being we encounter. For us Refaluwasch, respeto is cru-
cial to our very survival. Based on my own personal observations, I find that there
has been a diminished sense of respeto in Refaluwasch culture with each succeeding
generation. I fear that the continuation of this trend will lead to the rapid extinction
of this important hallmark of Refaluwasch culture. Why is this important? This is
important because our culture is what makes us unique; it is what sets us apart from
other peoples of the world. Moreover, respeto helps restore peace and harmony, both
within and outside of our own Refaluwasch society. Of parallel importance is that it
promotes tipiyew—that Refaluwasch “spirit of unity”—of one heart, one mind, and
one love for all. To lose appreciation for this important Refaluwasch value threatens
the very survival of our culture and unique way of life.

My Parents’ Generation
My parents were born in the 1930s during the Japanese occupation of our Mariana
Islands. I am certain that what my parents learned about respeto growing up in their
respective households was shaped by their cultural environment, as well as later-life
influences they experienced as they matured into adulthood.

My Father
My father was born to a Refaluwasch father and a Chamorro mother on the island
of Agrigan (also called Agrihan), one of our remote islands north of Saipan in the
Northern Islands of our Marianas archipelago. Agrigan was populated almost ex-
clusively by Refaluwasch at the time my father and his family lived there. That is
where my paternal grandparents chose to live and raise a family. My father was the
second to the youngest child in a family of six boys and one girl.

He was a schoolteacher, a song composer, a farmer, a medic, a traditional local
healer, a public official, and a congressman. In his younger years, he worked as a
cook on a ship. My father had the privilege of traveling abroad to pursue his edu-
cation in places such as Chuuk in Micronesia, Fiji, Hawai‘i, and Japan. I am certain
this experience further shaped his worldview and helped him become a better com-
munity leader in service to our people upon his return home from studying abroad.
His exposure to the outside world honed his skills as a diplomat, enabling him to
navigate skillfully between the more modern world he ventured into and the more
traditional world he had been raised in.

My father was also a visionary who was ahead of his time. He believed in developing
our islands’ natural resources and held strongly to the belief that the peoples’ skills
had to be developed as well as this was a key element in the communities’ achieving
self-sufficiency and economic prosperity. My father returned to Saipan in the early
1960s after completing his studies at the University of Hawai‘i where he majored in
agriculture. He was subsequently hired to help run the Agriculture Program in the
Marianas during the Trust Territory era which began after WWII. It was then that
he moved our family from Agrigan to Saipan. I was the youngest of five children
born at that time. In Saipan, we lived in isolation in Chacha, as Kagman Village was
still an undeveloped farm area back then. My father held this position until he was
persuaded to run for political office to represent our people of the Northern Islands.

He won a seat in the Legislature and moved our family back to the Northern Islands
and resettled us in Pagan (pronounced “Puhgan”) in the latter part of July 1968. By
this time, our family had expanded to seven children.

Although my father was one of the most highly educated men of his time—espe-
cially for a Refaluwasch or a Refaluwasch-Chamorro—he did not limit himself to
playing the traditional male role common in Refaluwasch society. On the contrary,
upon returning from one of his trips to Saipan to attend a Congressional session, or
when he would return home after an off-island trip to Japan or Hawai‘i to engage
his contemporaries on agricultural matters, he was often seen carrying one of my
younger siblings on one hip while stirring a pot on the stove. He even improvised a
wood-burning oven so that he could bake bread!

I was 10 years old when we tragically lost my father. He was murdered in April 1972,
while protecting a constituent who sought refuge at our house one night following
a domestic dispute. I mention my father’s death because I include in this writing
what I learned from him about respeto as I was growing up, although most of the
discussions on this subject will be lessons passed on by my beloved mother, who
lived to the age of 75, just 2 months shy of her 76th birthday, before we lost her,
too, in April 2010.

My Mother
My mother was born in Saipan to Refaluwasch parents. She was raised by a single
mother. She was an only child before a half-sister came along a few years later. It
would be a few more years later before her mother would marry and give birth to
her youngest half-sister and half-brother. Mom began her formal education during
the Japanese administration. She got as far as second grade under the Japanese ed-
ucation system. Like a typical Refaluwasch family, my mother grew up in a humble
home where money was hard to come by. Her mother was a tall curly-haired stern
woman. Much of her beliefs and teachings were passed on to her by my maternal
grandmother and other relatives.

My mother’s family lived in Chalan Kanoa in Saipan prior to moving to Agrigan
after the end of WWII. As the eldest, she helped take care of her younger siblings.
Mom worked hard to take care of her family. She continued this “life work” after she

and my father were married and started a family. She was pregnant with her tenth
child when my father was killed. While she never took a job outside the house, the
“life work” my mother assumed raising all 10 children on her own after my father’s
death was nothing short of remarkable. She was the glue that held us together when
our world was suddenly shattered after my father’s death. We owe my mother a debt
of gratitude that can never ever be repaid. She was an incredibly strong role model
who believed in and lived by the Golden Rule. There is no doubt that she left the
biggest influence in shaping our lives.

My Generation
My siblings were born in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. I was born in 1961. I am fond
of sharing this piece of trivia with new friends. I tell them that the number 5 plays
a significant role in my life. For starters, my parents had five boys and five girls.
After having five of us, they waited five years before they had five more children.
I am the fifth child of the 10 children born to my parents. Five of us were deliv-
ered at home on Agrigan by our Chamorro grandmother and, finally, I was the fifth
child that she delivered.

Speaking of my grandparents, unfortunately, all had passed away by the time I was
old enough to know and appreciate them. I am sure I would have learned a lot from
them. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my father’s tragic death when I was 10 years old
not only deprived me of a father, but also robbed me of the opportunity to learn
so much from him. Hence, most of what I learned about Refaluwasch culture and
respeto came from my mother as well as other relatives. I thank God for my mother
and all the relatives who took the time to instill Refaluwasch values and lessons,
such as respeto, in me and my siblings.

The Next Generation
Members of the next generation include my numerous nieces and nephews
in my immediate family, as well as other relatives who were born in the 1970s,
1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.

I. Ttong (Kissing of the Hand)
One of the first things children are taught to do in order to show respeto is to kiss
the right hand of a parent or older relatives. When meeting relatives who are a
generation or more above you (either while visiting or after church), the first act in
paying respeto is to walk up to that individual, gently take and raise his or her right
hand towards your nose as you bend down and kiss the hand and say “Ñora” if the
person to whom you are according respeto is a female or “Ñot” if the person is a
male. These are Spanish-origin Chamorro words. I am sure that this practice was
something picked up from our Spanish colonizers who conquered and subjugated
my Chamorro ancestors in the 1600s. That my Refaluwasch ancestors share this
customary act of showing respeto means that they, too, did not escape Spanish subju-
gation even though they did not settle in the Marianas permanently until the 1800s.

Refalowasch call this act of according respeto by kissing the hand “ttong.” This act
is also very important in paying respeto to one’s godparents. Being blessed after
kissing the hand—with the person bestowing the blessing touching the head and
replying “Liyoos faiyéégh” (God bless you)—is culturally important. It is an import-
ant symbolic gesture of an ongoing relationship based on respeto. In fact, one of the
baptismal godparents will also be the godparent at the godchild’s wedding. If the
godchild is a female, then the godmother will be involved in the wedding ceremony,
and vice versa if the godchild is a male.

There are certain situations when a “proxy godparent” may be called upon to fill in
for the actual godparent. For instance, when one of my father’s godsons was about to
get married, he came to our house and asked if my eldest brother could stand in as a
proxy for my father as he knew that my father had long since passed away. Another
situation where the “proxy godparent” may be called in is if the actual godparent is
either off-island or too ill to attend the wedding ceremony.

My Parents’ Generation
While I did not see my father engage in this customary respectful act of ttong while
I was growing up in the Northern Islands, I am certain that he performed this act
whenever he met up with his aunts and uncles living in Saipan. As to my mother,
I did have many chances to observe her engage in this practice when we moved to
Saipan permanently in 1972 right after my father was killed.

My Generation									
One of the earliest teachings instilled in us by my parents to accord respeto was to

“åmen” or “ttong” whenever we met a relative who was my parents’ contemporary
or older. Failure to accord respeto was not tolerated. This was all well and good if
one knew who amongst the relatives were due to be accorded this act of respeto.
However, it gets complicated when you find yourself in a crowd of people feeling
bashful because you do not really know to whom to accord this respectful act.

I recall my personal experience with this very dilemma. I was 16 when I left home for
Chicago to pursue my education. I finally moved back home after attending school
and living and working in the States for almost 20 years. Unfortunately, my long
absence from home made attempts to re-assimilate back into my community chal-
lenging. I often found myself in awkward and embarrassing situations wherein I did
not know most of the people surrounding me at social gatherings or at other public
functions, including members of my Refaluwasch community. To play it safe and
avoid offending anyone, I mistakenly decided to “åmen” or “ttong” the folks who
had gray hair. I assumed they had to be a generation older than me and, therefore,
worthy of the respectful gesture. However, that was not a fail-proof method. Much
to my chagrin, I ended up having gray-haired folks yank their hands away from me
in exasperation. However, some did laugh at me, but, thankfully, they also took the
opportunity to educate me and point out that we were contemporaries and so it
was, therefore, inappropriate for me to engage in the respectful practice of “ttong”
with them. Nevertheless, some others believe that receiving a blessing—albeit from
a contemporary—is still a good thing.

The Next Generation
No doubt that unless the practice of ttong is taught and reinforced as the children
are growing up, this would not be something that the next generation would au-
tomatically value and appreciate and, therefore, feel compelled to perform as
appropriate. This generation either ignores this significant cultural component of
showing respeto to one’s elders or their godparents. Of those who do observe this
practice, I would say that, with few exceptions, a vast majority of them complete the
act of ttong in a perfunctory manner. For example, my generation would approach
the relative or godparent, reach for and raise the right hand while bending down to
kiss it and say “Ñiot” or “Ñiora” and then wait for the relative or godparent to put his
or her hand on our heads and bless us. Disappointingly, I have observed a number
of members of the next generation opt to ttong from a distance, if at all. They simply
approach and bend over from a few feet away and say “Ñiora” without walking up to
hold the hand and kiss it and wait for the blessing.

Another dramatic departure from the traditional hand kissing in ttong that I have
observed in this generation is the quick peck on the cheek while saying “Ñiora.” We
know that this is a customary greeting in many other countries, including the United
States. But, while there is nothing wrong with this manner of greeting friends and
loved ones, the symbolic act of kissing the hand in ttong is done for a completely
different purpose—to accord respeto and to receive a blessing in return. Today, this
important cultural act of according respeto and receiving a blessing in return has
somehow morphed into a mere greeting with a peck on the cheek. Again, I empha-
size that the two are not interchangeable. They are mutually exclusive—each done
for a completely different purpose.

For obvious reasons, I am not a fan of this trend, as it takes away from the signifi-
cance of what is supposed to be a meaningful mutual exchange of paying respect
and receiving a blessing in return. A peck on the cheek is simply that—a greet-
ing—which is different from and does not equate to ttong, which is the giving of
respect and then receiving a blessing in return. Thinking about this issue opened
my eyes to how my mother must have felt whenever my siblings and I failed to live
up to her expectations of how we ought to practice and observe respeto in all its
various forms and nuances.

II. Rankings by Gender and Birth Order
Refaluwasch society is a matrilineal society wherein the eldest woman within each
clan is entrusted with the powerful position of being the “trustee of the family land.”
Despite this, the plain fact is that men still outrank women in Refaluwasch society.
This is just the way it is and has been this way for many, many generations. The man
is the head of the household. Male children outrank female children. Sisters are
taught to respect their brothers and to act in a respectful manner toward them, such
as using respectful language when speaking to them or about them and monitoring
their behavior to remain respectful at all times. Conversely, the men are expected
to be mindful of their language and behavior around their sisters to ensure that
respeto is also observed at all times.

But this is not the only ranking system that must be followed. Another ranking
system also exists within each gender. If there are five brothers, for example, the
eldest brother would outrank the younger brothers and so forth on down the peck-
ing order. This is the same with sisters. In theory, this is the way things are supposed
to work. However, within my parents’ generation, younger male siblings still accord
their older female siblings respeto in the same manner that they would accord res-
peto to older male siblings. This, too, is proper and acceptable. While this may seem
like a contradiction, I say it is more of an exception rather than a contradiction.

These rankings apply to other relatives as well. If one were to look at a family tree,
the children of the eldest male relative would outrank the children born to younger
siblings and the rankings would extend down the family tree to the very last branch.
The next in line in terms of this ranking system would be the children of the second
eldest male and so forth. Finally, after the children of the youngest male would come
the children of the oldest female. The rankings continue with the children of the
second oldest female, then down to the children of the youngest female being last.

These ranking systems can get complicated, and some might even say it is a convo-
luted system that is impossible to truly grasp. However, serious attempts at learning
and understanding these systems are important, as one must do everything possi-
ble to avoid offending anyone and shaming the family. For example, it would be
highly improper for the children of any younger sibling to ask the children of the
older male siblings to perform any chores for them. Yet, it is perfectly appropriate
for the children of the older siblings to ask the children of the younger siblings to
perform chores for them. This applies to the rest of the families on down the line.
Hence, knowing such rankings is crucial in “saving face,” as to act improperly or
disrespectfully would bring shame and dishonor to the family. Obviously, this is to
be avoided at all costs.

My Parents’ Generation
I recall that my father always remained respectful of his siblings, including his only
sister who was older than him. Again, this was the exception I mentioned earlier
about brothers according respeto to their sisters as well, which is perfectly accept-
able. This same deference also extended to my father’s relatives. Also, as I mentioned
above, my mother was the oldest child in her family, so I saw her younger siblings,
including my uncle who was the youngest child in my mother’s family, accord my
mother a lot of deference. My mother practiced the Refaluwasch customs of awóówó
(respectful language) and appwóro (respectful behavior) where my uncle was con-
cerned, and so both accorded respeto toward one another. My mother also accorded
respeto to her other male relatives.

My Generation
In my family, the ranking system was also observed in terms of recognizing that our
eldest brother commanded the highest respeto of all. All of us accorded him the
respeto that he was entitled to by virtue of his birth order, as well as the fact that
he was also a male. But while our mother and other relatives attempted to teach us
women to practice the custom of appwóro to accord respeto to all our brothers, with
few exceptions, my generation was less rigid in applying this practice, if at all. For
instance, in my immediate family, none of my brothers was ever required to stand
up in order for us to pass by. However, my brothers would definitely stand up for our
female cousins who were practicing appwóro. Nevertheless, my sisters and I also
understood that we should not and would not walk past our brothers or other male
relatives if they were sitting on the floor without first politely asking them to get
up off the floor and at least sit in a chair while we walk past them. My other male
siblings who are younger than our eldest male sibling are also expected to observe
the same practice when it comes to our eldest brother and so forth down the line.

The Next Generation
In our family, we were met with mediocre results when trying to teach the ranking
system to our children. The next generation lives in a far different world than my
generation or my parents’ generation lived in.

III. Kkapasal Faluwasch
In Refaluwasch culture, there is an everyday language that everyone uses. We call
this language “kappasal falwasch” (language of our island). While kappasal falu-
wasch may be used among peers and in communications between older and younger
generations, depending on the family’s respeto practices that rank family members,
there may be limitations or variations in how widely this everyday language is used.

For example, some Refaluwasch families are more traditional than others; there-
fore, they may adhere to a more rigid custom of speaking kappasal faluwasch when
addressing certain individuals to avoid being disrespectful in their manner of com-
munication. For instance, kappasal faluwasch may be peppered with the respectful
language of awóówó where appropriate to accord respeto to whomever the intended
audience is. Some may also use kappasal faluwasch when they are in the exclusive
presence of their respective gender’s company, where the rigidity and importance of
choosing one’s words carefully is far more relaxed. Yet, another situation in which
kappasal faluwasch is spoken without peppering it with awóówó is communica-
tion between spouses.

My Parents’ Generation
Regarding my parents, I know that they communicated with each other in kappasal
faluwasch. There was no requirement for either of them to speak the language of
awóówó when communicating with each other.

My Generation
My generation’s first spoken language is also kappasal faluwasch. Both parents
spoke to us in kappasal faluwasch and we also spoke it amongst each other, as well
as with friends and relatives.

The Next Generation
Cultural advocates and preservationists say, “You lose your language, you lose your
culture.” I believe this is true. Perhaps in our zeal to push our children to excel in
school, where English is the only language taught and spoken in virtually all subjects,
we began speaking English to our children at home almost to the exclusion of our own
Refaluwasch language. This was and IS a big mistake. I believe this has shortchanged
our children’s opportunity to learn their first language at home while simultane-
ously learning English in school. The addition of the television in our homes also
contributed to the replacement of our Refaluwasch language with English. While it
is good that our toddlers learn to speak English while watching children’s shows on
televisions, iPads and cell phones, imagine how much better it would have been if our
children also watched similar programs in our own Native languages.

Additionally, almost all the books the kids read in school are written in English.
Consequently, it became more and more of a struggle and almost a losing battle to
attempt to teach the Refaluwasch language to the next generation, who seemed to
have less and less interest in learning the language. When you speak in kappasal fa-
luwasch to members of the next generation, you are more likely to be met with blank
stares or question marks written on their faces as they are often virtually clueless as
to what you are saying to them. If you speak to them in kappasal faluwasch, some
will respond in English with, “I don’t understand what you’re saying.” When this
became apparent in our own family decades ago, one of my brothers, who opened
my eyes as well as the eyes of some of our other siblings, decided that it was time to
take drastic measures to stem and reverse the tide.

To do this, we decided that whenever our nieces or nephews would call the house,
we would say “Refaluwasch” once they began speaking in English. This startled
them at first. In fact, we endured weeks of their stammering on the phone, followed
by silence that culminated in the kids hanging up on us in frustration. However, a
line had been drawn, and, for everyone’s sake, especially our children’s, it was im-
portant to stand our ground. My brother even required some of the younger kids in
our family to begin writing daily journals in Refaluwasch about what happened in
school. This made for some hilarious reading, but the kids got the point.

Of course, it did not happen overnight, but eventually, it began to pay off. Today,
these once-young members of the next generation are fluent in kappasal faluwasch
and those who have become parents are now able to pass on kappasal faluwasch
to their own children.

Although we averted the total loss of kappasal faluwasch in the next generation in
our immediate family (and perhaps other families might have also met with sim-
ilar success), unfortunately, there are still some gaps. Ongoing efforts to teach our
children kappasal faluwasch must continue. We know that some parents of my
generation still speak English exclusively or almost exclusively to their children
who were born in the next generation. My hope is that we make every effort to col-
lectively encourage and remind such parents that their assistance and cooperation
in this regard are crucial. I am mindful, however, that this effort to preserve our

indigenous language will succeed only if the parents believe it is something valuable
and worth preserving.

With optimism, I can say that not all is lost. I cannot emphasize this enough—we
MUST bring back our bilingual classes to our schools. At one time, our Public School
System offered bilingual classes which, in my opinion, proved to be invaluable in pro-
viding many young children with some kappasal faluwasch lessons that they were
not exposed to at home. It was far better than nothing. Ideally, kappasal faluwasch
lessons ought to begin at home and should be reinforced or augmented in school, as
well as through other community programs that could be offered or sponsored by the
Carolinian Affairs Office, the Indigenous Office, the Language Policy Commission, or
some other programs funded both locally and federally. I also understand that there
were some schools in our Public School System that offered language immersion
classes as part of their bilingual classes. I applaud this move and believe should be
revived with the return of our bilingual programs to our schools.

IV. Awóówó
There is a respectful language in Refaluwasch culture called “awóówó.” This hon-
orific language must be used to accord respeto when interacting with certain family
members, as well as members of the general public. This language is also essential
in communicating with male relatives, including older relatives who must be ac-
corded respeto. The same applies to communicating with children. However, it is
not appropriate to apply the honorific language of awóówó to oneself. For example,
in the everyday language of kappasal faluwasch, a person may say “Ibwe mwongo”
(I’m going to eat), but one may not apply the awóówó language when referring to
oneself by saying “Ibwe ilitiyáy.”

Moreover, when inviting someone to eat, one might say in kappasal faluwasch “Itto
mwongo” (Come eat), depending on whom the person is addressing. For instance,
an older sister may say this to her younger sister or perhaps an older brother may
say this to a younger brother. However, a Refaluwasch woman may never use such
language to invite her brother, parents, older relatives, a child, or members of the
public to eat, as that would be very impolite. So, instead, she must use the respectful
language of awóówó and say “Itto ilitúgh” (Come eat) if she were addressing a single
person. If she were inviting individuals from any of the aforementioned categories
of persons, however, she would say “Aw itto ilitúghámi” (Come eat, everyone). When
addressing a child, she would say “Itto mamma” (Come eat), and if she were address-
ing more than one child, she would say “Aw itto mamma” (Come eat, everyone).

My Parents’ Generation
Generally speaking, whenever my parents communicated with others, they would
speak in kappasal faluwasch, although awóówó was also spoken whenever the
situation dictated such. And, while I did not observe my father speak the awóówó
language, I certainly observed my mother utilizing this language in her everyday
communications with family members. As explained above, rankings do play an
important role in how awóówó is used. So, while my mother was required to use
the language of awóówó at all times in communicating with her brothers, elders,
relatives, and members of the public, she was not required to use awóówó when
communicating with her younger sisters because, as the eldest female in her family,
my mother outranked her two younger sisters. However, my mother’s younger sis-
ters were required to address her in the language of awóówó.

My Generation
My generation speaks the everyday kappasal faluwasch with some words of awóówó
when called for. However, I know that the awóówó language is spoken less and
less frequently. Despite my mother’s best efforts to teach us awóówó, it is my firm
belief that unless the language is spoken regularly in the house, it is easy to lose
it—assuming one acquired it to begin with. This is why I see fewer and fewer people
speaking awóówó today. In other words, there needs to be a constant teaching and
reinforcement of this awóówó language for it to remain relevant and to prevent it
from fading into obscurity. If we do not use it, we lose it. It is as simple as that.

I know that there is great admiration for those who still speak awóówó today. This
is especially true of children. Children who speak awóówó today garner high praise
and much respect and admiration for themselves as well as their families. There is
this belief that a child who speaks awóówó is a child who has been brought up right.
Though admirable for the respeto values it promotes, one of the reasons awóówó
is losing its popularity with each generation is that it is a difficult language to un-
derstand and master. English has become a necessary language of education and
modern-day survival. It is the world’s common language used to connect peoples

of all walks of life from practically every nation on Earth. Thus, unlike my parents’
generation and previous generations, there is more emphasis on teaching and learn-
ing English as opposed to teaching and learning awóówó.

The Next Generation
For those members of the next generation who are proficient in awóówó, I commend
them and their parents or relatives who imparted such knowledge to them. They
are rare gems. This shows that there are some members of the next generation who
value our culture enough to invest in learning about our culture and languages.
They made sure they spent quality time with their elders who effectively imparted
such knowledge to them. They are the stewards who keep the cultural links connect-
ed. This is a very worthwhile endeavor.

One such steward I have met and interviewed is an impressive young man in
his mid-20s who is able to write and speak eloquently in both Chamorro and
Refaluwasch. He epitomizes the bright hope for the future and is a credit to the next
generation. After I spoke with him, this young gentleman revealed to me that his
desire to preserve his Refaluwasch and Chamorro heritage was inspired by Lieweila:
A Micronesian Story, the historical cultural documentary film that I co-produced
and released in 1998 with Dr. Beret E. Strong, her husband John Tweedy, Esq.,
and my brother, Gus. The film traces the emigration of my Refaluwasch ancestors
from the central Carolines to the Marianas in the 1800s. Led by Chief Aghurubw
and two other chiefs, the Marianas is where they resettled after they were forced to
escape from earthquakes, floods and devastating typhoons. The film also traces my
Refaluwasch ancestors’ shared history with my Chamorro ancestors under various
colonial regimes that ruled the Marianas, starting with the Spanish, followed by the
Germans, the Japanese and then the Americans.

This particular young man had an impressive appreciation and knowledge of both
his Chamorro and Refaluwasch cultures and languages. He speaks and writes in
both languages fluently, which has garnered even more respect and admiration from
me. I conducted my interview with him via social media and immediately regretted
not having met him in person before he returned to the States to care for his elderly
grandparents. I would say that this young man represented the exception rather
than the rule. He especially impressed me with his command and use of awóówó as
we conversed, as well as his understanding of respeto and the importance of using
appropriate language in public debates, such as on social media.

The young man caught my attention when I first read his comments on social media
reminding another individual of the importance of minding our language in public
debates. He spoke of how disappointed our elders would have been had they heard
the coarse language being used in public debates today. When I asked him about
this, he lamented that someone told him a long time ago that if he truly wanted to
learn about his culture, then he would have to go and live with the elders who could
teach him what he needed to learn. And that is exactly what he did. That he was
able to confidently use his knowledge and maturity to remind or teach others how
to communicate properly in public is a testament to the fine job that his elders had
done in imparting valuable life lessons to him. This is truly commendable on the
part of the student and his teachers.

Within my own family, the members of the next generation are communicating in
kappasal faluwasch mixed with some English, though we continue to encourage
them to use kappasal falwasch as the main language at home. Unfortunately,
their knowledge and use of awóówó is still somewhat limited, but some are
making some progress.

V. Off-color Jokes and Cuss Words
In Refaluwasch culture, there is a divide between proper male and female behav-
iors that dictates what each gender ought to say and how each should behave. This
is done to accord mutual respeto to one another and to avoid committing cultur-
al taboos. For example, men and women must never tell off-color jokes in mixed
company. Men and women may use provocative language to tell jokes, but such lan-
guage must be restricted to the privacy of same-gender gatherings. To do otherwise
is taboo. The rationale behind this is that violating this taboo will erode respeto.
For brothers and sisters, maintaining respeto is especially important and something
that must be safeguarded at all times.

Refaluwasch people also believe that respeto demands that one never use cuss
words with one’s parents, brothers, elder sisters, or young children. Of course, it is
considered in poor taste and taboo to cuss in public. Not only would cussing be

a breach of respeto, but it is also believed that sisters should never cuss out their
brothers as this could result in dire consequences for the brothers. Why? This is
because Refaluwasch people believe that a woman’s words are very strong and pow-
erful and, therefore, directing cuss words at one’s brother could potentially bring
some illness upon him. It is tantamount to casting a curse upon one’s brother. In
some instances, it is believed that this may even lead to sickness and death.

Additionally, such risqué language and jokes must also be avoided in the presence of
elders and children. There is a reason that gender segregation exists in Refaluwasch
society when people are socializing. This is done to avoid the risk of offending
anyone with “loose” language in a more relaxed atmosphere, especially in situations
where alcohol is involved and there is typically a lot of teasing and joking around,
sometimes using cuss words and delving into subject matters that are best not dis-
cussed in mixed company. Hence, both genders accept that there are certain cultural
practices both genders must observe in order to preserve respeto. Thus, gender seg-
regation is one way of upholding and ensuring respeto.

Moreover, Refaluwasch people believe that there is a strong correlation between
what one might say and how one might act. Thus, if the genders communicate in a
respectful language to each other, then a corresponding respectful behavior towards
one another follows. Conversely, if the males or females do not accord each other
proper respectful language, then the erosion or lack of respeto amongst the two may
inevitably lead to risqué behavior, which is forbidden in Refaluwasch society. This
is a fine line that must never ever be crossed. To do so brings with it “loss of face” and
shame to the families on both sides.

My Parents’ Generation
For obvious reasons, my parents would not or did not engage in any of these types of
joking and teasing, much less cussing. Otherwise, such behaviors would have regis-
tered in my or my siblings’ conscious memories. The fact that my memory is devoid
of any personal anecdotes where one or both of my parents either engaged in hurl-
ing cuss words at each other or at others or telling risqué jokes in mixed company or
in public arenas assures me that they both acted properly and responsibly. This says
a lot given that both of my parents were known for their great sense of humor and
quick wit. My father was also quite a prankster, though all in good, clean fun. My
mother was also quick with a smile. She liked to laugh, tease and joke as well. But as
I said, throughout the years, I never saw either parent act inappropriately.

My Generation
My generation is also expected to operate within the same cultural constraints that
prohibit the telling of off-color jokes or using cuss words in much the same way
as my parents’ generation or previous generations. However, there were some in-
stances I was privy to where I would say that there were lapses in good judgment.
For example, I once observed a fellow Refaluwasch woman going along with and
engaging in sharing off-color jokes with our male Chamorro colleagues at a social
gathering in order to fit in. This made me uncomfortable as a Refaluwasch woman,
but it was not my place to say anything to her. In this regard, my Refaluwasch culture
clashed with my Chamorro culture in a major way.

In my Chamorro culture, sharing off-color jokes in mixed company is perfectly fine.
In fact, the more you engage in it, the more you are accepted into the circle. However,
this is the antithesis of how to fit in in my Refaluwasch culture. It is one of the big
taboos that my Refaluwasch culture preaches directly against. I have also personally
experienced this culture clash.

Several years ago, while briefly working for the same employer as one of my
brothers, we ended up finding ourselves in the most awkward and embarrassing
situations whenever our Chamorro co-workers would tell off-color jokes with the
two of us present in the same room. Obviously, we could not stop our Chamorro
colleagues from telling such jokes, which they considered to be harmless and all
in good fun. But, in order to minimize such awkward situations and adhere to our
own Refaluwasch cultural values, my brother and I made a point of taking turns
leaving the room periodically whenever we were in social gatherings. This way,
our colleagues continued to enjoy themselves without my brother and me being
embarrassed. Perhaps this solution may seem drastic, but to us, it was a necessary
compromise that worked for us.

On another matter, I have also come across a number of folks in my generation who
sometimes post on social media to blast an anonymous person they were angry at
using strong cuss words that were disturbing and embarrassing. Not only is this in

poor taste, but it often reflected poorly on the very person or persons launching
the attacks. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, have shrunk the world by
connecting everyone from near and far in this virtual world. However, when used
improperly, social media can give some a false sense of courage. It emboldens some
to spew hate and disrespectful language online, which the individuals might think
twice about doing in person. When used properly, social media can be a great tool for
the education of others and staying connected with friends and loved ones. However,
when used carelessly, it can become a formidable weapon of cultural destruction. It
goes without saying that the key here is to use social media responsibly.

The Next Generation
As much as we do our best to teach our children about awóówó and other respect-
ful manners, unfortunately, like adults, they also sometimes exhibit lapses in good
judgement and engage in inappropriate joking. For example, I believe that the
popularity of explicit or vulgar rap music has had a negative impact on younger
generations. Music is one way in which children acquire language and without the
expletives in popular music, our children would probably not have this type of lan-
guage or speech in their daily vocabularies. Western comedians are also partly to
blame. Comedy using foul language attracts younger generations who get caught up
in the humor of the jokes, regardless of the way they may run counter to the values
within their own culture.

Again, I reiterate that social media plays a role in the erosion of respeto by
providing an easy and convenient vehicle with a built-in audience in which one
can log-in and spew hatred and foul language in the relative comfort of one’s
home with almost total impunity. This not something that the impressionable next
generation ought to emulate.

VI. Addressing Elders and Children
In our Refaluwasch culture, elders and children are to be addressed using respectful
language at all times. However, there is a slight variation in the respectful language
that is used to communicate with elders versus that which is used to communicate
with children. For example, the word “mamma” (eat) is often used when commu-
nicating with children. As stated earlier, to invite an adult to eat, one ought to use
the polite word “ilitúgh” (eat) or “yááyá” (partake). However, over time, the same
word used to invite children to eat—“mamma”—has gained acceptance while
communicating with elders or visitors in general. Again, generally speaking, the
use of the word “mwongo” (eat) when addressing everyone else but oneself is con-
sidered very impolite.

My Parents’ Generation
While I did not observe my father use the language of awóówó while I was growing
up, my mother certainly utilized the awóówó language extensively whenever she
communicated with elders or children.

My Generation
My generation still uses awóówó to communicate with elders and children, so the
practice continues. However, there may be some irregularities depending on the
household one is brought up in. In other words, if the parents or a parent teaches
awóówó to their children as they are growing up, then they would most likely use
this tool. Otherwise, if the children were never exposed to awóówó, then they would
not use it. With regard to my own immediate family, my mother did her part to instill
awóówó lessons in us with varying degrees of success. I can state unequivocally that I
know a lot more and also a lot less about speaking awóówó than some of my siblings.

The Next Generation
With some exceptions, the next generation is generally lacking in the knowledge of
awóówó, which leads me to my earlier point expressing that many parents do not
teach this respectful language in the home as often as previous generations have.
However, teaching awóówó to the next generation is not as simple as one might think
given that English has become the preferred language within many of Refaluwasch
homes today. I attribute this to the home environment having changed drastically in
numerous ways for many members of the next generation.

For one thing, having both parents working to earn a living outside the house meant
that the next generation is being raised by foreign houseworkers who speak English,
not Refaluwasch, to the children. Another reason is that, in our zeal to propel our-
selves forward in keeping pace with modern society, we have imported beliefs from
other cultures without considering what consequences this might have on our re-
spective cultures in our communities. For instance, we thought it was a good idea

to build a Manåmku’ (Senior Citizens) Center to provide a place where our elders
could gather socially. However, the unintended disadvantage was that this took the
elders out of their family homes and resulted in lost opportunities for them to in-
teract with younger generations on a daily basis. Thus, a number of children were
deprived of prime opportunities to learn awóówó and other valuable lessons of our
Refaluwasch culture from their elders.

Another challenge is that there are more mixed marriages between Refaluwasch
and persons from other countries, including the United States. Obviously, English
is the primary language used to communicate in our diverse society, and, unless
efforts are made by either parent to teach the children their respective languages,
English will be the only language spoken by the children. In such situations, even
the most fluent speaker of awóówó would be hard-pressed to force awóówó lessons
on the English-speaking children who may not have the slightest inclination to
learn the language. As the popular saying goes, “You can lead a horse to water, but
you can’t make it drink.”

VII. “Bostus” or “Tarapaas” Language or Behavior
In situations where someone callously spews disrespectful language or acts in an
indecent manner without regard to audience or venue, this behavior is often met
with heavy criticism and scorn as this definitely goes against everything that one is
taught about practicing respeto. I have heard this manner of speaking being referred
to as “bostus” (rough) or “tarapaas” (scattered). For example, in a public setting, if
one were to invite everyone to eat, one should never use the everyday language of
kappasal falwasch and say “Aw itto mwongo” (Come eat, everyone) for that would
be frowned upon and the speaker would be denounced as being very disrespect-
ful for using bostus or tarapaas language. Whether in gatherings at home or in a
public arena, but most especially when in a public setting, the speaker must always
accord respeto by addressing the people using the respectful language of awóówó.
The host or hostess may say something like “Sa yááya milikka pattiisch” (Let’s all
partake in our feast).

My Parents’ Generation
In all my years with my parents, not once did I ever see them act in this bostus or
tarapaas manner that would have brought shame to the family. As a matter of fact,
this is precisely the type of unacceptable behavior that my mother would have been
horrified to see any family member engage in.

My Generation
My parents endeavored to teach and mold us into model citizens and to behave in
a manner that would not dishonor our family. Family pride was very important to
them and they instilled this value in all of us. Therefore, they would be aghast if we
were to engage in speech or behavior that would be considered bostus or tarapaas.

However, like other generations, my generation is also vulnerable to the influences
of alcohol. We know that alcohol can have negative influences on people’s behav-
iors regardless if they are at home or out in public. Therefore, some people—male
or female—under the influence of alcohol may be susceptible to engaging in such
bostus or tarapaas speech or behavior that they normally would not engage in
when sober. It goes without saying that we must be mindful at all times that we
must all endeavor to use alcohol responsibly, whether in social settings or while
driving on our highways.

The Next Generation
I believe that one’s family and upbringing play a major role in how one is expected to
behave in public or in family social gatherings. The next generation must be guided
and encouraged to walk the straight and narrow path. Not surprisingly, the absence
of proper guidance or positive role models in a child’s life may manifest itself in
socially unacceptable language and behavior that are labeled bostus or tarapaas.

Unfortunately, alcohol is not the only threat to the success of the next generation.
While teenage drinking is something that is common amongst the members of the
next generation, another threat that preys on such young lives is drugs. Peer pressure
is the devil in disguise. As a former prosecutor, I was privy to sad situations in which
I saw members of the next generation throw their lives and future away by getting
involved in alcohol, drugs and petty crime because they lacked a stable home en-
vironment and a family support system to nurture and guide them. Unfortunately,
unless these basic needs are met, such troubled members of the next generation will
be prone to engage in tarapaas behaviors and bostus speech.

VIII. Appwóro (To Respectfully Bow Down)
Just as there is a respectful language called awóówó, another way to accord respeto
is in how both genders conform their behaviors toward one another. Refaluwasch
call this “appwóro” (to respectfully bow down). For example, it is a cultural taboo
for a sister to walk upright and past her brother upon entering a room while he
is sitting down. For the sister to properly and respectfully proceed, she would first
humbly ask her brother to stand up before she enters the room. Of course, if her
brother were alert and saw his sister approaching, he would have taken his cue to
stand up before she arrived to accord his sister proper respeto in return. Standing
to accord a lady respeto upon her entering a room is analogous to the chivalrous
act of a Western gentleman who stands up when a woman enters a room. We see
this depicted in Western movies or television shows often. With that said, the same
appwóro requirements do not apply to the sister’s children with regard to their uncle
(the mother’s brother).

Under certain circumstances, when it is impossible for a brother stand up, such as
when a brother in bed due to an illness, his sister is expected to approach him or go
past him on her knees or, in some instances, crawl past him on all fours until she is
some distance away before resuming her upright standing position. In other cases,
however, the sister would refrain altogether from entering the room upon seeing
her brother lying on the floor. Moreover, consideration is also accorded to persons
with disabilities who need to be accommodated with chairs or a raised seat. Again,
a person who adheres to the proper requirements of appwóro not only garners im-
mediate respeto for himself or herself, but also extend respeto to the person’s family.

Appwóro is also practiced in public settings. For example, during wakes, family
members (such as elder women and children) usually gather on mats on the floor
and sit around the coffin. It is customary that a woman, whether young or old, who
enters a room must never simply enter assuming a regular upright posture, but
must show respeto by bowing upon entering the room, by walking on her knees,
or by crawling to join family members sitting around the coffin. Failure to accord
respeto this way should be avoided, since such behavior is frowned upon. I cannot
emphasize this point enough—behaving in a disrespectful manner not only casts
aspersions on the character of the “offender,” but also reflects poorly on the of-
fender’s family. This is because people will assume that the family was negligent
in teaching proper manners of respeto to the “offender.” Otherwise, the “offender”
would have known better.

My Parents’ Generation
Perhaps it is because I lost my father when I was only 10 years old and was, there-
fore, deprived of the joy of a life lived with him that I have no specific knowledge
or recollection of him ever practicing appwóro. My mother, on the other hand,
most definitely practiced appwóro throughout her life. She not only practiced ap-
pwóro with her youngest brother, but also with the male and female relatives who
were her contemporaries.

My Generation
As stated earlier, appwóro was something taught and encouraged by my mother as
we grew up. However, my generation’s version of appwóro is not as strict or rigid
as the version practiced by my mother and women of her generation. The reason
for this is that many women of my generation have not found the more rigid and
traditional form of appwóro practical for our lives today.

When I asked one of my relatives whether she practiced appwóro, she responded
immediately with a hearty chuckle. After regaining her composure, she told me that,
on the contrary, she would deliberately go out of her way to avoid practicing appwóro
because she would not conform to behaviors of bending, kneeling and crawling just
to get past her brothers or other males who were entitled to be accorded such acts
of respeto. In fact, she said she specifically avoided practicing appwóro by steering
clear of the vicinities where she knew the men gathered.

In today’s modern world, many Refaluwasch women have entered the workforce in
greater numbers than before. The reason for this is not just a matter of choice. It is
a matter of necessity in most cases, as many families find it virtually impossible to
survive on a single income. Also, some women now hold key leadership positions
in government, as well as in the private sector. Speaking from personal experience,
I know that I, and others like me, found that practicing appwóro in its rigid form is
impractical in today’s diverse heterogeneous society.

For example, when I worked as an Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
Division of the Office of the Attorney General in the CNMI, my job as a prosecutor
necessitated that I stand up in the courtroom while addressing the jurors or the
court. A number of my male relatives work in law enforcement. Therefore, it was not
unusual for me to interact with male relatives while working on a particular case.
Some male relatives who are not in law enforcement have also appeared in court
when summoned for jury duty. Had I been practicing appwóro, I would have had
to ask all male relatives present in the courtroom who are my contemporaries to
stand and remain standing before I could stand to perform my job in the courtroom.
Culturally speaking, they would not have been allowed to sit down until I sat down.
Obviously, that would have been impractical, not to mention awkward.

This would have been true in other public settings as well. For instance, there
were numerous occasions when I was called upon to stand and speak publicly as
a member of the Legislature or during political events. I did not find it practical
to stand on a stage or at the podium and assume the appwóro posture, even if my
brothers were in the audience. Yet, according them and the members of the public,
respeto in the way that I addressed them through language was always expected.

Nevertheless, I acknowledge that other Refaluwasch women may choose a differ-
ent path. The Refaluwasch woman has the ultimate choice—regardless of where
she is doing her public speaking—to choose to either stand on stage like I did or
stand offstage at the same level as the audience if that is her preference. This is
also acceptable and keeps with Refaluwasch values of humility and never putting
oneself above others.

The Next Generation
I am certain that some parents do teach members of the next generation in their
families some important socially polite behaviors, but from my observations, the
strict mandates of appwóro are mostly ignored. Again, this is something that our
Refaluwasch society must examine and determine whether these rules are worth
preserving, and, if the answer is “yes,” then meaningful steps should be taken to bring
about the desired results. Otherwise, not teaching it is analogous to discarding it.

IX. Sharing Cups, Dishes and Utensils
Traditional Refaluwasch culture also has strict etiquette governing the sharing of
cups, dishes and utensils between brothers and sisters. It is considered a cultural
taboo for sisters to share cups, dishes, or utensils with their brothers. If a brother
visits a sister’s house, he is prohibited from using any cup except for the cup that has
been specifically designated as “his.” The brother is also restricted from using any sil-
verware or plate aside from those designated as “his.” If he uses a cup, dish or utensil
that is not specifically designated as “his,” his sister is forbidden from using that same
cup, dish or utensil. Regardless of whether it was an unintentional use by the brother,
the sister would still not be allowed to use the item(s) for a few days before such
item(s) is/are considered “cleansed.” Only then may his sister use the item(s) again.

My Parents’ Generation
My father did not observe this cultural practice. However, my mother most certainly
observed this cultural practice as applied to her brother, as well as her contempo-
rary male relatives. Such restrictions only governed the relationship between the
sister and her brother. No such restrictions applied to the children.

My Generation
With some exceptions, I would say that my generation made a complete departure
from our parents’ generation when it came to sharing utensils, cups and dishes.
This was a cultural practice that my siblings and I never followed. All of us drank
from the same cups, ate from the same dishes, and used the same utensils. For some
reason, my mother decided not to enforce this practice that she and women of her
generation practiced. Besides, disposable cups, dishes and flatware made this a
non-issue for most of us.

The Next Generation
As happened in my generation, the cultural restrictions prohibiting the sharing of
cups, dishes and utensils among male and female siblings also disappeared among
the next generation.

X. Using the Outhouse or Bathroom
In traditional Refaluwasch culture, sisters must navigate their way to the outhouse
without their brothers knowing or seeing them. Imagine the difficulty of pulling this

off successfully every time her brother happens to be near the outhouse. In such
cases, the sister must be resourceful in enlisting the help of others to distract her
brother and lure him away from the vicinity of the outhouse in order for her dash
toward it. However, no such restrictions apply to the men.

My Parents’ Generation
To my knowledge, my father never engaged in this practice. Of course, my mother,
the more traditional of the two, complied with such cultural practices as she was
raised to understand observing these customs is important. I do recall some instanc-
es when she was forced to enlist the help of other family members to redirect our
uncle away from the outhouse in order for her to use it without his knowledge. This
later ceased being an issue after we moved to a house with an indoor bathroom and
my uncle moved in with his other sister and her family.

My Generation
This is another area of my generation’s marked departure from the rigid cultural
mandates practiced by my mother and members of her generation. While we do
not go out of our way to advertise when Mother Nature calls, we certainly are not
required to hide it anymore or to enlist the help of others to distract our brothers as
we scurry off to “powder our noses” (to use a Western euphemism). Nevertheless,
common decency and respeto demand that discretion be exercised.

Perhaps the main reason for this departure from tradition is the current prevalence
of indoor toilets instead of outhouses. With few exceptions, most contemporary
Refaluwasch households have one or two indoor bathrooms. Therefore, everyone
takes turns using the bathroom. In large families, one never knows who is going to
answer when someone knocks on the bathroom door. Had my sisters and I practiced
the outhouse etiquette of my mother’s generation, this would have presented quite a
dilemma, perhaps forcing me or one of my sisters to disguise our voices while in the
bathroom to avoid giving ourselves away if a male sibling came knocking on the bath-
room door. Once again, I believe that practicality won out over cultural restrictions.

The Next Generation							
As with my generation, the taboos that existed in my parents’ generation with
regard to the use of the outhouse or bathroom facilities have disappeared in
the next generation.

XI. Socializing
In traditional Refaluwasch culture, women and men never intermingle when they
socialize. Men often gather in a group or groups outside the house and away from
where the women typically gather, which is usually inside the house. This is done
for the purpose of ensuring that respeto is always maintained during such social
gatherings. Hence, loose language, dirty jokes, etc. may be shared in a relaxed
manner without fear of offending the opposite sex or eroding respeto.

My Parents’ Generation
In my early years, growing up on the island of Pagan in the Northern Islands,
I observed that my father socialized both in an all-male setting as well as in a
mixed-gender setting. At that time, my father was the elected Congressman repre-
senting the people of the Northern Islands and was also the District Administrator’s
Representative (DistAd Rep). His position called for him to socialize within a wide
circle of people from the Northern Marianas, Guam, other islands of Micronesia,
Hawai‘i, and other US states, as well as other foreign countries, such as Japan and
Australia. My mother, on the other hand, was more comfortable socializing in an
environment segregated by gender. Nevertheless, she had to adjust her comfort level
and adapt to the wider social settings when called upon to host gatherings required
of my father’s position as a public official.

My Generation
Today, my family socializes in both gender-segregated and mixed-gender gatherings.
If there was a gathering that included other relatives, the men would segregate
themselves from the women as they typically do. As my youngest sister recalled,
one teaching from my mother regarding respeto while socializing in segregated
gatherings is that it would be inappropriate for my sister to join the men, even if
her husband were part of the group. In gatherings of immediate family members,
however, my family usually socializes in a mixed-gender setting. Our family loves
to gather and sing, so all of my siblings frequently sit together to socialize and
sing with our nieces and nephews. No matter what, we must always be mindful of

treating each other with dignity and respect, in manner as well as in speech. This is
absolutely non-negotiable.

The Next Generation
I would say that, depending on the situation and the setting, the intermixing or seg-
regation of the two genders of the next generation is similar to that of my generation.

XII. Entering the Brother’s or Sister’s Bedroom
In traditional Refaluwasch culture, it is generally taboo for a sister to enter her
brother’s bedroom, especially if he is married. However, some exceptions apply. For
example, the sister may enter the single brother’s bedroom if she were to retrieve
his dirty laundry or clean his room. Otherwise, the sister is expected to stay out of
the bedroom. Moreover, the sister is prohibited from sitting on or lying down on her
brother’s bed. Doing so would be disrespectful to her brother. In cases where the
brother is married, it would be his wife’s responsibility to retrieve something from the
bedroom instead of his sister’s. This would include the dirty laundry, as the wife takes
over the laundry duties for herself and her spouse.

Conversely, the brother is also culturally prohibited from entering his sister’s
bedroom. This is strictly taboo, although this taboo might be relaxed in certain emer-
gency situations, such as in the event of a fire or a medical emergency. Other than
according respeto, there is also the expectation that barring the brother’s entrance
into the sister’s bedroom acts as a preventive measure against the possibility of inap-
propriate incestuous behaviors. Hence, one must be vigilant against this at all times.
Generally speaking, this taboo also includes other male relatives.

My Parents’ Generation
This was less of an issue for my parents as we lived apart from their siblings.
However, much later, when we moved to Saipan after my father’s death, there came
a time when my uncle (my mother’s brother) came to live with us, but he lived in his
own small shack that was detached from our house. Hence, there was no need for
him to enter the main house unless he was invited in, much less enter my mother’s
bedroom. My mother certainly had no intentions of entering his little shack.

My Generation
In my immediate family, certain reasons provide the “justification” for entering a
brother’s bedroom, such as, if the only phone in the house is located in one brother’s
bedroom. Entering the bedroom to answer the phone is a must. Another “justifiable”
reason is entering the bedroom to use the desktop computer or printer. Another
reason would be to retrieve something. Beyond these reasons, the brother’s room is
still considered off-limits out of respect for him and as a preventive measure against
any inappropriate and unwanted incestuous incidents.

The Next Generation
With the next generation members in my immediate family, respeto is observed in
that siblings—males and females—are taught to respect the bedrooms of married
siblings. They are taught that they should not enter such domains unless consent
is expressly given. For instance, the bedroom occupied by one of my nephews and
his spouse is also shared with other family members who often stay over on the
weekends. Hence, the rules are more relaxed. Otherwise, on any normal weeknight,
respeto must be accorded to give the couple their privacy. Another exception where
entering the married couple’s bedroom is acceptable is when the parents of an
infant are both away at work while their baby is still asleep in the bedroom. In this
scenario, it is perfectly fine to enter the bedroom to care for the baby.

XIII. Attire
In traditional Refaluwasch culture, men wear a red loin cloth called a “ttughum-
agh.” Typically, no shirts are worn with the ttughumagh. The traditional women’s
outfit consists of a red wrap-around skirt with hem lines that extend either down
to the calves or the ankles. The skirt is called an “apelipel.” The women, especially
older women, also are topless. The skirt alone is considered an entire outfit.

Subsequent generations later ditched the ttughumaghs and the apelipels as every-
day wear. This is especially true for Refaluwasch who have moved to Saipan from
the Northern Islands and find themselves living with other diverse cultures and pop-
ulations who primarily wear modern Western-style clothes. Obviously, dressing in
traditional clothing while everyone else is dressed in Western-style clothing makes
one stand out and would not facilitate successful assimilation into the community.

It would be awkward for both the Refaluwasch woman or man to appear at work
topless in their traditional ttughumagh or an apelipel.

My Parents’ Generation
As a young child growing up in Agrigan, I recall seeing the elder men of my parents’
generation (and even older) wearing the ttughumagh as they went about their daily
lives. They were often topless. I also recall seeing the women on Agrigan, especially
the elder women, wearing the apelipel on a daily basis. They, too, went topless.

However, I never saw my father wearing a ttughumagh until decades later, when I
visited the American Memorial Park Museum in Saipan one day and came across a
series of black and white photographs taken on Agrigan immediately after WWII.
Two of the photographs that are included in the series show one of my aunts (my
mother’s first cousin, who was married to one of my father’s elder brothers) holding
a radio as she stood next to an American GI. In two of the photographs, there were
two teenage boys kneeling in front while looking back at my aunt and the GI. My
father was one of the boys in the photographs. He was 14 years old when the photo-
graphs were taken. Incidentally, one of the photographs taken that day with just my
aunt and the GI became part of the photo exhibits that hung on the wall for a time
at the American Memorial Park’s WWII Museum. I have never once seen my father
wearing a ttughumagh in person.

On the other hand, I did see my mother wearing the apelipel in Agrigan. I even
recall her telling us a story about when she wore an apelipel to church with one of
her cousins when they were teenagers. However, she only dressed in contemporary
Western dresses when we lived in Pagan and Saipan.

My Generation
One of the major differences in the manner of dressing between my parents’ genera-
tion and my generation is that the males no longer wear the ttughumagh and women
no longer wear the apelipel on a daily basis. The only time that these traditional out-
fits are worn is when either gender is part of a traditional dance group that performs
to entertain tourists or at some other special cultural events. Other occasions calling
for the wearing of the ttughumagh or apelipel would be during performances at
our yearly Cultural Heritage Month celebrations or as part of the entertainment at
annual events, such as the Flame Tree Arts Festival or Taste of the Marianas.

Other changes include some folks wearing the ttughumagh as if it were a wrap-
around skirt instead of as a loincloth style that exposes the buttocks. The women
still wear the traditional apelipel, although instead of the wrap-around style, some
find it more practical to have a seamstress sew the apelipel so that it is more fitted,
and any risk of it coming loose and falling off the hips is eliminated. Otherwise,
the horizontal-striped wrap-around apelipel also worn by previous generations
even older than my parents’ generation is the other preferred style also used today.
Another marked change is that the female dancers of today never go topless.

My eldest sister recalled the story of how my father had to convince my mother
to allow my sister to wear pants (As I write this, I marvel at how far we have truly
come). When my eldest sister was in high school in the early 1970s, my father had to
explain to my mother that my sister needed to climb some stairs to get to her classes
on the second floor of Marianas High School. Therefore, it was necessary for her to
wear pants to preserve her modesty and dignity.

As the second oldest of five girls, I consider myself fortunate that I did not have to
fight that battle, as my mother had been won over on the practicality of wearing
pants. However, she remained stubborn about hemlines. While she accepted the tra-
ditional mandates on where appropriate hemlines should be as she was growing up,
this was a topic that she was adamant about. She made sure that all of her daughters
knew her opinion on the matter. Her rule was that the hemline had to be below the
knee and shorts were off-limits, unless the pant legs were also cut below the knee.

My eldest sister bore the brunt of our mother’s rigid teachings on the subject of
hemlines. As my sister explained, it was the belief that any outfit worn with the hem-
line above the knee invited unwanted temptation from the opposite sex. Therefore,
due care must be taken to avoid putting oneself in such a vulnerable situation. The
main goal is to avoid putting the idea into the minds of those who may be tempted to
engage in inappropriate behaviors. As the saying goes—“Better to be safe than sorry.”

When my eldest sister asked for an explanation of the rationale behind this custom
of keeping hemlines below the knees, my mother’s reply was that this was strictly
necessary as a “deterrent”—a “preventive measure”—aimed at discouraging the
male eye from seeing the woman’s exposed knees and being tempted to engage in
lewd thoughts that might then lead to an unwanted sexual attack. However, given
that Refaluwasch women of my mother’s generation and previous generations often
exposed their breasts fully as they went about their daily chores without any fear
of triggering inappropriate sexual temptations, it strikes me as an odd contradic-
tion that a woman’s exposed knees would be considered more provocative than
her exposed breasts.

Today, I would say that the generational conflict about where the proper hemline
ought to be has diminished with the popularity of wearing long pants or long
Western-style skirts. However, the conflict continues regarding wearing “hot pants”
or “short-shorts.” This is still frowned upon within our immediate family, as well as
within Refaluwasch society as a whole.

The Next Generation
I have noticed that the rules have relaxed quite a bit with regard to how the next
generation dresses today. While dressing provocatively is still frowned upon, mem-
bers of the next generation have been able to get away with far more and treated
with way more leniency than previous generations, including my own. The hem-
lines are shorter now, resting above the knee and half-way up the thigh in some
instances. So, too, have the hemlines for short pants, which have become shorter
as well. There is even the sharing of clothing, such as t-shirts or socks, amongst the
two genders that appears to have gained casual acceptance. Broadly speaking, the
Refaluwasch community has become more tolerant and less traditional, mirroring
today’s more tolerant society.

One of the signs of the changing times in which we and the next generation now
live is the acceptance of transgender dress that would have raised eyebrows not
long ago. Today, some Refaluwasch boys now pierce one or both of their ears,
pluck their eyebrows, wear make-up, and paint their nails without raising concern.
But, to cultural purists or traditionalists, this behavior clashes with traditional
Refaluwasch culture wherein clothes are meant to conform closely to each respec-
tive gender’s masculine or feminine identity without any blurring of lines.

XIV. Body Parts
Traditional Refaluwasch culture teaches women that sisters accord their brothers
respeto by not touching anywhere on their brothers’ body from their upper torso
up to their hair. Unless a brother is sick and in need of being nursed back to health,
touching the brother’s upper torso, face or head is taboo. Another exception to this
taboo is when the brother is a young child in need of care, such as being bathed or
being nursed back to health.

One of the most important things for others to be aware of about Refaluwasch cul-
ture is that the face is very sacred to the Refaluwasch people. One must never touch
another person’s face—adults or children—and, if one must do so, then one must
preface such action by saying “Tirow.” While most people typically hear the word
“Tirow” used as a greeting (Hello), used in this context, however, the word means
“Excuse me” or “Pardon me.”

This Refaluwasch cultural belief that the face must never be touched clashes with
other cultures that believe it is perfectly okay to pinch a baby’s cheeks to convey
one’s affection or opinion of the baby’s cuteness, or even those who pinch an adult’s
cheeks in a playful manner. What one culture may deem to be an appropriate act
to convey affection is something that Refaluwasch people regard as rude. This is
especially true in cases where the pinches result in the baby’s screaming in pain.

My Parents’ Generation
In both his medical profession and role as a local healer, my father was accorded the
privilege of touching the face and other body parts in order to treat his patients. For
instance, I saw my father touch a patient’s face as he pulled an abscessed tooth. I was
also at the house when he delivered one of my sisters at our home in Pagan.

My mother’s only brother was the youngest child in her family. She helped to raise
and take care of him, but as he got older and could groom himself, my mother’s
help became unnecessary. I have no doubt that my mother would have initiated the

switch at the appropriate time to conform to the appropriate cultural etiquette of
respeto concerning touching the face and other body parts.

My Generation
Respecting our brothers’ faces and not touching their upper torso up to their hair
were things that my mother emphasized as we were growing up. This is a practice
that we still maintain today, although with a lot less rigidity, as we live in a society
where we (brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, etc.) hug and kiss each other on
the cheek. So, obviously, we do not subscribe to the rigid “no upper-body contact”
of our parents’ generation.

The Next Generation
While according respeto by not touching another person’s face is still encouraged
amongst the next generation, there is less emphasis on the rest of the restrictions
that had been observed in previous generations, including my own.

XV. Visiting Other People’s Homes
When visiting other people’s homes, regardless of whether it is a visit to a relative’s
house or not, Refaluwasch culture forbids entering the house without waiting to be
invited in first. Moreover, the visitor is also forbidden from going beyond a certain
point in the house. The visitor should accord proper respeto by remaining near the
entrance or, if the kitchen were right near the entrance, then refraining from wan-
dering beyond the kitchen area.

Another important cultural mandate is that visitors are absolutely forbidden from
entering the bedroom, which is considered the most private and intimate part
of the house. Additionally, another respeto etiquette that is part of Refaluwasch
culture is that visitors are expected to behave respectfully at all times and re-
frain from being nosy.

My Parents’ Generation
My observation of how my parents behaved while visiting other people’s
homes is wholly consistent with the cultural mandates expected of good and
polite house guests.

My Generation
One of my relatives who was raised by his paternal grandmother recounted that
whenever he and his grandmother arrived at someone’s home, he would knock
on the door politely and they would wait to be invited into the house. He said that
upon entering, the first thing that his grandmother would do was glance surrep-
titiously around the top four corners of the room near the ceiling to quickly and
discreetly scan the room for any protective local medicines that might be harmful
to her or him. A discovery of medicines—with potentially harmful spirits there to
protect only the members of that particular household—often resulted in a quick
termination of the visit.

Upon visiting other people’s homes, my mother repeatedly expressed that we were
to remain either near the entrance or in the kitchen for the entire duration of the
visit. We were also taught that we should be polite and not go to people’s homes on
an empty stomach or to be greedy if food was offered. Another thing my mother was
adamant about was that under no circumstances were we to ever take anything that
did not belong to us or to think about coveting anything that did not belong to us.
Such transgressions would have been met with either a severe verbal tongue lashing
or, in some instances, a “good” spanking. One must never shame the family.

The Next Generation
We, too, have taught and continue to encourage the next generation of our imme-
diate family to observe respeto behaviors when visiting other people’s homes. We
often remind them to stay within the established boundaries. Obviously, it is our
wish and desire that our children remember the lessons even when we are not with
them as they visit other people’s homes.

XVI. Visitors to Our Home
Visitors to a Refaluwasch home can expect to be welcomed hospitably. It is custom-
ary to offer food and beverages to visitors.

My Parents’ Generation
Growing up in Kagman, Saipan in the mid-1960s, I recall that our isolation from the
rest of the population was periodically broken when we had visitors on weekends.
Few people owned cars at the time and the travel distance encouraged relatives to

stay the weekend when they visited. My parents were gracious hosts who ensured
that our guests had a pleasant stay with us.

When we moved to Pagan after my father’s election to Congress and his appointment
as the District Administrator’s Representative for the Northern Islands, I observed
the way my parents went out of their way to be gracious hosts to our visitors. Days
before the off-island visitors would arrive, my father would go hunting with my rel-
atives for coconut crabs and other delicacies, which my mother would cook up and
serve our guests. My father would also go fishing with relatives so that our visitors
could also eat fish. Because we had a farm, visitors never left without a cargo of wa-
termelons, mangoes and oranges, as well as coconut crabs, fish and other delicacies
that were harvested from our island and waters. As to our local on-island visitors,
they, too, were often welcomed to the house with coffee, other beverages and food.

My Generation
When I was growing up, my mother kept us on a very short leash. This was espe-
cially true after we moved to Saipan following my father’s death. We were restricted
from going to the neighbors’ houses to play. Our yard was the extent of our bound-
ary. Hence, we hosted childhood friends at our home rather than us visiting them at
their homes. Whenever childhood friends came over to our house to play, my mother
would insist that we offer them food and beverages the minute they appeared at our
house. To my mother’s way of thinking, offering our visitors food and drinks is a
good host’s first obligation in keeping with respeto practices. However, inviting our
friends beyond the confines of the kitchen or main common areas was still taboo.
Under no circumstances were we to ever invite our friends into the bedroom area,
and this is another practice that we maintain to this day.

The Next Generation
Despite our teachings, I cannot say that the members of the next generation in our
family have always adhered to our cultural teachings in this area. Sometimes, they
invited their friends beyond the points where visitors are normally allowed access.
It is only a problem when we learn about this breach after the fact. Some members
of the next generation choose to ignore this mandate or are completely oblivious to
the teachings that my mother was very strict about.

XVII. Conclusion
The 2010 Census, which includes the census figures for the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, reported that the total population of Refaluwasch
(Carolinians) was 2,461, as compared to the total population of 12,902 Chamorros.
Historically, the Refaluwasch population has always been small, and it has remained
this way today. Given that we have been in the Marianas since the 1800s, the very
small size of our Refaluwasch population is an enigma. I maintain that there contin-
ues to be a threat that we will either perish as a people if our population dwindles
every generation, or that we perish because we have allowed our unique cultural
identities to die out. So, what can we do about this?

I maintain that culture is not static; it is organic—a “living thing”—that evolves
constantly and is shaped by societal and environmental influences of the time.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to identify those important core values of our
Refaluwasch culture worth preserving and take decisive actions to teach and per-
petuate them while allowing our culture to evolve with the times. In other words, we
must adapt in order to survive.

I asked members of the next generation to share what lessons of respeto they had
learned from their parents and relatives, and I received the following answers:
     • Behaving respectfully when visiting other people’s homes;
     • Listening and not talking back to their parents;
     • Doing their chores in a timely manner when asked;
     • Behaving in school;
     • Staying off drugs and alcohol;
     • Staying out of gangs;
     • Choosing the right friends; and
     • Attending church on a regular basis.
This is highly encouraging. What this tells me is that some parents are doing a fine
job of communicating with their children and imparting important cultural values
to them. And the good thing about this is that it shows the children are listening.

Though no child is expected to absorb all of the teachings imparted to them, I nev-
ertheless commend parents who take the time to actively engage their children in
lessons on our Refaluwasch cultural beliefs and teachings. And while this is all good

and positive, we must also remind ourselves that we should not rest on our laurels,
but remain vigilant in teaching and passing on important core cultural values. It
is imperative that we continue to reinforce our cultural beliefs and traditions to
the next generations.

I attribute some of the next generation’s lack of full compliance with our cultural
teachings to the fact that they are still young and still in training. Despite this under-
standing, it is quite difficult to assuage feelings of apprehension when a member of
the next generation in our family commits a cultural faux pas that reflects poorly on
the family. An example of this would be sitting down to eat in front of visitors with-
out inviting them to share the meal. In the absence of a polite invitation to partake
in the meal, the young “offender” ought to have just waited to eat after the visitors
had left. This is an example of such cringeworthy moments. However, such awkward
instances also provide us with opportune moments to reinforce the lessons of res-
peto with renewed vigor. Like one of the perennial favorite mottos often quoted in
high school student yearbooks says, “If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”

Respeto is critical in preserving the way that family members are supposed to inter-
act with one another. Applied outside of the family, it helps maintain harmonious
relationships within our own society, as well as during our interactions with other
societies. It is easier to teach and pass on what we still have than it is to reinvent what
we have lost. We ought to choose the path of least resistance. Like our language,
teaching respeto must begin at home. This is where it must start. Then, it ought to be
reinforced by our schools, churches and the community at large. Our government
must also be actively involved in this objective. All Refaluwasch have a stake in this;
everyone must get involved. We can do this together. As another popular saying
goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.”

Our history teaches us that we are survivors. We are alive today because our
Refaluwasch ancestors boldly set sail across open ocean in search of a new, safer
home here in the Marianas. If we can survive devastating earthquakes, floods and
typhoons, we can surely survive modernity, too! Let us continue to navigate through
life’s modernity without losing the Refaluwasch identity.

Lastly, allow me to take this moment to acknowledge and thank the following people
who made my contribution to this book possible. First, a huge danke and olomwaay
to NMC’s Ajani S. Burrell for his guidance, support and sheer persistence in re-
cruiting me to participate in this book project, thereby ensuring that a Refaluwasch
(Carolinian) voice is also heard; to Dr. Kimberly Bunts-Anderson, also of NMC, for
her helpful edits and guidance; to Dr. Don Rubinstein at the University of Guam
for his immensely helpful edits; to the CNMI Humanities Council for making these
types of valuable community projects possible; to my anonymous Refaluwasch in-
terviewees and consultants whose invaluable time, input and substantive reviews
made me strive even harder to produce a more inclusive and accurate contribution
to this book project; to Representative Sheila J. Babauta for her invaluable support;
and, last, but not least, I extend a huge olomwaay to Mrs. Margarita Olopai-Taitano,
my Refaluwasch Editor, not only for her substantive reviews and invaluable input,
but also for patiently and painstakingly correcting most of my horrible Refaluwasch
spellings. You all have my immense humble gratitude and respeto.

Misan Ánimasan Åsuli: field notes and conversations from the Talakhaya Watershed, Luta (Malcolm Johnson)


Topographic map of Talakhaya, missing streams and stories, produced by the United States Geological Survey, 1983

“The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.
It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of
grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.
It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow.
I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.
And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.”
                                            - Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali: Song Offerings

The åsuli (freshwater eels) live here, it is their home. Does my presence frighten
them? Do they know I am just passing through, scribbling notes of their existence in
the margins of a tattered map? Where will they go if the streams stop flowing year-
round and access between the ridges and sea vanishes? They have a long journey
ahead of them—we all do.

Sitting carefully on the jagged karst every week for the last few years has turned the
uncomfortable familiar, the karst and my discomfort worn smooth by our time to-
gether. In the freshwater pool, a ripple disrupts the fogged mirror-like water. Drops
trickling against polished stone echo among the surrounding cliffs, disrupted only
by the occasional call of one small silk-feathered såli, a native bird in Luta (Rota). I
sink the metal-encased end of a multiparameter water quality meter into the water.
Delicately calibrated to calculate aquatic chemistry, the instrument garners curi-
osity from the uhang (shrimp) with their little claws and delicate pereiopods. They
climb and crawl on the instrument without fear. Can they remember it from the
week before? Sinking to the muddy bottom, the machine works a neoteric kind of
wizardry to offer me information whose meaning remains confined to spreadsheets
or my limited baseline knowledge.

When I first arrived in Rota a few years back, I regularly ventured out of the office
to conduct fieldwork necessary for building both intimacy and awareness of the
Talakhaya coastalscape, the place where land, sea, and the more-than-human as-
semblage meet. Although researchers have been here for decades, there remains a
sense of mystery emanating from the limestone forests, as though no accumulation
of knowledge could ever quite encapsulate the spirit of the island. Unlike many
of my colleagues here, who are dedicated to the monitoring and recovery of the
endangered åga (Marianas crow) or fanihi (Marianas fruit bat), my commitments
revolve around the priority watershed on the south side of the island. Fires, clear-cut-
ting, sugar cane, more fires, erosion, another fire, and the seemingly endless pursuit
to stabilize the soils with non-native grasses and nursery-grown native tree species
have left the watershed in a perpetual state of recovery. These pursuits are not mine
alone, the burden of growth and loss shared across generations and between islands.

“Everything is part of a watershed.” This innocuous statement is radical in nature,
particularly given the fact that many of us know very little about the watershed we
inhabit, let alone watersheds in general. Watershed is loosely defined as the “line
separating waters flowing into different rivers,” where a shed represents the “ridge of
high ground between two valleys or lower ground, a divide” (Soanes & Stevenson,
2004, p. 1632). A quick search of catchment area maps or drainage divides or water
basins, which are watersheds of a different name, will produce images such as
Figure 1 of countries and communities redrawn with colorful, chaotic shapes that
rarely share similarities with the borders of states or countries that we are familiar
with. Hydro-cartographies could not care less about politics and nationalism.

The Talakhaya Watershed is one of five watersheds on Rota (Figure 2) and is locat-
ed in the south of the island, where there are no paved roads and few permanent
structures. Turning the corner at Poña Point, you can look up at the steep slopes that
define the watershed, deep green in the wet season and an eerie brown in the midst
of the dry season. A decade ago, the community came together with support from
government agencies to establish Talakhaya as a “priority watershed,” a term related
to NOAA’s Coral Reef Initiative, which allowed for a steady stream of funding to
recover and revegetate the exposed soils of the watershed in the hopes of reducing
erosion and conserving the adjacent coral reefs. The process led to the Conservation
Area designation, the publication of the Conservation Action Plan, and implemen-
tation of the annual revegetation project. However, success for the project, for a
return to the pristine limestone forests that once graced the southern coast, is de-
pendent on the commitments of community members to care for the slopes as they
would their own homes.

The Five Drainage Divides or Catchment Areas of Luta


Note. Each area is defined by a combination of geological, topological, and fluvial aspects. The Talakhaya water-
shed is of particular interest because it is the only place on the island where the water flows on the surface. From
The watersheds of Rota [Image], by CNMI Bureau of Environmental and Costal Quality (BECQ) – Division of

To know a watershed, from a data-driven natural-science perspective, demands
familiarity with a wide range of disciplines: geology to understand the way stones
and aquifers alter the hyporheic flows where the water moves beneath the surface;
hydrology to grasp the influence of sediments and nutrients on the quality of flow-
ing water and the resulting change in its chemistry; biology to sense the way fish
and shrimp and trees and birds all depend on the ecosystem that encompasses
them.; ecology to comprehend the depth of interconnectedness; and sociology to
discern the human bond with the coastalscape. Soil composition, historical land-
use changes, impacts on coral reefs, and the infrastructure that allows us to pass
through, study, grow, and depend on the watershed also have dedicated life-long
pursuits of knowledge.

The Talakhaya Watershed is overflowing with these knowledges, much of it hidden,
but enough sensually accessible for me as a researcher. Squatting on the edge of the
freshwater pool, I am struck by how much I do not know. What species of fish is that?
Why is the water suddenly so turbid? Has this shoreline erosion increased since the
first people wandered these same veins? Notebook in one hand, camera attached to
my backpack, dirt under my fingernails. There are divides everywhere, each stream
its own watershed. Stories are woven into the roots holding streambanks in place.
Watersheds turn into subwatersheds that turn into subsubwatersheds that turn
into innocuous pools of water that vanish when it is either too hot or too wet to
sustain their borders.

Leaning over the muddled waters with a small plastic bag to gather water samples, I
freeze as something flashes out of sight beneath the sunken leaves and stones. Was
that just an apparition, a trick caused by shifting light and waterlogged branches?
No, this anguillid has been carefully documented in my notes, defying its nocturnal
habits to make its presence known to the visitor that returns once again. Åsuli, more
commonly known as giant mottled eels or Anguilla marmorata, spend the majority of
their lives hidden in the muddy depths of freshwater pools, where they can sustain
themselves on a steady supply of uhang and avoid the impacts of oppressive dry
seasons. While it is often hard to discern the age of an åsuli just by looking at them,
they can live for decades in the slopes and streams of Talakhaya.

During my first trek into the jungle accompanied by a young taotao tåno’ (Indigenous
person, literally “people of the land”) trained to understand the equipment and sci-
entific procedures, I asked questions like “how many waterfalls are there?” or “what
unique species call these streams home?” He offered relatively few answers while
acknowledging a lack of expertise in such things, which he attributed to his age and
education. “Faisen i mañaina, ask the elders,” he advised. I soon came to learn that
the knowledge of this ecosystem had been lost over time, from the Spanish colo-
nization to the American standardized testing system. Only in the last decade has
local ecological knowledge been incorporated into the school curriculum, with only
a few species and habitats getting recognized. In many cases, it comes down to the
passion of an individual teacher to make sure åsuli or fanihi or åga are even men-
tioned in the classroom.

While my work partner stood on the streambank and I knelt in the stream with my
hands clasped around the multiparameter instrument, he shared his story about
getting to know the watershed more in the last year than he had in his whole life.
His position was bound to Talakhaya and the revegetation project, supported by the
local environmental agencies. Trained to raise plants in the nursery, collect stream
water samples, and monitor the revegetation efforts, he acknowledged how little his
friends knew about the way the streams change and shift throughout the year. There
are few, if any, lesson plans dedicated to the streams of Luta and even fewer oppor-
tunities for students to travel the relatively short distance to the southern side of the
island to gain familiarity with Talakhaya. And with climatic changes on the horizon,
there are some lessons that will only make their way into history books.

The dry season is in full swing as I trek along the stream towards higher ground.
During the months when the rains are sporadic and the soils are vulnerable, majestic
falls become mud pits tainted with the scent of rotting fish and occupied by raven-
ous hilitai, the mangrove monitor lizards, with their sharp claws and jagged teeth.
Babbling streams turn speechless, streambanks collapse under their own weight, the
scientific instruments (Figure 3) used to measure water quality lose their telos. While
the more serious impacts of climate change are still on the horizon, others have al-
ready made themselves known. Even during my geologically fleeting presence in the
watershed the last few years, change arrived drastically compared to the historical re-
cords describing the ecosystem. One landowner, whose surname is synonymous with
one of the island’s villages, called the changes unprecedented in the many decades
he had been there. Watching the rheic, the aboveground flow, creep meter by meter
further inland every week, I would leave the jungle full of sadness and confusion,
uncertain that my efforts to craft a management plan to protect this place for future
generations would matter. How will the åsuli find their way without flowing water, I
wondered. What will sustain the residents of Rota if the waters run dry?

During a stakeholder planning workshop held in the mayor’s office, the participants
grapple with similar questions. Standing around a plastic table draped in a printed
map of the entire conservation area of Talakhaya, including symbols for streams,
properties, and critical habitats for a few of the endangered and endemic species
of Talakhaya, debate ensues over the biggest threats to watershed health: invasive
ungulates, intentionally set fires, erosion of the badlands, climate change, politics.
Sticky notes scribbled with these very words are placed in their rightful locations
and concern mounts as the map vanishes beneath the yellow and pink pieces of
paper. In a room full of community members who have the greatest familiarity with
the watershed, we all feel humbled by the sheer challenge of managing the coast-
alscape, particularly given the diminishing resources available. Just like the streams
drying up, so too are our chances to reverse course and establish a resilient future for
the watershed and its human and non-human inhabitants.
In my attempt to more accurately map the freshwater veins of the watershed,
upon whose source every human resident of the island depends, I stick as close

to the stream edge as I can. While it is fairly common knowledge that 90% of the
island’s drinking water comes from Talakhaya, it became abundantly clear at the
stakeholder workshops that accurate and micro-level maps of the various features
of the watershed are non-existent and are needed. From missing streams to vague
allusions to the locations of invasive species, our current maps are not sufficient for
the goals. The streams are dangerously inaccessible to most people, the biologists
and the deer hunters notwithstanding. Eventually, the dense foliage completely
thwarts my progress, forcing me to fumble forward on my hands and knees until the
tropical limestone forest gives way to colossal grasses and treacherous ridgelines.
The familiar warmth and brilliance of the sun disorient me after hours protect-
ed beneath the canopy.

Pulling my tired legs up the steep incline, I approach a cluster of stones situated
higher than the jungle below. Sitting down and looking out across the rolling hills
with scattered emerald patches left intact after decades of habitat destruction, I
wonder what this land looked like before all the clear-cutting. Massive scrapes of ex-
posed rock remain where the depleted topsoil has vanished, leaving behind barren
uninhabitable earth, glaring scars when seen from above. From my pocket, I unfold
a map and begin to trace my finger along the dark green veins, canopied sanctuaries
for freshwater pumping fertility into the region, and the barren patches of brown
denoting the dried-out savannah.

The neighboring ridges obscure the decades of monumental effort taken to secure
the exposed soils and eventually return the landscape to limestone forest. Hundreds
of thousands of non-native grasses specifically chosen for their ability to hold soils
and prevent erosion have been transplanted from nurseries on the other side of the
island. A group of nursery assistants are hired every year to propagate the seeds of
Bahiagrass and Vetiver in addition to as many endemic trees as the germination of
seeds can provide. A few months later, a dozen volunteers drive up the treacherous
trails and carry the seedlings over ridges and through valleys to reach the next area
requiring revegetation. Their hands are saving the watershed, their efforts are giving
the åsuli and all the native species a fighting chance in the face of climate change.

The revegetation efforts are situated on ground once ravished by human invaders,
occupiers of these islands, who clear-cut large swaths of the native jungle that once
existed on the ridges between each valley. It is hard to say when the landscape level
changes really started, but the small monuments demarcating the existence of an old
Japanese sugarcane company may signal the last major alteration. The revegetation
project is transitioning towards planting more trees next year, with the stated goal
of returning the area to its past existence, a lush forest that may only ever exist in
stories. We debate feasibility and fundability and capability in a small office, while
the whole future of the watershed is clouded in uncertainty. Our efforts sometimes
feel like an Anguillidian ouroboros, an eel eating its own tail.

Most years, they are able to bring a group of students up to the area to assist in the
project. Under the glare of the sun, without any nearby canopy, the young volun-
teers get dirt under their nails as they place the grasses into divots dug out by an
experienced Luta Livelihoods volunteer. After only a few hours, they are exhausted,
sweat falling from their arms and chins. One young woman sitting nearby taking a
needed break mentions to me how she had no idea people were planting trees in
Talakhaya to prevent erosion from destroying the adjacent reefs. “Is this all that we
can do?” she questions. The following day, the same students gather on a beach to
don snorkels and explore one of the nearby reefs, after a brief lecture about what we
as individuals can do to help protect corals. Maybe there is still hope.

On my last workday in Rota, I sat on exposed karst stones with James Manglona,
Rota’s Forester for CNMI Forestry (Figure 4). The sun was irradiating us, grass whis-
pered with the occasional breeze, volunteers chatted while they worked nearby.
The sweat puddled on our brows, and I expressed concern that I had accomplished
so little, that what I had learned over the last few years painted a grim scene for
the Talakhaya watershed. James, the coastalscape’s greatest champion, reassured
me that every person who has dedicated time to protecting the watershed matters,
particularly when change is already present. Without him, there would be no resto-
ration, no soil-securing grasses, no hope for the myriad of non-humans that grace
the lands and seas around us. “Will you come back?” It sounded more like an invi-
tation than a question. We both recognize the persistent difficulty of conservation
when capacity continues to recede like streams in the dry season. With his support
and the commitments of the stakeholders, a plan is in place that should ensure
funds for the foreseeable future. The silence between us faded as we got back to the

work at hand, continuing along the perimeter of the annual revegetation project to
more accurately map that year’s success.

Note. From Malcolm Johnson, 2019

The sound of approaching rainfall forces me from my perch on the exposed stones
as I quickly tuck away the map. The rain carries both life and destruction for this col-
lection of Strahler-numbered watersheds (the Strahler-number is a mathematical
approach to identify and label the branching network of tributaries within streams,
rivers, or watersheds). As the droplets seep into the arid soils, the flora exalts for
sustenance in the midst of the dry season. At the same time, along the edges of the
delicately carved streams, the weight of the moisture begins to rip trees and shrubs
and stones from their once-stable banks. As the rainwater rushes down from the
mountain it fills with sediment, altering the mapped streamlines and eventually suf-
focating the increasingly vulnerable corals that seem worlds away. Lasting for only a
brief moment, the clouds disappear over a few ridges in the distance, leaving behind
the comforting scent of petrichor and a drenched desire to reverse course, head back
down into the veins below, and return to the parked truck.

Carefully navigating downstream, the scent of moss and decomposing leaves and
water teeming with a microbial universe refreshes and soothes me. Suddenly, I
glimpse the marbled form of an åsuli caught in a pool no larger than itself, cut off
from the flowing waters that just rushed through this sheltered valley. Crouching
down no more than an arm’s length away, I cause the anguillid to recoil in its limit-
ed space, trapped and separated. A familiar predicament for this isolated scientist.
Eating freshwater eels was historically undertaken by the lower mañåchang caste
of the archipelago, allowed only if caught by hand since they were forbidden from
using fishing tools and spears (Cunningham, 1992). Stories told by the inhabitants of
another island lament the harvesting of the reclusive creatures, sold to markets in
distant places that had already exhausted their local eel populations (Pacific Worlds,
n.d.). Some believe that the Anguilla marmorata (Figure 5) dig deep holes to open up
the underground artesian wells, leukocytes ensuring the caves continue to supply
blood to this ecosystem.

Figure 5
Juvenile Åsuli Found in One of Talakhaya’s Streams


Note. From Malcolm Johnson, 2018.

The small black eyes meet my own and stillness overtakes us both. I wonder if it
would be best to continue onward, taking a wide arc away from the confused giant
mottled eel and allowing fate to take its course. Fleetingly, I contemplate reaching in
and grasping my companion, if I could be so bold to find solidarity with such a mag-
nificent being, in order to assist in relocation to a more abundant body of freshwater.
Or would my attempt just result in distress for the åsuli and the stream, which have
found a delicate balance without my intrusion? Just when I have decided on how

to respond, a flicker of brown and yellow dances between my legs, shimmies across
polished stones, and vanishes over a ledge in the distance that conceals a shallow
pool inhabited by uhang. The dry season will come to an end soon and access to
food and the sea will be in reach.

Continuing towards the forest’s exit, the murmur of the stream fades and all that is
left is the scraping of stones beneath my boots and the occasional joyful cry from
the fluttering såli (starling) that seems to have followed me throughout the day’s
journey. Signs of the hyporheic zone—the spongy sub-streambed— manifest in
the sinking of footprints into the muddy streambed and the stoic cane toads wal-
lowing in moistened crevices, a species native to the Americas, introduced to this
liminal space in order to control pernicious beetles from decimating the fields of
sugar cane. Hitchhiking across oceans with their human counterparts, the highly
toxic toads have colonized islands all over the world, outcompeting the indigenous
amphibians, filling puddles with countless eggs, consuming anything that will fit
in their massive mouths, including the juvenile åsuli. There is no plan to curb their
population here, just to accept their existence and pray that they do not cause any
more ecological damage.

Managing, protecting, and conserving watersheds is a monumental task. It can take
dozens of people, multiple meetings, and hundreds of hours researching, writing,
and monitoring just to reach some kind of consensus on what needs to be done to
ensure resilience for a single species, let alone an entire coastalscape. Yet the in-
terconnectedness of all the flora, fauna, waters, soils, infrastructure, histories, and
humans that move in and out of the basin makes every response to the identified
threats subject to conflict and uncertainty. We need to repair the road to reach the
water cave, but what about the endangered damselfly? No hunting is allowed in the
conservation area, yet the deer keep eating all the endemic trees that are out-plant-
ed. In passing, someone mentions climate change at a stakeholder meeting, and
everyone shifts uneasily in their seats. The streams ran dry again this year and the
corpses of åsuli were found in one of the deepest dried-out pools.

Competing cultures reign supreme in stakeholder meetings in Rota, with one con-
stituency arguing for the need to protect wildlife so that it can be harvested as the
ancestors had done, while another sees the “undeveloped” areas of Talakhaya as an
opportunity for a new hotel, without mentioning the two abandoned hotels passed
on the way to the meeting. Someone in the room will distrust the government for
letting the habitat destruction continue in one area or for neglecting to repair a road
in desperate need of stabilization. Another person sits silently and only leans in
to remind everyone of the importance of a particular cultural site or an endemic
species habitat. There are arguments over the use of pesticides, debates over who
is the responsible entity, and disagreements over the lack of enforcement. Even the
most knowledgeable residents struggle to agree on what is best for everyone and
everything in Talakhaya.

As I duck beneath the cement footbridge, the rolling sound of waves in the distance
begins to echo through the depths of the dynamic world hidden beneath the dark
green veins of the map. Hearing the latching of a car door, I peak over the rocky
bank and decide to climb out and introduce myself to the couple loading bunches
of bananas and pugua (betelnut) into the back of their corroded pickup truck. They
tell me about harvesting dozens of different species, catching freshwater prawns,
and utilizing the land for decades based on knowledge passed down from their par-
ents. I tell them about my research on the streams, and the goal of establishing a
management plan for the watershed. The man reminisces: “When I was younger,
I counted all the waterfalls for a class project with the help of my father.” He had
forgotten the exact number by now, guessing, “Fifty maybe?” This was one of the
recurring questions I asked friends and colleagues and community members: “How
many waterfalls do you think Rota has?”

Sitting in one of the restaurants in town on Sunday mornings early in my stay, I
would introduce myself to fellow diners and talk about my hopes for my next 3 years
in Rota. I would always inquire about their local knowledge of the watershed, usual-
ly starting with that simple waterfall question. I asked the same question to kids in
all the schools. The answer was always “one,” or maybe “five” if they assumed each
major stream had one. In the second year, I conducted a survey about the watershed
and the environmental resources of Rota in general. Still the same answers on the
number of waterfalls, which made sense given that the most frequent responses for
“time spent in the watershed” were “never” or “once a year.” If you define waterfalls
by a height taller than your average male, there are close to 70—some taller than 20
meters—and nearly all traversed by åsuli.

The couple and I speak about changes in the climate they have experienced in their
lifetime, like the once perennial streams now dry more days of the year than flowing,
and our fears for future climatic disturbances inevitably submerging the island’s
village beneath the tides. She asks me about the water cave, the source of the wet-
lands, which secures the precious waters for human usage. “What impacts are our
actions having on the streams?” she asks. Offering only predictions and hypothe-
ses, I encourage them to participate in the next stakeholder meeting to share their
thoughts with the rest of the community. Before continuing my descent, I question
them about their familiarity with the åsuli inhabiting the waters. He recalls how
his family would ensnare only the largest, taking no more than once per year from
the same green vein, yet they have become so rare he can no longer recall the last
time one was caught.

Conversations like this were rare when venturing out into the watershed, a place on
the island where I would most easily achieve solitude. On one occasion, I stumbled
upon two older gentlemen wearing wetsuits torn to shreds, floating in water only a
few feet deep and filling woven baskets with uhang. I asked them how often they
collect the freshwater prawns. “A few times a year, although it is much easier when
the streams run partially dry” was the response. On another occasion, I surprised
a couple newly arrived on the island eating their lunch next to the most popular
waterfall on the island. After reminding them to not leave behind trash, I asked how
often they came out here. “This is our first time,” they told me. I wondered if it would
be their only time. I questioned others I encountered. A non-local guide taking a
group of tourists wearing zoris and carrying umbrellas up the main trail. A Public
Works employee on his way to clear foliage hanging over the dirt road. My questions
always have the same intention, attempts at piecing together the story of the water-
shed through their stories and their relationships with Talakhaya.

When I am not wandering around the watershed, my questions seem to garner a sim-
ilar sentiment, whether I am sitting in one of the restaurants or waiting at the post
office or presenting at the school or conducting surveys. The watershed and the reveg-
etation project are held in high esteem by the people of Rota, regardless of familiarity.
After 10 years of volunteers spending their summers planting grasses and trees in the
badlands, most of the community is aware of the project and the value of the water-
shed. However, only a select few have a comprehensive understanding of what was, is,
and can be. While I am sitting alone for breakfast on a Sunday morning, a manåmko'
(an elder) waves me over and asks me how the revegetation is going. He used to work
for CNMI Forestry and was impressed with how much the landscape has changed
since the inception of the project. “What comes next for Talakhaya?” he wondered.
A transition to planting only native trees, renovations to the roads in order to reduce
sedimentation, or nothing much at all. The future is still very uncertain. Who will
champion the watershed’s future? Who can?

Passing a few more cane toads, who frantically hop whichever direction they are
facing, a large shadow swoops across my path. I catch a glimpse of the blackened
wingspan of the endemic åga who laughs and teases me from the sparse canopy
while I stumble through the jungle. Recording the location in a small waterproof
notebook, to be passed on later to the endangered crow researchers also dedicated
to the maps and blemishes of this island, I step out into the looming sunlight once
again. Trust from the community does not come easy for scientists from the main-
land—trust eroded by fights over land and over the protection of endangered species.
Sometimes seen as another symptom of the federal government’s possession of the
islands, we must be careful not to take ownership over our findings—information
does not exist in isolation.

As I try to piece together the history of the watershed, it became increasingly evident
that the knowledge of the landscape existed in the silos of academia, was forgotten over
time, or never even reached the community. Scouring dusty documents written in the
late 1980s, I would find information that no one on the island seemed to remember,
maybe because it was never shared beyond the academic publication. The biologists
did not connect with the sociologists who neglected the geologists who could not care
less about the farmers tilling their land. As the management plan came together, we
tried to weave a tapestry out of peer-reviewed papers, the conversations with residents,
and åkgak (pandanus leaves). Even if a plan cannot provide lasting protection for an
ecosystem, it can serve as a repository for all the stories, facts, figures, maps, and hopes
for Talakhaya. Maybe in a few years, drawn by the tides, someone will pick up the
plan and feel inspired to let the streams flow through their veins, to find joy in the
non-native grasses, and to dance for the health of the watershed.

With the sea breeze pushing against me and the limestone forest to my back, I scan the
exposed coral reefs being hammered by waves. How do the fragile åsuli navigate these
tumultuous waters? Hatching from eggs in an unknown location in the middle of the
ocean west of the archipelago, the larval leptocephali drift with the currents until they
reach islands throughout the Pacific Ocean. Through some kind of magic, they dis-
cover this small watershed in the vastness, morph into elvers so they can swim up one
of the five streams and their towering waterfalls, and live demersally for two to four
decades in freshwater pools as yellow eels. Eventually, their mucus-covered bodies un-
dergo one last metamorphosis that signals their need to swim out to sea. Transforming
into silver eels, they return to the same bearings in the middle of the sea to spawn and
perish, their corpses serving as nutrients for their offspring, an ocean cradle of birth
and of death (Schofield & Fuller, 2021).

Returning to my beat-up red truck that survived an onslaught of falling breadfruit
from the neighboring tree, I think about the familiar journey of the åsuli. We both
found this island by chance, becoming our home the moment we felt the freshwater
flowing upon our faces, both destined one day to leave towards the sea. My muddied
fingers trace the dark greens of the map once more, remembering each tempestuous
encounter solely by touch. What if the åsuli cannot reach the ocean due to the changing
climate? When the elders sink to the bottom of the pools and are consumed by micro-
bial decomposers, who will feel the impacts of the last scaled spirit vanishing from
the ecosystem? When all that remains of the anguillidae are points scribbled on maps
and stories shared in classrooms full of distracted children, how will my intrusion on
the banks and cliffs be measured? I am just another impact of the Anthropocene, one
more visitor carving lines and points out of the living landscape. Watershed manage-
ment plans cannot restore the connection between humans and the giant mottled eel,
severed with each successive ruinous colonization, be it human or non-native species.

Managing a watershed or an ecosystem or even a single species seems near impossible
from this vantage point. Charting stakeholder relationships generates a complex web
of interconnected yet competing interests not unlike the multifaceted food webs grac-
ing science textbooks. Strategic actions can only answer questions that we know, yet
the complex coastalscape demands more. Like the åsuli, with their lives spread across
massive spatiotemporal scales, management plans must grasp at the extant knowl-
edge, informed by the past, with eyes towards the future. Climate change expectations,
casino projects covered in gold leaf, the collapse of fisheries, clashes over freshwater
resources. The stories from Talakhaya have changed every decade and will continue
to transform. A 10-year-old stands before Okgok Falls for the first time, smiling as her
elementary school teacher excitedly snaps pictures of Gua'a, the largest waterfall on
the island. A lifelong landowner sits attentively during a workshop about funding for
watershed-friendly land use changes. A local biologist presents her findings in the
mayor’s office to a small group of interested community members. Thousands of
human lives, to say nothing of untold other species, all connected to the watershed
and its uncertain future.

The truck and I bounce along the pothole-ravaged road constructed from the crushed
remains of deceased coral colonies. Approaching the aircon-chilled office sheltering
all the daily threnody for the åsuli, sights of the horizon prompts thoughts of future
watershed acquaintances. On some islands the eels are invasive, on others they are
endangered. What would I whisper in those vascular jungles to ask for permission
and forgiveness for my incursions? These streams are the veins that flow through my
hands, finding comfort in the well-known axilla of this limestone temple. The patterns
are versant, the flow prosaic. Yet the attempts to gather knowledge mar the landscape,
another outsider bearing the gift of colonization in the guise of conservation, arriving
and leaving like many of the other researchers who temporarily call this place home.
It only takes a few months for the eels to float to their freshwater sanctuary, satisfied to
remain until their final gambol beyond the lagoon.

Hågu, Guåhu, yan Hita (You, Me, and We): What Does it Mean to be Part of Guåhan’s (Guam’s) Multi-faceted Community? (Kelly G. Marsh-Taitano)

I Tinituhon (In the Beginning): Homelands
Some 3,500 or more years ago, i Manaotaomo'na (the People of Before; Chamorro
or CHamoru ancestors) voyaged to and made their home in what we today call the
Mariana Islands (Historic Resources Division, 2006, p. 7). I Manaotaomo'na had
their own way of referring to their home islands—Låguas for the southern islands
or perhaps the entire archipelago (meaning long and slender), and Gåni for the
group of islands north of Sa'ipan (Chamisso, 1817, as cited in Barratt, 1984, p. 28; L.
Cunningham, personal communication, March 14, 2017; Russell, 1998). Following
Indigenous protocols, i Manaotaomo'na fished and voyaged throughout the 550-mile
length of the archipelago, from the northernmost island of Uråkas to the southern-
most, Guåhan, or Guam (Figure 1) (Coomans, 1997; Furey, 2006, p. 44; Russell, 1998).
They gathered and cultivated åmot (traditional medicines) and foods like dokdok
(native seeded breadfruit), lemmai (seedless breadfruit), and suni (taro) in coastal
plains and interior portions of the islands. They also hunted various paluma siha
(birds) and other delicacies such as fanihi (fruit bat) and harvested other valued

resources like åkgak (pandanus) for weaving, fotfot siha (trees) to carve into canoes,
and ålutong (volcanic rock) to utilize as stone tools.

Figure 1
The Sakman (Chamorro Ocean-going Canoe) SAINA


Note. The SAINA, seen sailing here between Guåhan and Luta (Rota), was the first sakman crafted in Låguas yan
Gåni in over 250 years owing to the intensive missionization and colonization of CHamorus (Chamorros; the
Chamorro people) from 1698 on. Those foreign impositions greatly transformed aspects of traditional culture
and at times, specifically banned oceangoing voyaging (Cepeda et al., n.d.; Cunningham, personal communica-
tion, March 14, 2017). From Ron Castro, personal communication, March 14, 2017. Copyright 2017 by Ron Castro
and TÅSI (Traditions About Seafaring Islands).

Låguas yan Gåni are where i Manaotaomo'na became uniquely Taotao Tåno' (People
of the Land), or CHamoru (Chamorros; the Chamorro people) as is described in
the traditional oral narrative Fo'na and Pontan (B. Cruz, personal communication,
2016; Hattori, 2021; G. E. Taitano, n.d.b). Låguas yan Gåni are thus a homeland for
i Manaotaomo'na and their descendants. Former Governor of Guåhan Ricardo J.
Bordallo expressed the depth of the CHamoru sentiment for their homeland, which
can be applied to Låguas and Gåni more broadly, when he said,
     Guam is not just a piece of real estate to be exploited for its money-making po-
     tential. Above all else, Guam is the homeland of the Chamorro people. That is
     a fundamental, undeniable truth. We are profoundly “taotao [tåno']”—people
     of the land. This land … belongs to us just as surely, just as inseparably, as we
     belong to it. No tragedy of history or declaration of conquest, no legalistic dou-
     ble-talk can change that fact. (Phillips, n.d.)
At some point in those ancestral times, i Manaotaomo'na developed trading rela-
tionships with others in the region including neighboring Refaluwasch (Carolinian
Islanders) who voyaged to Låguas yan Gåni seeking i Manaotaomo'na pottery, med-
icine, and more. After centuries of this relationship, in the early 1800s, Refaluwásch
voyaged to settle the islands to the north of Guåhan and are also thus formally
recognized as Indigenous to those islands (Figure 2) (Farrell, 2011, pp. 192–201).

of Oceania. Photo from Kelly G. Marsh-Taitano.

I Matulalaikan i Måtan Guåhan (The Changing Face of Guåhan)
I Manaotaomo'na thrived in their homelands, over time settling islands throughout
the archipelago as attested by the latte (stone foundational supports for structures),
lusong (stone mortars), stone paved areas, åcho' atupat (slingstones), haguet (fish-
hooks), and other heritage items that exist there still. Their sphere of contact with
others further expanded in 1521, when i Manaotaomo'na discovered a Spanish ex-
ploratory expedition in their waters. This encounter initiated semi-regular trade
with the Spanish, which then eventually led to missionization and colonization of
Låguas yan Gåni (1695-1899), despite nearly three decades of resistance by sizeable

numbers of i Manaotaomo'na (Atienza, 2013; García, 2004). Although significant
features of CHamoru culture, like ocean voyaging and traditional dance, were lost
or otherwise challenged and transformed in this and later colonial administrations,
i Manaotaomo'na and their descendants have consistently maintained key aspects
of their culture and customs, such as retaining the centrality of family in their lives
(Souder, 1992; Underwood, n.d.). Further, many of the impositions or desired outside
cultural features were CHamorucized to suit CHamoru sensibilities and preferences
rather than adopted wholesale (see, for example, Figure 3).

Preparing the CHamorucized Version of Tortillas (Titiyas)


Note. Preparation took place at the 9th Annual Gupot Fanha'aniyan Pulan Chamorro (Chamorro Lunar
Calendar Festival) held January 2017. Tortillas were introduced to the Mariana Islands during the Spanish co-
lonial administration from “New Spain” (Mexico). The Spanish at the time also had colonies in parts of the
Americas, including what is now referred to as Mexico. From Edward B. San Nicolas, personal communication,
2017, February 17. Copyright 2017 by Edward B. San Nicolas.


The lengthy Spanish administration of i Taotao Guåhan (Chamorros of Guam)
ended abruptly with the Spanish-American War of 1898. The United States seized
Guåhan while the northern islands were sold to Germany shortly thereafter (and
then subsequently taken over by Japan in World War I, and administered by the
United States following WWII). Over time, these two divisions of Låguas yan Gåni de-
veloped into the US unincorporated Territory of Guam and the US Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI or NMI), as they are known today (Farrell,
2011; Hattori, 2006). This political divvying up of a homeland and the peoples upon
it tore apart a society and the families within it, without the involvement of the very
CHamorus, Refaluwasch, and others present who were directly affected. At times,
these borders imposed by outside forces have been closed by administering powers,
thereby slowing or stopping completely the traditional flow and reciprocation
among families. Such circumstances have produced some distinctions over time
between the i Taotao Guåhan and those of the northern islands.

Perhaps indicative of pre-colonial population patterns and later colonial reinforce-
ment, Guåhan is the most heavily populated island within Låguas yan Gåni. The
2020 Census of Guam tallied 153,836 CHamorus, Refaluwásch, other Micronesians
and Pacific Islanders, and peoples from islands and continents near and far who call
Guåhan home (US Census Bureau, 2021). However, similar to other Pacific Islanders,
a majority of CHamorus (from both Guåhan and NMI) now reside outside their
homeland islands, with at least 63% living in the United States, a trend that appears
to be on the rise (Figures 4 & 5). CHamorus live in every state in the United States,
from California and Washington to Texas, New York, and Florida, with an unknown
number living within other US territories such as Puerto Rico and American Samoa
(Hixson et al., 2012). If it were possible to count the thousands of other CHamorus
living abroad outside the United States, the percentages would shift even further,
maybe markedly so. Many find this trend of Indigenous depopulation of their
homeland for both for Guåhan and NMI disturbing (F. Untalan, personal commu-
nication, March 17, 2017). Conversely, there are some CHamorus from the States or
elsewhere who intentionally return home to connect with the land, know their fam-
ilies, and learn the culture as it is practiced in the islands.

Figure 4
CHamoru Distribution in the United States (2000)

Note. In 2000, the majority of those who self-identified as CHamoru for the US Census were still living in their
home islands. Some of these figures may be misleading, however, owing to factors related to lack of self-iden-
tification or inadequacy in census race/ethnicity categories. “Other US” does not include the territories of
Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, or American Samoa as US Census agents were not able to verify whether any
CHamoru resided in those areas. Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding off of figures. Adapted

Figure 5
CHamoru Distribution in the United States (2010)


Note. Some of the rise in numbers of those who identify as CHamoru in US areas other than Guåhan and NMI
might be due to improved census race/ethnicity categories and increased self-identification as CHamoru since
2000. “Other US” does not include the territories of Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, or American Samoa as
contacted US Census agents were not able to verify whether any CHamoru resided in those areas. Percentages
may not add up to 100% due to rounding off of figures. Adapted from The Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific
Islander Population: 2010, by L. Hixson et al., 2012, 2010 Census Briefs (https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/
briefs/c2010br-12.pdf ).

While there have long been fluctuations in Guåhan’s population, major shifts have
taken place within the lifetimes of our elders that have radically reshaped and re-
structured many aspects of Guåhan’s socio-cultural and political landscape (Bettis,
1996, p. 112; Untalan, n.d.). Guåhan, a homeland in which CHamorus made up the
vast majority of the island’s population up to pre-WWII years (91% in 1940), is now
one where CHamorus are outnumbered due to sizeable influxes of new community
members, including those from the NMI (Table 1). Many facets of modern life in
Guåhan would be unrecognizable to those alive just a few generations ago.

Note. Percentages are rounded off. Different censuses may use varying standards and methodology. The 1970
Census was omitted as it only identified the population as “native” or “foreign born,” which did not allow for an
accurate counting of CHamorus versus other ethnic populations on island. Adapted from The Native Hawaiian
and Other Pacific Islander Population: 2010, by L. Hixson et al., 2012, 2010 Census Briefs (https://www.census.gov/

www.guampedia.com/chamorro-migration-to-the-u-s/). Copyright 2009–2019 by Guampedia, and Census of
Guam, 2020.

During our great-grandparents’ time, very few in the community did not identify
as CHamoru—speaking the language fluently as their first language, practicing
the CHamoru culture, and living a CHamoru pre-WWII lifestyle. However, early
influxes caused the status of the CHamoru population to plummet to that of being
a plurality by 1950, just a few years after WWII, a status that has remained true up
to 2010 (Figure 6 & Table 1) (Bettis, 1996, pp. 106-107). Many are waiting to see if the
2020 census tabulations will challenge this long-standing status. It has now long
been the combined non-CHamoru peoples that make up the majority of the island’s
population. Currently, the second largest group on island (26%) are those who have
emigrated from the Philippine Islands, mainly in the decades following WWII, a
marked change from comprising just 2.6% of Guahån’s 1940 population (Quan, n.d.).

Guåhan’s Festival of Pacific Arts 2016 Delegation


Note. The delegation was about 500 people strong. Recognizing the island’s history of colonialism, immigration,
and emigration, Guåhan decided that, in addition to Indigenous Pacific Islander CHamoru delegates, other
community members who practiced or performed CHamoru arts and culture would also qualify to serve as
delegates, regardless of their ethnicity or whether they resided off-island or not. From Monica Okada Guzman,
personal communication, 2017, February 22. Copyright 2016 12th Festival of Pacific Arts Guam 2016.


Some scholars, such as the Honorable (former Congressman) Dr. Robert A.
Underwood (1997) have stated that such trends of dramatic population growth and
change may not bode well for the survival of the CHamoru people. He further said,
“It may simply not be healthy for a society to change with such rapidity regardless
of the characteristics of the incoming migrants or the ostensible economic benefits
they bring” (p. 131).

CHamorus as a people are often described by others as “welcoming” and “hospita-
ble” toward newcomers and visitors (DCA, 2003, p. 63). And while we can point to
many ways in which other peoples and their cultural ways have added to the variety
of life and experiences in Guåhan over the centuries, and continue to contribute
to the island society and economy, we must also remember that non-CHamorus
create other types of impacts as well. Adding to the challenges of globalization,
modernization, and other forces, the rapid influx of others is straining Guåhan’s
natural and governmental resources as well as, to some degree, repressing the
practice and maintenance of i kostumbren CHamoru (the Chamorro culture)
(Underwood, 1997, p. 131).

Inagofli'e': CHamoru Caring for Each Other
Much in keeping with Pacific Island cultural ways, CHamorus will often open their
houses, arms, and families in looking after new community members and visitors.
This is often referred to as being “hospitable” or “generous,” but it really is so much
more than that. One will typically not be thirsty or go hungry if there is a CHamoru
nearby with drink or food in hand. At an event, a CHamoru host and their relatives
will periodically check in on guests, hand out more refreshments, offer to dispose
of guests’ used plates, and offer food to take home (Mendiola, n.d.a). The goal is for
the guest to be “comfortable and wanting for nothing” (DCA, 2003, p. 63). Not often
discussed, however, is that the rules of host-guest etiquette extend in both direc-
tions and involve a custom of reciprocity, a key CHamoru cultural value alongside
interdependence, and a sense of obligation (Souder, 1994, p. 194). Those brought up
within similar cultures know these rules inherently. Many others have learned these
unwritten rules along the way or are continuing to learn.

However, there are a growing number of community members coming from other
US areas and other countries who do not know about certain customs prevalent in
i kustombren CHamoru, including rules about not being able to easily say “no” in
Island cultures so one has to develop a sense of not asking for more than is appro-
priate to receive; rules about deferring the first and second offers of a gift or offer of
food, as a means of gauging whether accepting that which is being offered would
unnecessarily burden the host; rules that relationships are, at their best, reciprocal
and generational; and other such Islander codes of conduct (Hezel, 2001; Hezel, 2013;
Mendiola, n.d.a). While CHamoru younger generations continue such protocols to
a degree, at least some of the CHamoru manåmko' (elders) and others express the
view that they see some of the finer details or intentions of customary protocol as
they knew it to be eroding, such as when it is proper to balutan (term informally
used to describe packing up food to carry out after an event) and who should be pri-
oritized in benefiting from balutan (e.g., Paulino et al., 2010). Mindful of this, cultural
leaders are working to ensure transmission of these finer elements.

CHamoru Culture and Our Multi-Faceted Island Community
A variety of cultural features from elsewhere have been, in whole or in part, woven
into the tapestry of island life, many of which have been CHamorucized. For in-
stance, a look at our island fiesta tables shows a sampling of the many peoples and

cultures that have come to the island (see Figure 3) (Mendiola, n.d.b). Added to
traditional CHamoru fare like fish, taro, breadfruit, and katupat (rice cooked in a
small basket of woven coconut leaves), have been CHamorucized dishes like titiyas,
tamåles, and red rice, as well as the introduction of pancit, lumpia, Kentucky Fried
Chicken, sushi, kimchi, and much more.

New names and new family members have made their way into CHamoru clans
(Forbes, n.d.). The CHamoru language has, as living languages do, adopted
and adapted from other languages that were imposed or otherwise introduced
(Underwood, n.d., p. 10). Holidays from elsewhere have replaced or been added to
traditional ones that are still celebrated or are in the process of being reinstituted
(such as ancestral processions of commemoration). And a broad range of new events
and activities have been added to the continuation of core values, such as respecting
elders, and the maintenance, perpetuation, or revitalization of traditional practices
and lifeways (Figure 7) (Souder, 1992; Underwood, n.d.).

revitalized CHamoru dance, chant, and other traditions after centuries of suppression of aspects of CHamoru
culture by colonial and other agents. The multi-storied hotels and developed residential neighborhoods in the

These cultural exchanges go both ways. For newcomers and visitors, it may be their
first chance to try local and localized foods such as kelaguen månnok (chicken mixed
with lemon, onion, and pepper); fina'denne' (local hot sauce); empanadas; and
pickled papaya, daigo (radish), mangoes, eggs, and even pickles (Figure 8). Living
in Guåhan may be their first foray out of the US mainland or their first venture
from another country or a neighboring island to become, essentially, immigrants or
settlers to an Indigenous homeland, (e.g., Bettis, 1996; Underwood, 1997).

For some, island life evokes a slower-paced style of living in comparison to the city
they left behind, while for others, Guåhan is the big city compared to the smaller
island or other community they moved from. What has become Guåhan’s multi-eth-
nic, multi-cultural community may be familiar to some newcomers in its being a very
cosmopolitan mix of people, while for others it may be a new experience in diversity
and their first time to live as part of a minority, which may take some getting used to.

On the other hand, numerous non-CHamoru members of Guåhan’s community have
called the island their home for decades. Quite a few have raised children in Guåhan
and perhaps even have grandchildren or great-grandchildren here, or, having been
born in Guåhan or having arrived as a child, know no other “home.” Some of these

long-time community members now refer to themselves as Guamanian (a term with
a complex history, as for decades, i Taotao Guåhan were referred to as such), or are
at times referred to as Che'lu (sibling), Chamaoli (Chamorro + haoli, an adopted
Hawaiian term for outsider, or foreigner), or other such terms meant to show their
long-term connection with the community (G.E. Taitano, n.d.a; Borja, 2017).

Long-term residents, though perhaps identifying as an American, Australian, Filipino,
Japanese, Thai, Pohnpeian, German, or another ethnicity on the one hand, may also
identify, on the other hand, as someone who grew up in a Pacific Island community,
or in Guåhan specifically, thus perhaps considering themselves a bit different than
their fellow ethnic or national “kin.” Many long-time community members marry
into the CHamoru culture or marry another long-term resident, at times creating
identifiable groups within the larger community. Though our community handles all
these changes—and new levels of diversity that have happened rapidly—relatively
well, there are tensions and serious issues such as a certain amount of division based
on ethnic lines as well as various challenges to the Indigenous CHamoru culture and
to Guåhan’s quest for decolonization (Bettis, 1996, p. 111).

Socio-cultural and Political Impacts
CHamorus, both in the Marianas and abroad, as any other people, have a wide
range of ways of looking at issues such as Guåhan’s social, cultural and political con-
ditions—each of which is a complex mix of inside and outside forces at work. Some
of the overarching concerns held by portions of the community over the years are
related to issues of dilution, domination, and diversion, each of which are discussed
briefly below (Table 2).

Dilution
There are several ways in which the concept of dilution impacts i Taotao Guåhan
both locally and within the nation. Impacts caused by those who have migrated to
the island since 1898 and 1940 are why the United Nations adopted particular resolu-
tions and plans of action for non-self-governing areas, such as “instructing member
states to prevent migration to colonial territories” precisely because it is understood
that their presence is in general “disruptive” and can be a “major obstacle” when
it comes to exercising the right to self-determination in a genuine way for the peo-
ples of that area to whom the right of self-determination belongs (J. Aguon, 2012;
Bettis, 1996, p. 112).

However, the United States has allowed migration to its territories to be largely
unregulated (outside of national immigration laws and regulations) and the large
influx of non-CHamorus who have become the majority of Guåhan’s community
have indeed muddied the understanding of many socio-cultural and political issues.
Guam’s history illustrates how “colonial powers have often used immigration to dis-
tract, confuse, and subvert the issues of decolonization, especially when they wish

to remain in control of the territory” with immigrants as “part of the colonizing
process” (Bettis, 1996, p. 111). Many i Taotao Guåhan have worried over the decades
about the dilution of their political control over their homeland, control that was
hard fought for and has only briefly been regained (1950-present) in a limited fash-
ion after over 300 years of colonial rule (Bettis, 1996, p. 111).

At the national level, the peoples of Guåhan are only allowed a diluted form of par-
ticipation in Congress (with a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives
and no presence in the Senate) and are not allowed to participate in the vote for
president. Instead, Congress has plenary (absolute) authority over US territories like
Guåhan, and has thus far provided only a limited set of rights and privileges to their
residents (Bevacqua, n.d.; C.P. Taitano, 1996).

CHamoru standing within the United States is further diluted as in many ways
they are treated as a minority, not only abroad, but in their own homeland. This
is largely due to the way that the US federal government and prevailing ideology
frame race, indigeneity, recognition of Indigenous lands, and notions of equality
(e.g., K.B. Aguon, 1993; Perez, 2002; Perez, 2003). Despite decades of local efforts
to have a real voice within a US government proclaimed to be based on the
democratic principles of equality and representation, CHamorus, among other
Indigenous Peoples in the United States, have been provided little consideration
and recognition (Waldman, 1985).

CHamorus, along with other Pacific Islanders, have been and continue to be, in
some ways, considered “non-White” in the United States. Parents, grandparents,
and great-grandparents within many CHamoru families served in the US military in
“Colored” troops, or were relegated to the same or similar limitations as “Coloreds”
by being able to serve only as mess attendants or personal aides to officers; were
denied service at establishments that did not serve “Coloreds” during the Jim Crow
years in the continental United States; and, at home in Guåhan, have had to contend
with, during much of the island’s history under the United States, segregated spaces
and facilities that have been, at their core, separate and unequal (e.g., Quitugua, 1991,
pp. 75–76; Sanchez, 1989, p. 145; Vance & Manning, 2015, p. 135).

Domination
Furthermore, the large influx of non-CHamorus who have arrived in the last 70 or
so years, came with or developed their own views about what is or what should be
CHamoru, Indigenous, or Islander ways, which may run alongside, dominate, or
overlap with the range of CHamoru views about these same issues. Some of these
newcomers are supportive of the maintenance of the CHamoru culture , while
others may still be trying to figure out what constitutes island life and I kustom-
bren i Taotao Guåhan (the culture of the CHamorus of Guam). Still others may
have their own notions of what being productive should look like (e.g., whether
Islanders use their time “productively” or not); which cultural “measuring stick”
should be used in assessing i Taotao Guåhan and their culture and language (e.g.,
whether they are truly CHamoru and to what degree); or what aspects of life
should be prioritized and when (e.g., the time and place for family and familial
obligations which are primary considerations in i kostumbren CHamoru), and so
forth (Aguon, 1993). Added to the presence of these notions is that some of the
island’s community members may be quite vocal about their precepts and domi-
nate the community conversation about where their notions should figure into the
consideration of local matters (Bettis, 1996, p. 106).

A lot of energy can thus be spent sorting through island issues to make sense of
them, or negating the disruption these competing notions cause. Some of this energy
is spent reminding the community at large and each other, that the CHamorus as a
people have the right to, and that there is value in, recognizing and maintaining
their own Indigenous set of core values, philosophies, and lifeways (Aguon, 1993;
Bevacqua, n.d.; Borja, 2017; Underwood, 1991, Underwood, n.d.).

An example of muddied issues and competing notions is the political issue of deter-
mining who will partake in Guåhan’s act of self-determination. The United States
placed the island on the UN list of non-self-governing territories in 1946 just after
WWII, thereby creating international recognition that the people of the island have
the right to decolonize (see Benavente, n.d.; The Organic Act of Guam, n.d.; The
Treaty of Paris of 1898, Article IX; United Nations, n.d.). The Government of Guåhan’s
position has long been that the “Native Inhabitants” of the island, a category of
people referred to and defined by the United States in pertinent legal documents,
are those who will vote in a decolonization plebiscite (Native Inhabitants are defined

as those that were present during germane historical events of 1950 or 1898, and their
descendants) (V.-L. Leon Guerero, 2014). Others have stated that the right belongs to
the CHamoru people, while still others feel that every US citizen who is a resident
should participate in the vote. For many, the latter position is extremely controversial
given the rapid demographic changes since 1940 which have created the potential
for non-Native Inhabitants and non-CHamorus to drown out Native Inhabitant and
CHamoru political will regarding the future status of a CHamoru homeland.

In 2011, a non-Native Inhabitant, non-CHamoru resident filed a suit in court to
defend his claimed right to vote in the people of Guåhan’s decolonization process.
Although self-determination is an international right, the ruling of the case was
decided following US domestic law with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
against the Government of Guåhan, striking down the island’s decolonization law as
unconstitutional. The case came to a close when, in 2020, the Supreme Court denied
to review the case. This meant that the 9th Circuit 2019 ruling currently stands. For
many, the issues are still far from settled.

Diversion
While recognizing that CHamorus, like all groups of people, embrace a wide range
of traditional values and practices, it is also true that, to varying degrees and in vary-
ing ways, customary CHamoru values, philosophies, and lifeways are impacted by
the presence of the large number of non-CHamorus in Guåhan (and by having large
numbers of CHamorus living outside the Marianas archipelago). These short- and
long-term community members from other cultures, or even from neighboring
Mariana Islands to the north, arrive in Guåhan with their own cultural, personal, or
other sets of social, political, and cultural interests that may or may not align with
those who are i Taotao Guåhan.

Within this matrix of CHamorus and diverse community members, are a wide variety
of positions depending on a host of factors like cultural identity, family or political
party affiliation, level or type of education, and personal convictions, among others,
as they weigh in on issues like what types of directions the island economy should
go in, what decolonized political status is the best option for us, and more. The end
result, thus, is often a mixture of Indigenous and non-Indigenous community mem-
bers alongside each other in a diversity of social, political, and economic positions.

Part of what has become perhaps more evident in recent years is the dilemma that,
even if long-time residents and newcomers respect the local culture and issues of
Guåhan, they may feel like they do not have a real stake in, or want to interfere in, par-
ticular issues such as militarization, especially regarding Indigenous i Taotao Guåhan
claims to land. These dilemmas can have real consequences in and of themselves.

Take, for example, the public review and comment periods that are a part of the en-
vironmental impact statements prepared for militarization processes that have been
ongoing for the last decade. If community members do not participate or comment
because they do not feel they have a right to weigh in on i Taotao Guåhan issues
or issues they may not be present for in the future, their non-involvement may be
read as consent for the proposed actions. Or, conversely, if they do weigh in, such
thoughts may impact the outcome based on their different non-Indigenous connec-
tions to and ways of conceiving of the land, which can be distinct from that of the
CHamoru worldview, which holds that, “Land is the soul of Chamorro culture. It,
together with the sea, gives life to the Chamorro.” (For further detail regarding these
CHamoru concepts see, Cabrera, et al., 2015; Phillips, n.d.)

Examples of Socio-Cultural and Political Impacts on Daily Life
Many facets of life in Guåhan have been impacted by the history and circumstances
of colonial systems, modernization, and island demographics, each deserving to be
examined in detail to provide nuanced understandings. Here, however, I will briefly
introduce just a few important issues that are part of our daily lives, those revolving
around where we live and around work life and school life, which perhaps feel so
familiar and basic to modern-day living that we may not typically view them as im-
pacting the CHamoru culture and family structure.

Where We Live
In the big picture, it is readily apparent that the core CHamoru value of the primacy
of family still has a strong presence, though it has changed in certain ways (Iyechad,
2001; Marsh, 2019; Souder, 1992, p. 144; Underwood, n.d., p. 14). For example, owing
to the influence of the concept of an American nuclear family and other influences,
“extended” families are less likely to live in family compounds nowadays. It is now
more common for family members to live not only farther apart but in different
villages, islands, states, or even countries (Souder, 1992, p. 144). These more recent

residential patterns are impacting to some degree the time, energy, and types of re-
sources contributed toward fulfilling family obligations that bond and reinforce the
CHamoru family. Advances in technology along with the growth of social media,
and their increased use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, are adding their
own dynamics to these issues allowing for more types of connectivity between
family and friends on-island and off-island.

Work Life
For centuries, a good number of CHamorus resisted fully participating in the cash
economy in many ways during the Spanish and early US colonial administrations,
though there had been a number of extremely successful CHamoru families during
both administrations (A. Leon Guerero, n.d.; Sanchez, 1989, pp. 272–281). The cash
economy gained a stronger foothold during the US administration after WWII
when the CHamoru people and other locals dealt with issues such as bombed and
burned-out lands, dislocation owing to a high number of US military land takings
(including whole villages), and relocation within the island (A. Leon Guerero, n.d.;
Sanchez, 1989, pp. 277–281).

While numerous i Taotao Guåhan have succeeded and earned recognition for
excelling in the workplace (such as within the US military), modern work life has
impacted traditional timelines and motivations for and methods of conducting
“work” in particular ways. For instance, familial and other celebrations nowadays
may have to consider whether they will occur during times outside of working hours
or whether it is now perhaps more convenient or otherwise beneficial to meet family
obligations by contributing cash rather than labor or something personally fished
or hunted, gathered, or harvested (Iyechad, 2001, pp. 172-174).

School Life
While perhaps no one in Guåhan challenges the value of formal education per se,
modern schools operate as cultural entities unto themselves, complete with their
own rules of conduct, processes, and standards (Aguon, 1993). Over the centuries,
i Taotao Guåhan have seen education shift from traditional informal practices of
mentoring and guiding family youth to formal systems instructing youth in which
teachers may spend more time with children than the children’s family.

Island students today receive lessons in classrooms from a mixture of i Taotao
Guåhan, Taotao Sa'ipan, or other CHamorus; long-term residents; newcomers; or
transient instructors who utilize textbooks written, more often than not, for a con-
tinental US setting that does not always translate well to local conditions (though
there are ongoing efforts to more actively develop local curricula). For example,
students may never learn about CHamoru authors such as Peter Onedera, despite
Señot Onedera being formally recognized as Sainan Minenhalom Sinangan Ginen
i Hila' (Master Storyteller), but the students will perhaps instead be taught about
Shakespeare. They will be taught about “spring,” “summer,” “fall,” and “winter”
rather than fañomnåkan and fanuchånan (the “sunny” and “rainy” seasons of the
Mariana Islands). Foreign socio-political and cultural ways of thinking can be em-
bedded in such situations and can challenge Pacific Island cultures and settings if
we do not all work to recognize and mitigate them (Aguon, 1993).

Sa Håfa? What Does It All Mean?
There are many ways we could explore these issues further. Each of the facets of
life discussed above have certain costs and benefits: salaries provide the ability to
support families and fulfill familial obligations, perhaps even in an enhanced fash-
ion; work provides services and goods to Guåhan’s community members; education
and training programs open doors to jobs and careers that are personally satisfying,
benefit the community, and provide salaries that, as noted above, allow us to fulfill
familial obligations; and so on. While no one is necessarily calling for the end to new
residents arriving on Guåhan’s shores, to formal education, or for the end of a cash
economy in Guåhan, it is important to be conscious of the ways that these forces and
the diversity of our community impact cultural philosophies, traditions and lifeways
that are foundational to i Taotao Guåhan culture and the island way of life. Further,
it is important to be aware that the historical circumstances, colonization, and rapid
shifts in demographics have had even wider impacts than those discussed here.

It is no coincidence that communities that suffer historical trauma, rapid changes,
and other events as happened in Låguas yan Gåni end up with wounds and scars
that take concerted effort to address and heal. The story is all too common among
Indigenous communities, wherein a toll is exacted upon the physical and mental
health of Indigenous Peoples as individuals, as families, and as communities. I
Taotao Guåhan and other CHamorus now suffer the highest rates of diabetes,

obesity, hypertension, and cancer, in addition to the highest rates of adult and ju-
venile crime within Guåhan’s diverse ethnic communities (Rapadas et al., 2005). As
i Taotao Guåhan work to heal and move forward, many express an appreciation of
those who recognize the validity of their culture that deserves to be assessed accord-
ing to its own “measuring stick,” and of those who do not treat their culture as a
failed attempt according to someone else’s standards (Figure 9).

Notes

¹Micronesian poets, on the other hand, have made significant contributions
to Pacific literature, led by writers such as Craig Santos Perez and Cecilia
Taitano Perez of Guam, Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner of the Marshall Islands, and
Emelihter Kihleng of Pohnpei.

²See, for example, http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/psi/, a site sponsored by the Pacific
Studies Initiative, a joint project of the University of Hawaiʻi Center for Pacific
Islands Studies and the East-West Center Pacific Islands Development Program
(PIDP) that provides online instructional support, including sample syllabi, for
Pacific-related courses.

³The 11 novels were read as e-books on a Kindle reader, thus the references included in
this paper all refer to the “location number” of the text, rather than the page number.

spot.com/2011/10/i-dendes.html>.

⁵See, for example, the writings of Michael Lujan Bevacqua.

⁶Craig Santos Perez's works are especially noteworthy. See, in particular, his three
collections of poetry: 1 from unincorporated territory [hacha] (2008), 2 from unincor-
porated territory [saina] (2010), and 3 from unincorporated territory [guma'] (2014)–for
which he was honored with the prestigious American Book Award in 2015. He was
also recognized with the 2011 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Poetry and, most
recently, the 2016 Lannen Literary Fellowship.

⁷Tabios (2000) creates a poem by collaging phrases from the authors represented in
Babaylan: An Anthology of Filipina and Filipina American Writers.

⁸My reference to ube as symbolic of Filipino cultural “roots” is because ube is
made from the root of the purple yam. This metaphor is in accordance with my

article, “The Ube (“Roots”) Generation,” published in the December 2016 volume
of Humanities Diliman.

⁹In Identity Formation, Agency, and Culture: A Social Psychological Synthesis, James E.
Côté and Charles G. Levine (2002) describe the numerous difficulties faced by the
descendants of immigrants.

¹⁰The songs in my album were written by my mother, Alpha Espina. Helen Chaco
provided the CHamoru translation in the lyrics.

¹¹The use of personal experience as an introspective, self-reflexive process is
not uncommon in research involving identity and its negotiation, particularly
within diasporic communities. See Nadal (2010), David (2013), Rath (2000), Hall
(1989), and Skinner (2009).

¹²Portes and Rumbaut (2001) found that a thoroughly acculturated third generation
lacks the drive and social resources of their immigrant ancestors, and thus their per-
spectives on American imperialism are largely conditioned by what happened to
their parents and grandparents.

¹³See Constantino (1970).

¹⁴I composed the lyrics, while my mother composed the music.

¹⁵Capitalization is reproduced exactly as it appears in the original.

¹⁶Internalized oppression is defined by David (2013) as a condition in which an op-
pressed individual or group come to believe that they are inferior to those of the
dominant group; it is possibly the most insidious consequence of oppression.

¹⁷According to David (2013), colonial mentality can be perpetuated though the
generations, and these attitudes become more pronounced and exacerbated
through the generations.

¹⁹“The CW-1 nonimmigrant visa program permits employers who meet program
requirements to hire nonimmigrant workers temporarily in the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Island (CNMI or ‘Commonwealth’) to perform services
or labor based on the employer's need. Job opportunities for the CW-1 program
can have validity periods of up to one year and may be renewed for two addition-
al periods of up to one year, with the exception of statutorily defined ‘long-term
workers’ who may receive a certification with a validity period of up to three years,
which may be renewed for additional periods of up to three years” (United States
Department of Labor, n.d.).

²⁰In modern orthography in Guam, the spelling would be “Tåno’ i CHamoru.”

²¹There is a significant amount of detail to this case that this brief descrip-
tion does not provide.

²³In seeing how these arguments can work in the CHamoru case, it is important to
note the differences between CHamorus and “domestic dependent nations.”

the data was compiled, is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

²⁵Speaker code: Island (here: Sa = Saipan), Speaker number, Sex, Age

²⁶The most frequent languages spoken in Saipan at home (population 5 years and
over: 43,871 = 100%) are the Philippine languages with 33%, Chamorro with 22% and
English only with 17% (CNMI Department of Commerce 2010, p. 181; p. 186). The rest
of the languages are spoken less frequently than 10% and are not listed here.

²⁷English as a lingua franca is described as “a ‘contact language’ between persons
who share neither a common Native tongue nor a common (national) culture, and for
whom English is the chosen foreign language of communication” (Firth, 1996, p. 240).

²⁸Speakers adjust their accent or other aspects of language production according to
listener’s speaker style or a desired variety.

²⁹The Peace Corps, however, also were the people who brought about a change in
language attitude towards the Indigenous languages: The value of the local languag-
es was re-discovered and appreciated (Topping, 1985, p. 119).

³⁰For further information about the history of the Saipan Carolinian language and
its possible vanishing, see (Ellis, 2016).

³¹The Carolinians in Saipan call themselves Refaluwasch, the “people of our land,”
which refers to Saipan (cf. Kuehling, 2012, p. 57).

tance to militarization. I do not include statements or documentation from the US

up is available online at http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com.

³³In March 2015, a federal court ruled that these sonar exercises and underwa-
ter detonations in the waters surrounding Hawai‘i and off the coast of California
violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act
(Martinez, 2015). However, the Navy continues to use the same methods within
the Mariana Islands Training and Testing (MITT) program. See: https://www.
nrdc.org/media/2015/150331-0. Also see Chapter 1 of the Special Report, Pacific
Outpost in the Civil Beat by Anita Hofschneider, 12 December 2016. (Hofschneider,

³⁴In addition, the US military must follow Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, a separate consultation process to determine the “poten-
tial effects of the proposed action on historic properties.” Available at http://

³⁵In April 2017, the DOD scheduled additional meetings before the revision EIS
has been released. In addition, they were scheduled with very short notice and
took place from 2–4 pm during the workday (Villahermosa, 2017). For more,
see Rep. Demapan’s concerns: http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/
local/94776-rep-angel-demapan-questions-cjmt-meetings.

³⁶Adams also says that the CNMI is “one of the poorest, most isolated and least
well-represented entities in the US.” Brian Turner, an attorney at the National Trust
for Historic Preservation, says the EIS proposal demonstrates “environmental in-
justice” and “if this sort of thing were proposed in North Carolina [the continental
United States], it just would never happen” (Hofschneider, 2016a).

³⁷In addition to the LFTRC on Tinian, another example of the US Military environ-
mental contamination legacy are the 42 leaking oil fuel tanks abandoned by the US
Navy in the 1960s in Saipan, known as the “Tanapag Fuel Farm.” This is in addition
to the millions of pounds of Unexploded Ordnance (UXOs) (Hofschneider, 2016a).

³⁸It would also (ironically) destroy the first peace monument built by US Navy
Seabees in 1945 in Tinian after the Japanese Imperial Forces surrendered. In addi-
tion, the training would potentially destroy 200 sites that are eligible for the National
Register for Historic Places (Hofschneider, 2016c).

⁴²According to the 2015 Mariana Islands Training and Testing (MITT) proposal every
island in the archipelago is categorized as a “potential location” for a Live Fire
Training Range Complex (LFTRC).

⁴³I believe online petitions do serve a purpose, since this petition was a post I
shared on the Oceania Resistance Facebook page and reached hundreds of people
beyond the archipelago.

⁴⁴This is highlighted in the article, “Resisting Political Colonization and American
Militarization in the Marianas Archipelago,” I created for AlterNative: International
Journal of Indigenous Studies (Frain, 2016).

⁴⁵On December 5, 2016, the US Department of the Navy filed a motion to dismiss
the lawsuit of four environmental groups for lack of jurisdiction (Manabat, 2016).
However, the groups maintain their right to sue (Torre, 2017).

⁴⁶Farallon de Medenilla, or FDM as it is commonly referenced, was a name given
to the island under Spanish colonial rule, but the Indigenous Chamorro name for
the island is No’os (personal communication with historian Genevieve S. Cabrera).

⁴⁷Specifically, Section 802 of the CNMI Covenant reads: “(a) The following property
will be made available to the Government of the United States by lease to enable it
to carry out its defense responsibilities: (1) on Tinian Island, approximately 17,799
acres (7,203 hectares) and the waters immediately adjacent thereto; (2) on Saipan
Island, approximately 177 acres (72 hectares) at Tanapag Harbor; and (3) on Farallon
de Medinilla Island, approximately 206 acres (83 hectares) encompassing the entire
island, and the waters immediately adjacent thereto (b) The United States affirms
that it has no present need for or present intention to acquire any greater interest in
property listed above than that which is granted to it under Subsection 803(a), or to
acquire any property in addition to that listed in Subsection (a), above, in order to
carry out its defense responsibilities” (CNMI Covenant, n.d.).

⁴⁸This terminology was employed in a number of personal communications on
Saipan during conversations that took place beginning in 2006 onward when com-
munity members were describing the military’s presence in the Marianas after WWII.

⁴⁹The Marianas Political Status Commission in 1975, defined the “Covenant” as a
“binding agreement like a contract or compact and the title used for this agreement
is not intended to have independent legal significance. This title seems appropriate
because the relationship between the United States and the Northern Marianas
will be a permanent one, which in its fundamental respects will not be able to be
changed by one party without the consent of the other” (To Approve, 1975).

⁵⁰It should be noted that, according to Smith (1991), “The Marianas plebiscite on
future status held in 1975, notwithstanding the size of the vote for a Commonwealth
(78.8% with a turnout of over 90%) failed to include independence or free association
options. The options required by UN decolonization principles were not offered and
the status of this act of ‘self-determination’ was criticized by a number of legal schol-
ars. The failure to present other options reflects an agreement by both the United
States and political leaders in the Northern Marianas to push the matter through as
quickly as possible, and implied some lack of confidence in the islander’s support
for Commonwealth status” (p. 36). Historically, it is understood that the members
of the Congress of Micronesia (a bicameral legislature created in 1965 during the
TTPI) were not in agreement with the members of the Marianas delegation in the
1960’s about the Northern Marianas desiring a closer political union with the United
States. (McPhetres, 1997).

⁵¹The importance of the Insular Cases also highlights the court’s reliance on Rice vs.
Cayetano as a tool for understanding indigeneity in the Marianas. While the forma-
tion of a Northern Marianas Descent identity was not intended to map onto race,
it has sometimes been conflated with race and is viewed as a direct violation of the
U.S. fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. However, the use of Rice vs. Cayetano to
understand race relations in the CNMI is problematic and has been problematized
by a number of legal scholars (Aguon, 2009; Torres, 2012; Villazor, 2018).

⁵²While I am not suggesting that the CNMI is legally defined as a territory, it has
often been presented as undistinguishable from other territories in terms of federal

policies. Horey (2003) has argued that politically, this has been an outcome of the
“overall federal tendency … to ignore the unique circumstances of the CNMI, and
lump it together with the traditional U.S. territories.” (p. 182) In theory, this distinc-
tion is important, since commonwealth status affords the Northern Mariana Islands
with a level of autonomy that other territories do not have, such as the right to
self-government and the creation of the CNMI Covenant and Constitution.

⁵³Fallon (1991) argues that the term “‘commonwealth’ has no precise definition for
the U.S. Government” (p. 26) and points to the historically arbitrary use of the term
by other U.S. states such as Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia; as well as the Philippines’ short-term use of the term between 1935–1946. For
further discussion of the “graded, political limbo” that “the federal government has
consigned” to it’s eight insular territories, including American Samoa, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas, Palau,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, see Joseph E. Fallon’s (1991) “Federal Policy
and U.S. Territories: The Political Restructuring of the United States of America.” A
similar assessment of national belonging is addressed by Barreto and Lazaro who
write that there are “varying degrees of national belonging.”

⁵⁴At the time of this writing, Guam was listed under Chapter XI of the Charter of the
United Nation’s list of Non-Self-Governing Territories (NSGT) which are defined by
the United Nations as “territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure
of self-government.”

⁵⁵This bill was submitted around the same time that major increases in military
planning were being discussed. For example, it was submitted shortly before
the Final Record of Decision (ROD) for the Marine Relocation and the Final
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Mariana Islands Training and
Testing (MITT) was released.

⁵⁶The first political status commission refers to the original Covenant agreement
made in 1975 between the CNMI and the United States of America.

⁵⁷The three issues being referred to are: 1) The CNMI’s legal struggle to retain
control over the submerged lands surrounding the Marianas 2) the increasing
militarization of the islands and surrounding sea and airspace, and 3) the U.S.’s deci-
sion to federalize the CNMI immigration system which up until 2008, had been run
by the CNMI Government.

⁵⁸Chamorro scholar Keith Camacho (2011) conducted an analysis of Chamorro and
Filipino social movements in the Marianas and argues that the ensuing federaliza-
tion of the CNMI immigration system due to labor violations can be understood as
a move to further militarize the region through the logic of border policing. This ar-
gument is instructive of the way in which all three issues fall under the umbrella of
militarism. It is also worthwhile to note that the precarious economic situation in the
CNMI that was left in the wake of federal immigration, has produced a further reli-
ance on militarization as a means for economic revenue. For example, in the CNMI’s
Comprehensive Economic Development Plan 2009–2014, the document notes that,
“Although faced with many economic challenges the Commonwealth looks to an
opportunity which is already bringing in new investment to the region. The planned
military buildup, which is the planned move of Marines from Okinawa to Guam,
will undoubtedly bring both positive and negative challenges” (Commonwealth
Economic Development Strategic Planning Commission, 2009).

⁵⁹This public presentation was entitled “U.S. Constitutional Rights in the Territories
and the CNMI,” and was held at American Memorial Park on July 8, 2018. It was
hosted by the Honorable Gustavo A. Gelpi from Puerto Rico and the Honorable Jose
S. Dela Cruz from Saipan (CNMI).

⁶⁰The largest of these incidents is now described as the “Jack Abramoff CNMI
scandal,” which involved U.S. lobbyists and other government officials swaying
Congressional actions in the CNMI.

⁶¹See Alia Wong and Lenika Cruz’s (2018) critique of mainland America’s scant cov-
erage of Typhoon Yutu in their article entitled “The Media Barely Covered One of
the Worst Storms to Hit U.S. Soil” published in The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.
com/science/archive/2018/11/super-typhoon-yutu-mainstream-media-missed-north
ern-mariana-islands/575692/

⁶²To be clear, I am not arguing that voting rights are not important, but instead
that fighting for equality based on an assimilationist discourse propounded by
United States policies does not go “far enough” in alleviating the deeply asym-
metrical socio-political and economic structural relations that characterize the
US-CNMI relationship. This argument aligns itself with Indigenous scholarship in
North America that recognizes both the possibilities and limitations of describing
Indigenous struggles within the framework of “human and civil rights based social
justice projects” (Tuck & Yang, 2012, p. 1).

⁶³The eight insular territories include American Samoa, the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM), Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas, Palau,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The political status of the islands are as
follows: FSM (Free Association), Marshall Islands (Free Association), Palau (Free
Association), Northern Marianas (Commonwealth, unincorporated), Puerto Rico
(Commonwealth, unincorporated), Guam (unincorporated), U.S. Virgin Islands
(unincorporated), American Samoa (unincorporated).

⁶⁴Both the CNMI and Guam are considered “organized and unincorporated” (Fallon,
1991, p. 25) despite their different political statuses.

⁶⁵For an in-depth discussion of Article XII and its usage in the local court system in
the CNMI and Guam, see “Problematizing the Protection of Culture and the Insular
Cases” by Rose Cuison Villazor (2018) and “Reading Between the (Blood) Lines” by
Rose Cuison Villazor (2010). While the legal ramifications of these tensions have
continued to play out at the time of this writing, the question of whether US laws
can accommodate for Indigenous rights in the CNMI is outside the scope of this
writing. However, I draw attention to Article XII to highlight the longer and more
enduring role of US political power and its ability to transform the politics of
indigeneity in the CNMI.

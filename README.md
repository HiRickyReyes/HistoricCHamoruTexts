# HistoricCHamoruTexts
Digital humanities project that collected and digitized historical texts on Guam and CHamoru culture. During the process files were converted to TEI and analyzed using TF-IDF, co-occurrence, sentiment analysis and topic modeling to explore narratives written BY insider-authors compared to outsider-authors.

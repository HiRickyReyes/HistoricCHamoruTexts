                <p>This book is intended for the general reader and for students of the history, politics, and governments of the Pacific region. The method followed is one of linear narrative history beginning with the initial written records of Guam by members of the 1521 Magellan expedi- tion who were the first Europeans to make contact with the island. An underlying assumption is that actual history does not change, but it is constantly rediscovered through historiography (accounts of his- tory and the methods of studying it), which does change as previously unknown information comes to light and new theories are postulated. Thus historical accounts are constantly being rewritten, as will be this one. Moreover, in multiethnic settings such as postcontact Guam, his- tories are shared and cultures are porous, so the author believes there is no inherent superiority of “insider” (i.e., someone indigenous to a place today) versus “outsider” viewpoints, particularly about the distant past. The writer of this account is an outsider to Guam but welcomes all subaltern accounts of the island’s history that cite local sources of historical agency.</p>
                <p>One reason for a canonical narrative approach in this book through a Kantian ethical idea of history is to limit the fragmentation and ten- dency toward advocacy and teleology sometimes found in thematic and theory-driven poststructural modes of historical analysis (good for concepts, poor for narrative drive and objectivity). The author be- lieves narrative best provides cohesiveness to a story for students and the nonspecialist reader.</p>
                <p>The central problem addressed in this account is a political one: after more than a century of rule over Guam, the United States, con- trary to its own ideals, has yet to provide full democratic participation by the people of the island in determining their own destiny. There-</p>
                <p>fore this history is not just about the indigenous Chamorro culture of Guam, but about the efforts of all the people who came to the island— regardless of origin and whether they were the rulers or the ruled—to maintain their moral integrity in a colonial setting.</p>

                <p>Guam</p>
                <p>Center of the First Province</p>
                <p>Guam became the first inhabited island in the Pa- cific Ocean known to Europeans when Ferdinand Magellan, sailing under the flag of Spain, stepped ashore there in the year 1521. Magellan’s fateful landfall not only opened the Pacific to European ex- ploration, it also led to foreign domination of every traditional island society throughout that immense third of the earth’s surface the Europeans called Oceania. During the historical transformation of the Pacific world in the centuries since Magellan, lit- tle Guam—only thirty miles long by about ten miles wide and 214 square miles in area—has played a strategic role far more significant than islands much larger, much less isolated, and much better known.</p>
                <p>Beyond its importance to those who live there, Guam is significant for the rest of the world due pri- marily to its topography and the value of its loca- tion to major powers in the Pacific. In other words, Guam is important internationally because of the enduring imperatives of geopolitics, an enormous force in the histories of small, strategically located islands, straits, and canals.</p>
                <p>Guam is the largest and the most populated of the Mariana Islands. The Marianas are fifteen high volcanic islands that form a north-south archipela- go nearly 500 miles long in the tropics about 1,500 miles east of the Philippine Islands. The main is- lands—Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan—lie in the</p>
                <p>southern end of the chain and have two climatic sea- sons: one dry from January to about June, the other wet from June to January. Guam receives nearly 100 inches of rain annually. The wet season produces a high incidence of tropical cyclonic storms, the most powerful of which are typhoons (called hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Eastern Pacific) with sus- tained winds higher than 74 miles per hour. Every few years Guam also experiences the cruel impacts of supertyphoons with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour or higher.</p>
                <p>The Marianas are a natural geographic entity with a distinctive cultural and ethnic heritage from the indigenous Chamorro people. Today, the Mari- anas are divided into two partially self-governing colonies with differing political statuses under the sovereignty of the United States of America: the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (abbreviated as the CNMI and composed of Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and nearby islands), and the U.S. Ter- ritory of Guam. How they came to be separated by recurring foreign conquests is a subject of this history.</p>
                <p>As the southernmost island, Guam sits almost dead center in the huge expanse of the western Pa- cific north of the equator. About half of that area is the politically distinct region of Micronesia, for which Guam serves as the commercial and military</p>
                <p>hub. Micronesia is one of the three great insular regions—along with Polynesia and Melanesia—of Oceania, which in the past was at times included by Europeans and Americans in the “South Seas” or the “South Pacific.” In 1817, the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue appropriately called Micronesia the “First Province of the Great Ocean.”</p>
                <p>Within that province on the great circle axis that crosses 5,000 miles of the Pacific between Hawai‘i and the Philippines, Guam is the largest island with a protected major harbor and sufficient land for several airports. Similarly, on the nearly 3,000-mile north-south axis from Japan to Papua New Guinea, Guam again is the largest and most useful landfall for communications, shipping, and military bases.</p>
                <p>The Marianas also lie astride the northeast trade winds and the north equatorial ocean current that flows westward across the Pacific above the dol- drums of the intertropical convergence zone along the equator. It was Ferdinand Magellan’s genius in the sixteenth century to follow the northeast trades when they blow strongest from January through March. The winds and the current carried him straight to the Marianas after he had rounded South America and turned westward. Ever since then, ships have used the same winds, the same current, and the same islands to cross the Pacific from east to west above the equator.</p>
                <p>The history of Guam since European contact has been—and continues to be—determined primarily by outside colonial factors such as religion, com- merce, and strategic politico-military considerations beyond the control of the Chamorro people. Guam, in short, was destined after Magellan to be a pawn in the realpolitik of foreign powers. As a conse- quence, alien military forces repeatedly invaded the island, and it has been occupied by outsiders for the incredible span of over 330 years. Yet the im- pact was not fatal, as it was for many other island peoples, notably in the Caribbean. The Chamorro people of Guam, small in numbers and vulnerable geographically, adapted to the harsh new conditions imposed by each tidal wave of conquerors. They were not just passive victims of their colonizers. In a remarkable feat of cultural endurance, they changed</p>
                <p>themselves and maintained their language, their in- tegrity, and their pride under the often harsh colo- nial domination of three of history’s most powerful nation-states: Spain, Japan, and the United States of America. The indigenous identity—much changed but still distinct—survives, and the Chamorros have even regained a large measure of local political con- trol of their island though Guam remains a colony in a postcolonial world. That survival against enor- mous adversity makes Guam and the Chamorro people special.</p>
                <p>Now, in the twenty-first century, Americanized, modern, multiethnic, and still one of the world’s last colonies, Guam continues to fulfill the geopo- litical role imposed on it by outsiders centuries ago. In place of Spanish galleons, Guam now serves in- ternational airlines, nuclear-powered submarines, space satellites, and all the other creations of mod- ern humans that have followed for good or bad in Magellan’s momentous wake.</p>
                <p>All this, however, was in the future as Magellan approached Guam in the month of March in the year 1521. This resourceful Portuguese captain, frustrated in service to his own king, had been sent in 1519 by Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain (as Charles I), to find the five Spice Islands of the Moluccas by sailing south around and then west beyond the still-mysterious New World found by Columbus only twenty-seven years earlier. Charles V wanted the sources of pre- cious cloves and other spices for Spain before Por- tugal could claim them in the two kingdoms’ violent rivalry for empire. By 1519, the Portuguese were sailing around Africa and across the Indian Ocean to reach the Moluccas by sailing eastward.</p>
                <p>Magellan successfully dodged Portuguese fleets hunting him in the Atlantic, and in late 1520 he threaded the dangerous straits that would bear his name on the southern tip of the New World. Then he struck out boldly into the Pacific Ocean with three sun-cracked and poorly provisioned ships: the Trinidad, the Concepcion, and the Victoria. The flo- tilla first sailed northwestward into the Pacific from South America, sailing hundreds of miles south of and then westward beyond the Hawaiian Islands,</p>
                <p>which were unknown to the Spaniards and other Europeans until the eighteenth century.</p>
                <p>Magellan knew from experience in the Atlantic Ocean that oceanic trade winds blow steadily out of the northeast in a band above the 12° N latitude. He may have sought similar winds above the equa- tor in order to traverse the Pacific above the south- ern latitudes, where the hostile Portuguese lurked in the East Indies. Magellan and some of his crew had served earlier under the Portuguese flag in the Mo- luccas and in the southern Philippines.</p>
                <p>The route taken by Magellan across the Pacific was therefore not entirely an accident, but a calcu- lated gamble. His general track was deliberate (he sought the equinoctial line of the celestial equator) even though the distances and the islands along the route were unknown to him and his pilots.</p>
                <p>When the Spanish vessels were above the equator in the Pacific and into the trade winds, Magellan turned west and sailed downwind on a fairly steady course. By March 5 they had been sailing for over three months since departing South America. No in- habited islands were found, only a few silent palm- studded islets in an otherwise empty and endless ocean. It was the dry season in the tropics, and rain rarely fell to replenish the near-empty water casks.</p>
                <p>The crews had not yet learned to troll for the easily caught dolphin fish (dorado in Spanish and Cory- phaena hipurus to marine biologists). These deli- cious gilded fish are plentiful in the Pacific in that season. Instead, Magellan and his crews ate rats, sawdust, and ox-hide rigging. Men began to sicken and die from a combination of thirst, semistarva- tion, and scurvy.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the tattered little flotilla groped resolutely on across the great mother ocean of the world into longitudes beyond any known to Eu- ropeans at the time. These longitudes would soon unveil to them the Philippines. Before reaching the Philippines, however, Magellan’s flotilla would first land on Guam. If fate is preordained but destiny is not, then much of humankind’s loss of innocence on this island called earth is mirrored in the often tragic but inspiring history of the island of Guam since Magellan’s landfall.</p>
                <p>This is the story of that special island, a small green oasis in the vast blue reaches of the Pacific Ocean. My purpose in telling this story is to rec- oncile the politics of human culture with historical event in an account of a specific colonial experience, an experience not yet ended.</p>

                <p>Aliens 1521-1638</p>
                <p>First Intrusion</p>
                <p>On Wednesday, March 6, 1521, as the sun began to rise over the western Pacific Ocean, a tired and hungry seaman on the dawn watch of Magellan’s flagship Trinidad saw a silent blue shore material- ize out of the dark haze on the northwestern hori- zon off the ship’s starboard bow. It appeared to be a high island. Then a smaller dark bump loomed above the rim of the sea just to the south of the first shape. The seaman, who was in the ship’s crow’s nest nearly sixty feet above water level, waited anx- iously, staring hard to make sure that the shapes were not clouds. Convinced they were land, the lookout finally raised the cry that would reverberate down through history, “;Tierra! jTierra!”</p>
                <p>Below him on the main deck, the mixed crew of Spaniards, Basques, Italians, Portuguese, French- men, Greeks, and even an Englishman scrambled to the starboard rail, some thanking God, others laughing through gums swollen and cracked by scurvy. Aft on the high poop deck, Captain General Ferdinand Magellan, a lame, heavily bearded, and implacably determined man, limped to the rail and squinted at the horizon to the northwest. Quickly several men gathered beside him; they were his of- ficers and pilots and one extroverted young Italian nobleman, Antonio Pigafetta, who was personal gentleman-in-waiting to Magellan and unofficial chronicler of the voyage. The men on the decks of</p>
                <p>the ships could see two mesa-like shapes, one small, the other large, approximately twenty miles off their starboard bows, but the low peninsula that connect- ed the shapes remained hidden below the horizon, so the land to the northwest looked like two islands to everyone on the decks.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, the Trinidad’s lookout yelled again and pointed to the southwest. There an oblong shore- line of steep brown cliffs glistened low on the sun- lit horizon about twenty miles off the port bow of the Trinidad. Although not as high as the first land sighted, the island to the southwest was broader.</p>
                <p>Magellan studied the islands with the sharp eyes of a master mariner as the trade winds rose brisk- ly behind his ships in the tropical sun’s heat. The daytime winds pushed his three small square-rigged naos (which would evolve into galleons; maos de- rived from carracks used in Mediterranean trade) up to eight knots per hour in the heavy white-capped swells of the Pacific Ocean. Sails had not been re- set for weeks because of the reliable winds out of the northeast, brisas to the Spaniards, and because of the weak state of the crews. The brisas and the north equatorial current had kept the flotilla steady on a westward course along the 14° to 15° N lati- tudes. After sighting land, Magellan did not imme- diately alter course; the flotilla sailed on for another hour or so until the ships were between the islands.</p>
                <p>ALIENS 1521-1638</p>
                <p>The larger island to the southwest was down- wind. Magellan could see that it would be safer to land on its leeward side than to tack to the is- land to the northwest. One of the Victoria’s pilots, a Greek from Rhodes named Francisco Albo, later wrote in his log, probably after talking to his ship’s lookout as was customary, “And on this day we saw land and we went to it, and there were two islands, which were not very large, and when we came be- tween them we headed to the southwest, and we left one to the northwest.” Although unknown to Magellan and his men, the island first sighted was Rota, which initially appears as two islands when seen from the southeast. The larger island to the southwest toward which they turned was Guam.</p>
                <p>Years later in Europe, when Pigafetta wrote his vivid chronicle of Magellan’s voyage, he recalled only the two peaks of Rota and the one island of Guam. He thus described that historic first landfall as three islands, not two, as Albo and other pilots recorded. Pigafetta also reversed the north-south directions of the islands, as was sometimes done on maps at that time. The errors by Pigafetta or by the scribes who copied and translated various ver- sions of his chronicle puzzled historians for centu- ries. They conjectured several alternative landfalls in the Marianas, such as Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, in order to conform to Pigafetta’s account. Albo’s log and the sparse accounts of Magellan’s other pi- lots, notably that of an anonymous Genoese pilot confirming Albo’s description, give a more accurate nautical picture of the landfall on Guam than does Pigafetta’s.</p>
                <p>As Magellan’s three ships sailed toward Guam, Albo wrote, “We saw many small sails which were coming to us.” These were the remarkable Micro- nesian outrigger canoes called proas, each with a single triangular lateen sail. The proas nimbly dart- ed around Magellan’s clumsy ships as they neared Ritidian Point, Guam’s northernmost tip. Pigafetta wrote that the proas were “like dolphins jumping from wave to wave.”</p>
                <p>The islanders in the proas were tawny stalwart men, according to Pigafetta. They stood taller than the Spaniards, had straight black hair, and were com-</p>
                <p>7</p>
                <p>pletely naked. Because the Spaniards were searching for the Indies in the early period of their explora- tions, they referred to all brown-skinned people by the term indios (Indians) or nativos (natives) when first encountered in the New World and in the Pa- cific and Asia. By the time Spain claimed Guam in 1565, the indigenous people of the Marianas would sometimes be called Chamurres, the Spanish version of the local term chamorri, which is what the island- ers called members of their high caste.</p>
                <p>The early Spanish sailors also interpreted chamurre to mean “friend.” Eventually, the local people would be known variously as Marianos, Chamorris, and finally Chamorros after Father Diego Luis de San Vitores arrived to establish a Je- suit mission on Guam in 1668. The modern words “Chamorro” in English and “Chamoru” in the Cha- morro language to describe the island’s people are, therefore, indigenous in origin, as well as perhaps an adaptation of the old Spanish word chamorro for “bald” or “shorn” (“beardless” in Portuguese), which described some island men who wore only a topknot on an otherwise shaved head. No known records of Magellan’s stay at Guam reported an in- digenous name of the island, a curious omission for one of the most significant landfalls in human his- tory, the first to prove the earth was round.</p>
                <p>About noon, as Magellan’s flotilla passed Ritidian Point on Guam’s northernmost tip, the ships slowed to just a few knots speed when the wind dropped in the lee of the high cliffs along the island’s northwest shore. From Ritidian, Magellan cruised cautiously in safe deep water outside low reefs marked by moder- ate surf. Inside the reefs along the coast are shallow lagoons, each from about fifty to several hundred yards across and lined on shore by narrow, palm- fringed beaches. Behind the beaches are a series of flat enclaves a mile to several miles in width and up to a half mile deep. Each enclave ends against steep, jungle-clad slopes or rocky, reddish-grey cliffs that lead up to a limestone plateau. This broad, flat pla- teau forms the northern half of Guam.</p>
                <p>Every enclave along the beaches contains lush coconut groves and freshwater springs or streams that flow out of the limestone plateau above. Each</p>

                <p>enclave also held villages with numerous Chamor- ros in Magellan’s time. Ahead, Magellan could see a number of rocky points between more enclaves, and, in the distance about fifteen miles away, a large point of land—now Orote Peninsula—juts out near- ly five miles due west. Mountains, green with grass- covered summits and heavy jungle on their lower slopes, rise in the south beyond Orote Peninsula. Hungry, thirsty, and surrounded by proas with Chamorros full of curiosity beginning to climb up</p>
                <p>the sides of the ships, Magellan and his crews were probably eager to take on water and provisions. It is unlikely that they would have wandered on for an- other six to eight hours around Orote Peninsula to reach the bay of Umatac on the southwestern coast after nightfall on an unknown coast. Later oral tradition among the Chamorros claimed Magellan landed at Umatac. This tradition may have derived from the next landing by Europeans, that of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi forty-four years later in 1565 at</p>
                <p>ALIENS 1521-1638</p>
                <p>Umatac, when he stayed thirteen days, and from the subsequent stops of galleons at Umatac.</p>
                <p>By late afternoon on March 6, Magellan’s flotilla was probably off Tumon Bay or Agana Bay, which present calm water and low reefs. Large villages on these bays indicated to the thirsty Spaniards that fresh water was available. By this time, Chamorros were swarming over the ships and carrying away anything loose. Magellan ordered his men to clear the boarders from the ships. The Europeans, too weak to manhandle the sturdy Chamorros, started firing crossbows.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros had never seen ordinary bows and arrows, much less the metal-backed crossbows. The cultural shock was deadly. Pigafetta relates that, when struck in the body by an arrow, the Cha- morros “drew it forth with much astonishment, and immediately afterwards they died.” The crossbows were sufficient to chase off the boarders. Some later historical accounts of the fighting say firearms were used, but neither Pigafetta nor other eyewitnesses report their use, so it appears that the Spaniards did not fire their arquebuses or muskets in this initial encounter.</p>
                <p>In the fighting the Chamorros deftly made off with a rowboat towed behind the Trinidad. This skiff was important. The crew used it to sound depths with a weighted line ahead of the ship in unknown shallow waters. Angry at the theft and apprehensive of the numerous islanders as the sun began to set, Magellan had his ships tack offshore for the night without anchoring.</p>
                <p>The next morning, according to the Genoese pi- lot’s account, the ships returned and anchored just off the reef where the skiff had been taken. Each of Magellan’s ships carried a pinnace, or ship’s boat, on deck. A pinnace held up to twenty armed men who could easily row it through the surf over the reef in a medium or high tide in March. The crews lowered two pinnaces for Magellan and a party of about forty men in armor to go ashore and recover the skiff.</p>
                <p>So it was that the first Europeans to land on an inhabited island in the Pacific Ocean stepped ashore ona beach along Guam’s northwest coast on Thurs-</p>
                <p>9</p>
                <p>day morning, March 7, 1521. The newcomers were hostile and intent on imposing their will on the local people. Magellan’s men proceeded to burn forty to fifty huts and several proas. They killed eight Cha- morros who resisted, and they retrieved the skiff with no casualties.</p>
                <p>Despite the violence of that first encounter, some Chamorros continued the next day to exchange food for Spanish goods, particularly for anything made of iron. Magellan’s flotilla remained on Guam three days. During that time, Pigafetta and others visited the villages. The Chamorros impressed Pi- gafetta as “ingenious and great thieves.”</p>
                <p>The Europeans were unaware of a traditional custom among many Pacific islanders whereby new arrivals on an island present gifts to their hosts, who can take whatever they wish from the newcomers. The Chamorros, a communal people, also did not share the European’s concept of individual items as private possessions not to be taken without the per- mission of the owner. Pigafetta noted that the Cha- morros “have no lord or superior” and were not awed by the Europeans, perhaps because the latter appeared weak and bedraggled after their harrow- ing trans-Pacific voyage. There is no indication in the accounts written by early Europeans of their vis- its to the Marianas that the Chamorros viewed the outsiders as gods or divine in any way.</p>
                <p>One result of the episode of the stolen skiff was that Magellan named the islands the Islas de los Ladrones (Islands of Thieves). This misnomer clung to the archipelago for three centuries despite the later name change to the Mariana Islands by Fa- ther Diego Luis de San Vitores in 1668 in honor of Mariana of Austria, the Spanish queen regent who funded a Catholic mission in the islands. To add to the confusion over names, the islands were also lat- er called the Islands of Lateen Sails by Magellan and continued to be so titled by some historians.</p>
                <p>On Saturday morning, March 9, according to Albo, Magellan set sail west by southwest away from Guam. No other islands were seen until the flotilla reached the Philippines. Pigafetta noted that a hundred or so proas followed the Spaniards for miles with the Chamorros holding up fish as if to</p>

                <p>The first map of the Mariana Islands. The original was drawn in Europe between 1523 and 1527 for the chronicle written by An- tonio Pigafetta about the Magellan voyage. This version was drawn for a copy of the chronicle in French. North is at the bottom, as was the custom at the time. The large island on top titled Isles des Larrons (Islands of Thieves) is Guam. The two islands at the bottom are actually one island, Rota, of which Pigafetta saw only two peaks beyond the horizon. This is also the first picture</p>
                <p>of a Chamorro proa. Note the crow’s nest and the two crewmen in typically European clothes, inaccuracies that indicate the draw- ing was done by a European artist from Pigafetta’s descriptions. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>trade, then hurling stones when the ships did not halt. With that bad omen, the first European con- tact with Pacific islanders ended.</p>
                <p>The encounter set a precedent that became a tragic pattern in later Spanish-Chamorro relations. The great cultural differences in the values and be- havior of the two sides led repeatedly to hostility and armed conflict. The Spaniards invariably won</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>these clashes because of better unity and discipline by their military forces, and by their more advanced technology in metal, arms, and ships. Guam and the Pacific still reverberate to the impact of Magellan. He was a human meteor from an alien cosmos, the universe of Europe, which forever altered the Pacific world.</p>
                <p>ALIENS 1521-1638</p>
                <p>Magellan’s expedition sailed away to the Philip- pines and to the captain general’s death in battle at Mactan Island in April 1521. Subsequently, the Concepcion was burned at Bohol Island because of insufficient men to crew all three ships. The remain- ing two ships wandered southward to reach Tidore, one of the five Spice Islands in the Moluccas, in November 1521, where cargoes of cloves were ob- tained. The Trinidad by then was leaking so badly it had to have a major overhaul. The sturdy little Victoria would continue westward under Captain Juan Sebastian de Elcano with Pigafetta and Albo still aboard. It departed Tidore in December 1521 and arrived in San Lucar de Barrameda, Seville’s ocean port at the mouth of the Guadalquivir Riv- er in Spain, in September 1522 after an agonizing voyage across the Indian Ocean and around Africa. Only eighteen men survived, but the globe finally encompassed became a globe reduced forever after that epic first circumnavigation of planet Earth. Back on Tidore in the Moluccas, the Trini- dad took until April 1522 to be repaired. Captain Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, with a small cargo of cloves, then attempted to return eastward back across the Pacific with the Trinidad to reach Darien in Panama, where Vasco Nunez de Balboa earlier had established Spanish settlements. This course meant that the Trinidad sailed against the brisas of the northeast trade winds, which proved impossible. The ship struggled into the northeast winds up to the northern arc of the Mariana Islands, reaching in June an island at 18° 44’ N latitude. The Spaniards named the island Cyco or La Griega, now known as Agrihan. The Chamorros on Agrihan behaved so aggressively that Espinosa could not anchor, but, in a normal European tactic, he kidnapped one of them to augment his crew and provide information. Beating on against the wind, the Trinidad reached approximately 42° N in the temperate zone, where a storm battered the ship for five days. With the Trini- daa’s sails in tatters, the Spaniards were forced to turn back and soon anchored inside a ring of three small islands at about 20° N latitude. The Chamor- ro captive called the largest island, which had only twenty Chamorro inhabitants, Mao or Pamo, ac-</p>
                <p>11</p>
                <p>cording to the Genoese pilot who was aboard. From its description, the island was present-day Maug. The captive also apparently provided the Spaniards for the first time the Chamorro names for each of the Marianas, including Guahan for Guam. These names appeared on a Portuguese map in 1545, but the map was filed away or kept secret and forgotten until the twentieth century.</p>
                <p>At Maug, the Chamorro captive was released, but three European crewmen deserted the jinxed Trinidad. One of these men was Gonzalo Alvarez de Vigo. Two of the deserters were killed by the Cha- morros, but Gonzalo survived, the first of many Eu- ropeans to jump ship and become a beachcomber on the lovely isles of Micronesia. The Spaniards would later learn much about the Marianas when Gonzalo was retrieved on Guam in September 1526 by the next expedition to the Pacific, that of General Juan Garcia Jofre de Loaysa.</p>
                <p>Espinosa’s information and Gonzalo de Vigo’s later elaboration revealed the significance of the Marianas for the navigation of the eastward passage across the north Pacific back to Mexico. Pushed by the southwest monsoon in June and July, a ship on a northeast course from the Philippines passes near the northern islands of the Marianas. Espinosa showed that these islands could serve as landfalls to take on provisions or as landmarks for voyages back across the north Pacific to California and then south to Mexico. This would become the route of the Spanish galleons from Manila.</p>
                <p>The Trinidad barely limped back to the Moluc- cas, where it was driven ashore and destroyed by a sudden squall at Ternate in the Spice Islands in Oc- tober 1522. Eventually, only four of the Trinidad’s brave crew, including Espinosa and the pilot Ginés de Mafra, returned to Spain with information about their voyages. That information would be crucial in future Spanish probes into the Pacific.</p>
                <p>Stepping Stone to the Philippines</p>
                <p>After the Victoria with its meager but precious car- go of thirty tons of precious cloves and other spices docked at Seville in September 1522, the Spanish</p>
                <p>12</p>
                <p>and the Portuguese kings immediately fell to argu- ing over which of them owned the spices and the right of access to the Moluccas. The Spaniards parried Portuguese claims based on the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, which divided Columbus’ New World in the Americas between the two kingdoms on a line drawn by Pope Alexander VI in a papal bull in 1493. It was unclear from the treaty where the pope’s line of demarcation fell on the other side of the globe among the Molucca Islands in what to- day is part of Indonesia. Within the Moluccas lie the five small Spice Islands so avidly sought by Europe- ans in the sixteenth century.</p>
                <p>Both kingdoms secretly prepared new expedi- tions to seize the Moluccas while they negotiated. The Portuguese approach was eastward from bas- es in Africa across the Indian Ocean to a forward base in Malacca on the Malay Peninsula and then to the Spice Islands. The initial Spanish approach was westward across the Atlantic and south around South America and then westward again across the Pacific to the Moluccas on the route opened by Magellan.</p>
                <p>In July 1525, Emperor Charles V sent out a fleet of seven ships from Spain under Juan Garcia Jofre de Loaysa bound for the Moluccas with two charts of Magellan’s route. Elcano was second in com- mand. Both men died on the voyage in the mid-Pa- cific, and Toribio Alonso de Salazar became captain in the passage through Micronesia. Only Loaysa’s flagship, the Santa Maria de la Victoria, reached Guam in early September 1526 after a terrible jour- ney during which forty men on the ship died.</p>
                <p>The Victoria approached the eastern side of the island. Because of the rough surf and wind on that side, it took the Spaniards two days to anchor. As the Spaniards sought to anchor, Chamorros ap- proached in proas. One man in a proa astounded the Spaniards by welcoming them in fluent Span- ish. It was Gonzalo de Vigo, who had deserted the Trinidad at Maug four years earlier. He had made his way south to Guam and now joined the crew of the Victoria. Apparently pardoned for his desertion, he provided the information about the Marianas that later appeared on the 1544 map of Sebastian</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>Cabot. The map showed the southernmost island— Guam—as Baham.</p>
                <p>The Victoria departed Guam September 10. Be- fore departing, Alonso de Salazar kidnapped eleven Chamorro men to work the water pumps on his leaky ship. The expedition next touched at Mind- anao before reaching Tidore in the Spice Islands in October 1526. There they were attacked by the Por- tuguese. The Victoria was burned, and the survivors holed up in a fort at Tidore to await rescue by a new Spanish expedition.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the politics of empire build- ing had changed substantially after Hernan Cortés crushed the Aztecs in 1521 and established New Spain in Mexico. By 1522, Cortés was constructing ships on Mexico’s west coast at the village of Zaca- tula and was proposing expeditions north and south along the Pacific Coast. In 1526, however, Charles V ordered Cortés to send a third Spanish probe into the Pacific to search for Magellan’s lost Trinidad and for the missing Loaysa, this time from Mexico’s west coast to the Moluccas via Guam. Three ships constructed at the Mexican town of Zacatula left the nearby harbor of Zihuatanejo on All Souls’ Day in 1527 under the command of Alvaro de Saavedra Ceron in the leaky flagship Florida. They sailed for Guam but drifted south of Magellan’s route. Only the Florida reached Guam. The other ships disap- peared, probably wrecked on the dangerous atolls in Micronesia of what would later be called the Marshall Islands.</p>
                <p>Saavedra, like Loaysa, approached the Marianas farther south than Magellan and sighted the east- ern side of Guam on December 29, 1527. He could not anchor and laid off the island to take on provi- sions from Chamorros in proas. Saavedra continued on to land temporarily on Mindanao before finally reaching the Spice Islands, where he died in 1529. The ship and crew were eventually seized by the Portuguese, who by then were consolidating their control over all the Moluccas.</p>
                <p>Neither the Loaysa expedition nor that of Saave- dra accomplished their missions. The Spanish goals were to trade for spices, spread the faith, rescue sur- vivors of the preceding Spanish probes, and estab-</p>
                <p>ALIENS 1521-1638</p>
                <p>lish Spanish authority in the Spice Islands. Instead, by 1528 the Portuguese dominated the Moluccan spice trade and held prisoners from all three initial Spanish expeditions into the Pacific.</p>
                <p>These earliest European seafarers in the far Pacif- ic and those who followed them in the next century were tough and courageous men who served their nations well in the face of incredible hardships and constant danger. Usually poor and trained as war- riors, they came “to serve God and the king, and also to get rich,” in the blunt words of Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who fought under Cortés in Mexico. If they survived, they would go home wealthy. Should they die, they had the firm consolation of dying in the faith with hope of salvation.</p>
                <p>Not all Spaniards at the time accepted this ruth- less culture of conquest. The most famous critic, Fa- ther Bartolomé de Las Casas, a Spanish Dominican, preached and wrote for many years until his death in 1566 in protest against Spain’s treatment of In- dians. Another Dominican, Francisco de Vitoria (1486-1546), a well-known professor of theology at the University of Salamanca in Spain whose work represented an early formulation of what would be- come international law, wrote that indios had rights under “the rules of international law...they who violate these international rules, whether in peace or in war, commit a mortal sin.”</p>
                <p>The king of Spain, however, was more concerned with geopolitics than with the state of his soul. Frus- trated by the failure of his Pacific efforts and preoc- cupied with European imperial politics, Charles V signed the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 with King John II of Portugal. The agreement defined the pope’s line of demarcation in the Moluccas in favor of Portugal. Charles V renounced all Spanish claims to the Spice Islands and to most of the remainder of Indonesia. In return, he received from the Por- tuguese 350,000 gold ducats and, as it would turn out, enough of the Western Pacific for Spain later to claim the Philippines and the islands of Micronesia, including Guam.</p>
                <p>There was a pause in Spanish efforts in the Pacific between the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 and the</p>
                <p>13</p>
                <p>next official probe westward in 1542 by Ruy Lopez de Villalobos on a large expedition of six ships con- structed in Mexico. Instead of stopping on Guam, he stumbled across several more southerly island groups in Micronesia, probably the Marshalls, Fais, and Yap. The expedition disintegrated in the Philip- pines and the Moluccas, and the remnants of the crews were captured in 1545 by the alert Portuguese in Tidore. Lopez de Villalobos died in Ambon in 1546.</p>
                <p>Villalobos did accomplish one thing of note: he named the Philippine Islands (they were formerly called the Islands of the West by the Spaniards). Villalobos formally named part of them Filipinas in honor of the royal heir who would become Fe- lipe (Philip) I, king from 1556 to 1598 during the high tide of Spain’s imperial power. Members of the Villalobos expedition who made it back to Spain reported the name, which appeared on a map by Abraham Ortelius of Antwerp in 1589.</p>
                <p>After Villalobos’ failure, the Spanish authorities waited over a decade before trying again to cross the Pacific. During that time, the prices of cloves and other spices, particularly pepper, rose to new heights in Europe, where fine dining was being de- veloped during the Renaissance. So, when Philip II became king, he decided to open his own source of spices in the Philippines. The Spaniards mistakenly thought cloves grew there. In fact, only a limited supply of cinnamon grew in Mindanao.</p>
                <p>In 1559, Philip Il ordered the second viceroy of New Spain to colonize the islands that bore the king’s name and to establish a spice trade there. It took five years to construct the ships in Mexico be- fore a fleet of four square-rigged naos sailed from Puerto de la Navidad north of Acapulco under the command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, a prosper- ous middle-aged landowner from Mexico City. With him on the flagship San Pedro as adviser-nav- igator was his friend and Basque kinsman, and by then a friar (fray in Spanish, sometimes translated as “brother”) in the Augustinian Recollect religious or- der, Andrés de Urdaneta, who had sailed with Loay- sa nearly forty years earlier. The other ships were the San Pablo, the San Juan, and the San Lucas.</p>
                <p>14</p>
                <p>The king’s instructions to Legazpi with respect to the Mariana Islands specifically charged him to “se- lect sites and locations for colonization...[but] not occupy or take possession of any private property of the Indians.” The expedition was essentially New World in composition (i.e., mostly criollos—Span- iards born outside Spain), the first of many with little direct participation by Spaniards born in Spain (peninsulares). Mestizos (people of Spanish and In- dian origin) and mulattoes (people of Negro and Spanish or other ethnicity) were recruited, but New World Indians were not because they were consid- ered by the Spaniards as unreliable at that time.</p>
                <p>During the passage to Guam, one ship—the San Lucas—under Alonso de Arellano, deserted the fleet, although Arellano later claimed to have been lost. The San Lucas missed Guam but stopped at Truk and Pulap in the Caroline Islands before reaching the Philippines. Arellano then turned back, sailed north of the Marianas, and crossed the north- ern Pacific to land at Mexico in August 1565 ahead of Legazpi’s return ship. The San Lucas was there- fore the first ship to complete the round trip the gal- leons would later follow between Mexico and the Philippines.</p>
                <p>While the San Lucas was off on its own, Le- gazpi’s main contingent reached Guam on January 21, 1565. The three ships approached Guam from a more southeasterly direction than had Magellan and sailed around the tiny island of Cocos, “full of palm trees,” on Guam’s southwestern tip after sun- set. The ships tacked off the strange shore during the night and prepared to anchor the next morning.</p>
                <p>Sunrise revealed to the Spaniards the lovely little bay of Umatac. It was free of a barrier reef and nes- tled between high grassy ridges along a small river leading back several miles into a deep jungle-filled valley. They could see a large canoe house and some huts near the rocky little estuary of the river outlet. The bay is only a quarter of a mile wide at the en- trance and a third of a mile deep, so Legazpi’s larger two ships, and later Spanish galleons, anchored just outside the bay.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, over 400 Chamorro proas collected about the alien ships. From one of the proas an old</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>man called out, “Gonzalo, Gonzalo.” The Chamor- ro remembered the name of Gonzalo de Vigo, which confirmed to Urdaneta that they were on Guam. Hernando de Riquel, the expedition’s official no- tary, described in his account of the voyage how the Chamorros began to trade briskly with the Span- iards, who soon learned to be wary. After a deal was struck by sign language, the Chamorros would ask that the agreed payment in the form of iron items, mainly nails, be lowered from the ships. Then they sent up baskets and large calabashes with rice and fruits.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards soon found that, below the layer of produce, the bottoms of the baskets were filled with sand and stones. The Chamorros also offered gourds filled with coconut oil, but below the oil, which floated on the surface, was seawater. The Chamorros merely laughed when caught; their view of trade was one of “buyer beware.” They were no more in awe of Legazpi’s men than they had been of Magellan’s.</p>
                <p>As with Magellan, the Chamorros made off with a ship’s skiff, but this time the theft did not provoke a fight. Over the next few days skirmishes broke out repeatedly between Spanish soldiers and Chamorro warriors but were settled quickly as the Spaniards filled water casks and obtained provisions. Legazpi himself went ashore six days after his ships had an- chored. Riquel described how Legazpi took a sword and cut branches of trees and “caused some crosses to be placed on trees, that is, some coconut palms.” A mass was celebrated on the shore. Legazpi then formally claimed the islands in the name of Philip II of Spain. Riquel wrote out and notarized the of- ficial affirmation that Legazpi “occupied and took possession” of the island on January 26, 1565. In actuality, the Spaniards would neither “occupy” the islands nor take “possession” of them for another century, although all the European nations recog- nized Spain’s claim to the islands.</p>
                <p>The fights with Chamorro warriors became seri- ous on February 1, when a Spanish cabin boy was inadvertently left behind by a shore party. When the Spaniards heard shouts from shore and soldiers went back for the boy, they found him dead on the</p>
                <p>ALIENS 1521-1638</p>
                <p>beach. He had been tied to a cross, stripped, killed by spears, his face skinned, and a stake driven into his mouth. Nearby a group of Chamorro warriors jeered at the angry Spaniards and waved the boy’s clothes before being scattered by the soldiers. Mean- while other Chamorros in proas continued trading with the Spaniards as if nothing was occurring. Calm indifference by some islanders alongside vio- lent actions by others would be observed repeatedly in later years by visitors to Guam. This paradox may have been due to separate clans being involved simultaneously with the Spaniards, with each clan concerned only with its own affairs.</p>
                <p>In retaliation for the cabin boy’s death, Legazpi sent his tough military commander, Captain Mateo de Saz, ashore the next day with soldiers to punish the Chamorros. Mateo set up an ambush near the deserted village and then set fire to the Chamorros’ prized proas before simulating a return to the ships. When some Chamorro men hastily returned to put out the fires, three who were wounded and one oth- er were captured by the soldiers hidden in ambush. Mateo promptly hanged the three wounded men from a tree near where the cabin boy was killed. As the soldiers were about to hang the fourth Chamor- ro, Spanish friars interceded and stopped the execu- tion. In later years, Chamorros would often experi- ence what was to them a curious contradiction in Spanish behavior: the vindictive cruelty of soldiers alongside the merciful forgiveness of the priests.</p>
                <p>Following this tragic repetition of Magellan’s sce- nario on Guam, Legazpi’s ships weighed anchor the next morning, February 3, 1565, and departed to the west-southwest. Ten days later, they reached the Philippines, where Legazpi would succeed in estab- lishing the first Spanish colony in Asia and the Pa- cific. The Europeans had come to stay permanently in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>One of Legazpi’s legacies in the Marianas was the first recorded use of names that were antecedents of what would evolve into the word Guam. Documents of the Legazpi expedition refer variously to Goam and Guan as the name of the island in the language of the Chamorros. By the early eighteenth century,</p>
                <p>15</p>
                <p>the name had evolved into Guahan. In his 1806 his- tory of early voyages in the Pacific, James Burney consistently used Guahan as the island’s name. In the 1870s and 1880s, the Spanish governors used the similiar title Guajan. Finally, the Americans would officially designate the island as Guam in 1908, over 300 years after Legazpi’s landfall.</p>
                <p>After he set up a base at Cebu, Legazpi’s most ur- gent task was to establish a return route to Mexico. In June 1565, Legazpi sent the San Pedro, his fast- est ship, back to Mexico with his seventeen-year-old grandson Felipe de Salcedo as captain, Urdaneta as adviser-pilot, and Esteban Rodriguez as pilot. Un- der Urdaneta’s guidance, the San Pedro sailed on a northeast track until well above the Marianas at 39° N latitude. Then Urdaneta had the ship turn east across the north Pacific on about a Tokyo-San Francisco latitude propelled by what is now called the Kuroshio Current, sailing hundreds of miles north of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
                <p>Finally, on September 18, over three months after departing Cebu, the San Pedro reached California and sailed south to arrive at Acapulco on October 8, 1565. Sixteen of the forty-four-man crew died en route, including Esteban Rodriguez, and four more died after arrival. One of these was a Chamorro, the first to reach the New World, sent by Legazpi with three Filipinos from Cebu. The Chamorro had ap- parently been abducted when Legazpi had claimed the Marianas nine months earlier. Urdaneta had succeeded where Espinosa, Loaysa, Saavedra, Vil- lalobos, and others had failed. The San Pedro deliv- ered the first cargo of Asian products to Mexico by way of the Pacific.</p>
                <p>Urdaneta returned to Spain to report on the Phil- ippines venture and, collecting all the new naviga- tional data on winds, courses, currents, and land- marks, put all such information on a map of the Pacific. Versions of this map, held secret for decades by the Spaniards and updated periodically, stan- dardized the galleon route as a great circular loop around the Pacific north of the equator. Urdaneta fixed the Marianas as a useful landmark and stop- over on the trans-Pacific trade route. The Hawaiian Islands, in contrast, were isolated by hundreds of</p>
                <p>16</p>
                <p>miles near the center of the galleon loop around the Pacific and therefore remained unseen by Europe- ans for more than 200 years until the English ex- plorer Captain James Cook reached them in 1778.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros’ next experience with aliens was with the return ship from Mexico to resupply Legazpi’s new Philippine outpost. The viceroy of New Spain in Mexico sent the San Geronimo under Captain Pedro Sanchez Pericon in May 1566 from Acapulco to carry soldiers, supplies, and ammuni- tion to Legazpi, who was under attack by the Por- tuguese. Salcedo remained in Mexico to await Ur- daneta’s return from Spain and to prepare the San Pedro and San Lucas for return to the Philippines in 1567. The voyage of the San Ger6dnimo to the Philippines turned into a deadly melodrama of sev- eral murders, including that of Sanchez Peric6n, and the marooning of mutinous crew members in the Marshalls before the ship reached Rota in August 1566. On Rota, the undisciplined Spanish soldiers killed a number of Chamorros and burned numer- ous houses before the ship hastily departed to reach Cebti in October.</p>
                <p>In August of the next year, Salcedo returned to the Philippines from Acapulco with the San Pedro and the San Lucas loaded with supplies, artillery, and soldiers to reinforce Legazpi at Cebti against the Portuguese. It is not known if Salcedo stopped at the Marianas on his way to Cebt from Acapul- co. A year later, in June 1568, Legazpi dispatched back to Acapulco the San Pablo loaded with Chi- nese silk and porcelain and twenty tons of cinna- mon, again under the command of Salcedo. Legaz- pi ordered the San Pablo to stop first at Guam to see if cloves or pepper grew on the island (they did not; only wild ginger was plentiful). At Guam, the San Pablo dragged anchor when a storm rose at night. The ship was smashed against a reef on Au- gust 15, 1568, at an unknown location, probably near Umatac. It was the first of many Spanish ships to be splintered on the coral reefs of the Mariana Islands.</p>
                <p>Chamorros attacked the survivors but later treat- ed them with kindness. The survivors saved a ship’s launch and constructed a bark from the remains</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>of the wrecked San Pablo. They then managed the remarkable feat of sailing with all the survivors, numbering 132 people, over 1,500 miles back to the Philippines in the makeshift bark.</p>
                <p>The persistent Salcedo set out again from the Phil- ippines in July 1569 on the San Lucas and finally reached Mexico late that year. Thereafter, the trans- Pacific route for the galleons was an established fact in the empire of Spain. From the viewpoint of Euro- pean colonial politics, the Pacific Ocean, except for the East Indies region, became a gigantic Spanish</p>
                <p>lake.</p>
                <p>Galleons, Pirates, and Priests</p>
                <p>By the time Legazpi died in 1572, the Spanish con- quest of the Philippines was nearly complete. Le- gazpi made Manila the entrepdt of Spain’s colony in Asia. Manila’s role was to trade the New World’s silver, carried by the galleons from Acapulco, for luxuries brought to Manila by merchants from China and other lands of the Orient. Few products of the Philippines themselves were shipped to Spain in the early decades of the galleon trade. More and more Chinese merchant fleets arrived in Manila by May each year with goods for the galleons. By 1596, there were thousands of Chinese, called Sang- leys (from sengli, a Chinese term for trade) by the Spaniards, living in Manila. They became so intru- sive that the Spaniards expelled 12,000 of them that year. They would nonetheless drift back to become again a sizable minority in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Each year in May or June, the accumulated ori- ental luxuries in the warehouses of Manila were crammed aboard the great fat galleons at Cavite on Manila Bay for shipment over the northern Pacific route to Acapulco and then across Mexico and the Atlantic to Spain. In the geopolitics of European imperialism, the alternative route from Manila to Spain southward through the Straits of Malacca, then westward across the Indian Ocean and around Africa, was blocked to the Spaniards by Portuguese rights under the Treaties of Tordesillas and Zara- goza and then by the Dutch, who displaced the Portuguese.</p>

                <p>The Manila galleons—loaded with oriental luxuries—sailed from Cavite (Manila’s port) in June or July with the mon- soon winds out of the southwest and took a northeastern track to the north of the Marianas. Avoiding the hostile Japa- nese islands, the galleons then turned eastward with the Kuroshio Current across the north Pacific to reach California, where they turned south to arrive in Acapulco around December after a journey of nearly 3,000 miles. From Acapulco the cargoes went to Mexico City, Havana, and Spain. The same ships, now called Acapulco galleons and loaded with passengers, mail, supplies, and silver for Guam and Manila, normally departed westward in March or April to catch the northeast trade winds along the 14° N latitude. The Acapulco galleons usually touched at Guam or Rota in May or June before reaching Cavite a week or so later. As a consequence of Spain’s colonies and the great circular route of the galleons, the Pacific Ocean came to be considered by the Europeans an exclusive “Spanish Lake” for over 200 years.</p>
                <p>The eastbound galleons, called naos de Manila by the Spaniards, normally set sail from Cavite with formal prayers and ceremony in June or July with the monsoon winds out of the southwest. The ponderous naos wallowed for five or more tedious but dangerous months across the chilly northern Pacific. At Acapulco, much of the cargo was sold through a trade fair timed for the galleons’ arriv-</p>
                <p>al. The ships were then loaded with silver (usually Mexican pesos or reales coins, eight of which were cut from a peso, creating the term “pieces of eight”) and Spanish and New World products to pay for the trade accounts in Manila. They also took on soldiers, merchants, missionaries, and government officials along with mail and supplies. These naos de Acapulco usually departed in March to catch the</p>
                <p>18</p>
                <p>northeast trade winds back across the central Pa- cific on a steady track that passed far south of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
                <p>In the Spanish galleon crossings, and in the Por- tuguese spice trade with the Moluccas, the Europe- ans avoided Melanesia and Polynesia after the dis- appointing results of several expeditions into those areas. Of these, only the indomitable Pedro Fernan- dez de Quirés, pilot of the tragic second Alvaro de Mendafia expedition of 1596 under the command of Mendana’s widow, touched at Guam. There his crew killed two Chamorros “by an arquebus, owing to a matter of a piece of cask hoop.” Iron was still worth dying for among Pacific islanders seventy- five years after Magellan’s crossing.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards also bypassed the islands of Mi- cronesia to the south of the Marianas. Mostly atolls surrounded by dangerous reefs, these south- erly island groups of Micronesia had few natural resources, and their populations were too small to attract sustained Spanish missionary efforts. Therefore, all the traditional Micronesian societ- ies except that of the Chamorros in the Marianas escaped the full brunt of European civilization for nearly 300 more years until the nineteenth century, when whalers, traders, and missionaries would in- vade the region.</p>
                <p>Even the Chamorros were largely spared for an- other century and a half after the intrusions of Ma- gellan and Legazpi on Guam. The eastbound naos de Manila, still well provisioned the first weeks out of the Philippines, swung north of the Marianas. The westbound naos de Acapulco usually passed through the Rota Channel between Guam and Rota just as did Magellan. The biggest galleons often did not anchor, just slowed with furled sails near one of the two islands, not inside the bays where maneuver room was limited. They took on provisions from Chamorros who flocked in proas to trade for iron and other metals.</p>
                <p>The presence of Spanish galleons laden with trea- sures on isolated sea lanes inevitably aroused the attention of Spain’s enemies, and it was not long be- fore privateers arrived in the Pacific. Privateers were ships owned privately but commissioned by their</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>governments to attack enemy merchantmen. The first English privateer to reach Guam, Thomas Cav- endish, arrived in January 1588 on his appropri- ately named ship, Desire. Cavendish did not anchor but “passed near the Isle of Guahan” and took on food and water from the proas that surrounded the Desire. When the persistent Chamorros followed the ship as it departed, Cavendish peevishly raked the proas with musket fire. He sailed on to the Phil- ippines and Java on the way to present his plunder to Queen Elizabeth I in 1588, the landmark year of the defeat of the Spanish Armada by England and the beginning of Spain’s long, slow decline in impe- rial power.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the priests of Spain, with the deep re- ligious zeal of sixteenth-century Christians, became interested in the pagan Chamorros. Catholic interest in the Marianas was an outgrowth of the church’s rapid conversion of the Philippines. With able lead- ers and sound politics, Catholicism prospered in the Philippines even when Spanish trans-Pacific trade later declined. Manila became known as the Alma- cén de Fe (the Warehouse of the Faith) for conver- sion of infidels in the surrounding regions.</p>
                <p>It was Franciscan Discalced (shoeless; they wore sandals) friars who impulsively and without permis- sion undertook the initial missionary efforts in the Marianas. The first was Friar Antonio de los An- geles, who in 1596 was aboard the San Pablo with twenty-two other Franciscans en route to assign- ments in the Philippines. When the galleon came to a halt in the Marianas, probably off Rota, Friar An- tonio asked permission of his superior on board to stay in the islands, and the superior casually agreed, thinking the friar was joking. Soon afterward, An- tonio dropped into a proa alongside and signaled the Chamorros to take him ashore. He had only his crucifix and breviary. As he sailed away in the proa, two Spanish crewmen jumped into another proa to bring him back. All three Spaniards were marooned when the galleon had to depart.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the three Spaniards were picked up the following year by the next galleon and taken to the Philippines. There, Antonio de los Angeles wrote an account of his yearlong stay in the Marianas. He</p>

                <p>Chamorros trading with an Acapulco galleon, 1590. The ship is probably the San Pablo as seen from the flagship Santiago on the stopover in the Marianas in May 1590 of Gomez Pérez Dasmarifias, governor-general of the Philip- pines, 1590-1593. The drawing was likely made in Manila by a Chinese artist employed by the Spaniards to illustrate a chronicle attributed to GOmez Pérez, Relacién de las yslas de los Ladrones (now called the Boxer Codex), about the 1590 crossing. The Spaniards did not permit the Chamorro men to board their ships (women were welcomed) but sent down barter items, usually bundles of nails, on lines to the Chamorros in proas. In return the Chamorros sent up fruit, fish, and gourds filled with water or coconut oil. (Boxer Codex by permission of Professor C. R. Boxer)</p>
                <p>was the first Christian missionary in Micronesia. Others would follow him with even greater zeal.</p>
                <p>Other European intrusions on Guam in this pe- riod were not by Spaniards or the English but by the Dutch. Having gained their independence from Spain in 1579, by the turn of the century the Dutch were replacing the Portuguese in the Spice Islands and challenging Spain for Asian trade. The first Dutch ships to touch at Guam were the Hoop and the Liefde, originally under the command of Jacob Mahu, who died before the ships reached the Straits of Magellan. The two ships arrived at Guam in Feb- ruary 1600 and were subsequently wrecked in Ja- pan. The next Dutch ships to visit the central Pacific also came in 1600 from around South America and</p>
                <p>would proceed on around the world to the Nether- lands in 1601. Under the command of Oliver van Noort in his flagship Mauritius, the Dutch flotilla of two ships spent September 15-16, 1600, at Guam, bartering iron nails for provisions before sailing off to do battle against the Spaniards under Antonio de Morga in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Later, Dutch visitors to Guam included Joris van Speilbergen in January 1616. He also commanded the “Nassau Fleet,” which stopped on Guam for seventeen days in January and February 1625. The fleet careened their ships at Umatac Bay, according to the Spanish Jesuit historian Francisco Garcia. The Chamorros sold rice to the Dutchmen in bales of seventy to eighty pounds each but included sand and rocks in the bottoms of the bales. The Nassau</p>
                <p>20</p>
                <p>Fleet, with over 1,200 men on eleven ships, includ- ing one captured Spanish ship, was the most formi- dable alien presence yet to appear in the Marianas. It was an intimidating omen of the future for the Chamorro people.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Spaniards had continued to make landfalls in the Marianas in between the Dutch expeditions. In 1601, after being disabled by a typhoon, the Manila galleon Santa Margarita sank off a northwest reef of Rota. Only a few dozen of the 300 people aboard survived, and some were rescued in 1602, when a fleet of five Spanish ships arrived at Rota from Acapulco. Aboard one of the Acapulco ships was an energetic and perhaps overly zealous friar, Juan Pobre de Zamora, who was lead- ing a group of thirty Franciscan missionaries whom he had recruited in Spain.</p>
                <p>While the ships were surrounded by Chamorro proas, Juan Pobre and another friar, Pedro de Tala- vera, jumped into proas alongside their ship. They signaled that they wanted to be taken to shore, and the obliging Chamorros complied. The new gover- nor-general of the Philippines, Don Pedro Bravo de Acufia, was with the fleet. He later wrote of the in- cident to King Philip I, saying that the Chamorro proas were too swift to be caught by the Spaniards, and there was “nothing to do but entrust him [Juan Pobre] to some of the leaders among the indios.”</p>
                <p>The two friars remained on Rota for seven months until October 1602, when the Manila galleon Jesus Maria, which had sailed from Cavite too late in the season and had to put into Rota in distress, took Juan Pobre aboard. In gratitude that the friar was safe and sound, the Spanish officers presented gifts to the Chamorro headman who had been the friar’s protector. The headman, whom Juan Pobre referred to as his “master,” was the first Chamorro to have his name recorded in Spanish accounts. He was Su- nama, from the village of Tazga on Rota.</p>
                <p>While this reunion was taking place, the wind shifted, and the ship had to depart immediately for the Philippines. The captain kept the zealous Juan Pobre aboard, but in the hasty departure the other friar, Pedro de Talavera, was left behind along with another unfortunate Franciscan who earlier had wandered off from the Jesus Maria to find Juan Po-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>bre and who had become lost. The two stranded fri- ars were picked up by the next galleon in 1603, along with a soldier remaining from the Santa Margarita survivors. Juan Pobre wrote a detailed and sympa- thetic account of Chamorro customs. His description showed that, as of 1602, eighty-one years after Ma- gellan’s landfall on Guam, the Chamorros had not yet been drastically changed by European contact.</p>
                <p>For the next sixty-six years, the galleons from Acapulco continued to pause about once a year off Guam or Rota. This calm pattern was disturbed in September 1638, when a mutiny occurred on the huge, 2,000-ton, heavily laden Manila gal- leon Nuestra Senora de la Concepcién when it ap- proached the Marianas. As several factions among the crew fought each other, the unattended galleon broached and the masts broke, carrying the sails off into the sea.</p>
                <p>Helpless, the great ship smashed into the reef at Agingan Bay on the southwest tip of Saipan. Many of the 400 or so crew and passengers were likely drowned in the wreck. Chamorros then killed most of the remaining people aboard and looted the gal- leon, keeping gold jewelry as well as any object of iron. Some twenty-eight Spaniards and an un- known number of non-Spaniards survived, accord- ing to a report of the disaster: “Those who escaped went from island to island to those of Uan [Guam| and Harpana [Rota]... where they have been well treated.”</p>
                <p>Six of the survivors, including the pilot, Esteban Ramos, and Juan de Montoya, the ship’s captain, sailed in two proas to the Philippines with two Chamorros provided by a young headman named Quipuha on Guam. The voyagers arrived in the Philippines in 1640, almost dead from the arduous 1,500-mile voyage, while a few of the remaining Spaniards in the Marianas were apparently picked up by galleons in subsequent years.</p>
                <p>Some of the shipwrecked Concepcién Filipinos and Spaniards never left the Marianas; marooned for life, they married Chamorros and raised fami- lies. Spanish historians wrote that the Tinian head- man Taga was baptized by one of the Concepcioén’s Spaniards after the Virgin Mary made a miraculous appearance before Taga on Tinian. According to</p>

Rats had ap- parently come ashore already from earlier European visits. Chickens were brought later, after the galleon trade was established. Chamorros later told Span- iards that the European ships even brought flies and mosquitos to the islands.</p>
                <p>As a result of Chamorro aggressiveness, the Spaniards kept largely to their galleons when they paused briefly in the Marianas. The traditional way of life for the Chamorros continued with only</p>

The precontact culture of the Cha- morros and the natural ecosystem of the Mariana Islands prior to invasion by the Spaniards in 1668 are worth examining in their own right, for after that year the people and the fauna of Guam and the other Mariana Islands would change as the islands became part of the larger outside world. Neverthe- less, in this transition the cultural roots and the genes of the Chamorro people would prove to be remarkably durable in the face of formidable alien invasions over the next three centuries.</p>

                <p>Tano‘ Tasi: Land of the Sea</p>
                <p>The islands of Palau, Yap, and the Marianas are the tips of an immense submerged mountain range along the eastern rim of the Philippine Sea. This range stretches over 1,400 miles in a great bend from Halmahera Island in the Moluccas of Indone- sia northeastward to the Marianas. From the Mari- anas, the range turns north and disappears before reappearing above the ocean as the tiny Volcano and Bonin Islands. Within this mountain range, the Marianas are high islands of comparatively recent volcanic origin in the long span of earth’s geological time. They are not located over a volcanic hot spot, as is Hawai‘i, but are on the eastern edge of the Pa- cific Northwest tectonic plate in a subduction zone along the rim of the Philippine Sea.</p>
                <p>The slow, grinding subduction of the Pacific Northwest tectonic plate under the smaller Philip- pine plate to the west causes volcanism from the Marianas north through the Bonins to Japan. Ow- ing to this subduction, Guam and the other Mari- anas emerged from the ocean, subsided, and re- emerged an unknown number of times, beginning in the early Cenozoic era. This makes the current surface of Guam fairly young geologically. The in- teraction of the tectonic plates causes many volcanic tremors in the Marianas, with a severely destructive earthquake striking Guam about once a century over the past 300 years. Volcanic eruptions still oc-</p>
                <p>22</p>
                <p>cur every few years in the far northern islands of the Marianas, principally on Pagan.</p>
                <p>The first life in the Marianas undoubtedly came from the sea, such as calcareous algae, coral, pol- yps, mollusks, and crustaceans, which created lay- ers of limestone and reef shelves over millions of years. Subsequently, beginning at least in the Pleis- tocene epoch over 10,000 years before the present (B.P.), living organisms other than sea life appeared in the Marianas.</p>
                <p>During June and July into August of each of those thousands of years, birds, insects, and other wind-borne organisms arrived, primarily from out of Southeast Asia. These organisms had started to evolve when Indonesia and the Philippines were still part of the Asian mainland, and were occasion- ally carried away by the southwest monsoons and swept across the Philippine Sea in a northeasterly direction. Among the common Pacific seabirds that made the Marianas their permanent home are the brown booby or gannet, the dark noddy tern, and the beautiful, pure white fairy tern. These all still fly from Guam’s shores to fish miles out to sea, with the tiny fairy terns, usually in pairs, sure signals of fish when the birds wheel and dive from on high as if in aerial dances of delight.</p>
                <p>Migratory birds from Australia and other land masses followed flight patterns over the Marianas</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF BEFORE TIME ANCESTORS 1638-1662</p>
                <p>to the northern Pacific regions. Birds in turn carried seeds they had consumed, depositing some in their droppings on islands in Micronesia. Tiny seeds, pol- len, and spores in the Indonesia-Philippines nexus may also have been carried by convection wind cur- rents and storms up to higher altitudes. There the antitrade winds wafted the living organic particles along with dust eastward in the upper atmosphere of the western Pacific, and some drifted down and landed on the islands of Micronesia.</p>
                <p>Oceanic currents out of Indonesia flow parts of the year as a southwest monsoon toward the north and northeast, carrying water-borne life, notably seeds and swimming animals such as turtles, into western Micronesia. Another oceanic current flows from the northern Philippines generally northward and then eastward into the northern islands of the Marianas, occasionally carrying coconuts, logs, and vegetation rafts with small reptiles and terrestrial invertebrates, mangrove seedlings and other plants, insects, and tiny rodents such as shrews and bats. Combined, the June—July-August southwest monsoon and the oceanic currents dispersed life forms northeastward and eastward out of the Indonesia-Philippines nex- us each year for thousands and thousands of years. Most of those ancient animal and plant travelers perished, but enough—just a few were sufficient out of millions—landed in Palau, Yap, and the Marianas to initiate living communities. Thus, no island was ever a unique biosphere separate from other eco- systems; all were linked by living organisms despite vast distances between them.</p>
                <p>The first humans to enter Micronesia also came mainly out of Southeast Asia; they were proto-Aus- tronesians. By the time they moved beyond what are today northern Indonesia and the southern Philip- pines, they may have already been organized into kinship clans and ethnolinguistic groups of overlap- ping cultures, not just a single, proto-Micronesian or proto-Oceanic people. In hand-carved log ca- noes, and probably with some form of outriggers and square or lateen sails woven of natural fibers, these “boat people” began to sail deliberately or accidentally eastward and northeastward, prob- ably during the June—July-August monsoons, with</p>
                <p>23</p>
                <p>the oceanic currents. The voyages began perhaps 1,700 or more years before Christ (B.C.), that is, at least 3700 B.P. The seafarers likely carried with them food plants and seeds, such as bananas, taro, breadfruit, yams, betel nut, and coconuts. They had knowledge of fire and pottery, were probably expert fishermen, and navigated by the stars, winds, and currents.</p>
                <p>Evidence of human migration out of Southeast Asia to western Micronesia lies in the languages of the Palauans, Yapese, and Chamorros. These lan- guages are different in linguistic origin from the rest of Micronesia to the east. The Chamorro and Pa- lauan languages are separate subfamilies of the ge- neric Austronesian family (formerly called Malayo- Polynesian). They show linguistic affiliations with Indonesian languages in north Sulawesi and with Ilocano and Tagalog in the Philippines, which in turn have links to Taiwan (once part of the Asian mainland). Yapese, in contrast, is an anomaly, a seemingly independent language, although also of Austronesian roots. None of these three western Micronesian languages is a dialect of any other known language, and none was written prior to the arrival of the Europeans.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Micronesia to the east (and of nearly all of Polynesia) is of different geological and linguistic origins than Palau, Yap, and the Mari- anas. The eastern and much of the central parts of Micronesia are composed of numerous tiny atolls that make up today’s Federated States of Micro- nesia (FSM) and the Marshall Islands. Languages there appear closer to Polynesian languages in ori- gin than to Chamorro.</p>
                <p>In addition to linguistic differences from the rest of Micronesia, the Chamorro people appear to be different biologically in origin and in some key physical characteristics, as documented by studies of mitochondrial genetic material (mtDNA) and cranial superstructures of early historic Mariana islanders. The Chamorros have the closest mtDNA similarity to aboriginal Malay groups from western coastal Thailand. This similarity suggests a human settlement history of the Marianas largely separated from and earlier than other Micronesian islands,</p>
                <p>24</p>
                <p>and correlates with the separate linguistic roots of the Chamorro language from eastern Micronesian languages. This does not mean the Chamorros are Malays. The mtDNA affinity indicates the Cha- morros and aboriginal Malays had common mater- nal ancestors (mtDNA is passed through females) thousands of years ago before there were distinctive Chamorro or Malay cultures.</p>
                <p>With respect to cranial superstructures (project- ing outgrowths of bone on the back of skulls de- veloped by prolonged activities such as underwater swimming and canoeing, and perhaps heavy manual labor such as erecting the megalithic latte stone pil- lars of dwellings in the Marianas), one University of Guam anthropologist concludes these “occupation- al markers distinguish ancient Mariana islanders from virtually everyone else in the world.” Chamor- ro prowess as swimmers and divers was noted by a number of early European visitors to the Marianas.</p>
                <p>The distinctiveness of the Chamorro, Palauan, and Yapese languages, genes, and physical charac- teristics from each other and from the rest of Mi- cronesia indicates separate evolutions over a very long time. The northeasterly human migrations out of Southeast Asia halted in the Marianas. Once the islands of the Marianas had been settled by humans, further migrations eastward to the distant Hawai- ian Islands or to the Marshalls were impractical in the face of the implacable trade winds. Beyond the Marianas to the northeast lie only cold, empty seas for thousands of miles until the coast of North America. Furthermore, the southwest monsoon winds generally die out about the time they reach the Marianas, limiting sailing voyages by canoes be- yond those islands.</p>
                <p>Once Micronesia was settled, interisland trade by canoes developed throughout the region, but such trade was conducted principally by low islanders, the atoll dwellers of the central and eastern Caroline Islands. Their small, resource-poor and vulnerable environments tended to impel continuing trade and population shifts with other islands, but the Cha- morros, the Palauans, and the Yapese nonetheless became separated culturally over time from their Southeast Asian roots and from whatever connec-</p>

                <p>Options they may have originally had with each other. Once firmly rooted, each of the western Microne- sian island groups evolved on its own path until the Europeans invaded the islands. The cultures of west- ern Micronesia thus span nearly 4,000 years and could be older, although earlier dates, particularly for Palau’s settlers, have not been substantiated.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of separate development, in the words of one anthropologist, the Chamorros are not a “mixture of Caucasoid and Mongoloid ele- ments—they are simply what they are, from past evolution and drift among local groups.” This view holds that the Chamorro culture and the flora and fauna of the Marianas were adaptive; life and hu- man culture evolved to fit the specific local con- ditions of the Mariana Islands within the oceanic environment that dominates these islands. The Cha- morro language expresses the idea cogently: the Mariana Islands are tano‘ tasi, land of the sea. All life in the islands responded to the winds, waters, and tides that embrace the Marianas.</p>
                <p>A corollary of this view is that Micronesia and certainly the Mariana Islands were not stepping stones in the human colonization of Polynesia, neither to Hawai‘i in the east nor to islands in the southern Pacific. The Marianas became a small world of their own in which the Chamorros were a self-sustaining people, living in a stateless society and in relative harmony with the land and with the sea around them well before the human settlement of Polynesia. The ancient Chamorros developed in a dream-draped world of their own myths, legends, and practicality in the midst of the implacable re- ality of the immense ocean that surrounded them. Because the Chamorro population was probably de- rived from a small number of progenitors, the pre- contact islanders were likely to have been a highly interrelated group with a small pool of genes in comparison to larger continental populations. One consequence of this genetic similarity was to make the Chamorros highly susceptible to infectious dis- eases introduced by Europeans.</p>
                <p>While the people and much of the early flora and fauna of western Micronesia evolved independently from the islanders of eastern Micronesia and Mela-</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF BEFORE TIME ANCESTORS 1638-1662</p>
                <p>nesia, some flora and fauna and human travelers came occasionally from the east. The oceanic cur- rents generally flow westward in central Micronesia and likely dispersed coconuts and other water-borne seeds, insects, vegetation, larval creatures, and some small animals on vegetation rafts from out of east- ern Micronesia and Polynesia to the Marianas. After Polynesia and eastern Micronesia had been settled by humans, these islanders sailed with the westward currents and with the northeast trade winds into western Micronesia for a variety of rea- sons: by accident, for adventure, as exiles, because of population pressures, or in trade and war. These intrusions produced some mixtures in the human cultures and genes, and in the ecosystems already established, but without obliterating their core el- ements. As a consequence, ecosystems and eth- nolinguistic groups throughout Micronesia show likenesses with counterparts in the Polynesian, In- donesian-Philippines, and Melanesian regions. Nonetheless, once introduced to the Micronesian islands, life evolved some unique biological species in the flora and fauna as well as independent lan- guages and biological attributes among the human societies. In this regard, microevolution through natural selection on isolated island ecosystems can be quite swift, shaping new forms in just a few gen- erations. An example is the small Guam reef dam- sel fish, native only to Guam’s reefs. Several plants are indigenous (native or—if they evolved wholly on Guam—endemic) only to the Marianas. Among these are the palmlike federico nut plant, the wild piper shrub, and the magnificent serianthes tree. Indigenous birds include the koko (the flight- less Guam rail), the Marianas crow, the Marianas fruit dove with its iridescent green body and rose- crowned head, and the little black and white Micro- nesian kingfisher. Only one snake is indigenous, but it is tiny, blind, and more like a worm than a ser- pent. There were only a few indigenous land mam- mals other than humans in the Marianas when the Europeans arrived: two species of fruit bat similar to species in Southeast Asia and Melanesia, and a small insectivorous bat. The small bat is now ex- tinct; the fruit bats, called fanihi in modern Cha-</p>
                <p>25</p>
                <p>morro, have become rare owing to loss of habitat to the island’s rapidly expanding human population.</p>
                <p>Although conjectural, the theories presented above of the precontact development of Guam are con- firmed to some degree by artifacts and settlement remains with respect to human cultural linkages. A form of early pottery, called Marianas red ware by archaeologists, was fairly common on Guam by about 3000 B.P. This pottery appears to be similar to a widespread style of early Malaysian red pot- tery and is related to Lapita clay vessels found in an arc from northern Melanesia through parts of Indo- nesia into the Philippines. Lapita pottery is distinc- tive; it was made without a potter’s wheel. By about 800-900 years after the death of Christ (A.D.), plain pottery was abundant in the Marianas. The linkages in shapes and styles between the Lapita- like pottery of the Marianas and the Lapita pottery in the Indonesia-Philippines nexus indicate either parallel human development or contact among the early boat peoples of those areas.</p>
                <p>Among all the central Pacific islanders, only the Chamorros apparently cultivated rice, as was com- mon in Southeast Asia well prior to European con- tact. However, the Chamorros never invented the wheel or the plough, neither of which was partic- ularly useful in a small island precontact environ- ment. Because of the near absence of mammals in the Marianas, the Chamorros never fabricated leather until after cattle were introduced by the Spaniards. In the absence of leather, the islanders developed to a high degree the use of plant fibers for a variety of purposes.</p>
                <p>The absence of ore deposits on the islands prevent- ed metalworking, and none of the precontact Micro- nesians fabricated tools or weapons in bronze, iron, or other metals. One useful Chamorro tool was the short-handled adze with an oval blade made of stone or from the Tridacna gigas clamshell. The form of the adze—called “shouldered” by archaeologists— in the Marianas was similar to those in the Indone- sia-Philippines nexus. Despite assertions by some European writers that Chamorros did not know of fire, the islanders could make fire long before the Eu-</p>

The dispersal of people with Austronesian languages began about 4000 B.C. from the region in or adjacent to South China and spread through Southeastern Asia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Sailing voyages out of northern Indonesia and the southern Philippines from 3500 to 2500 B.C. reached the Marianas, Palau, and Yap. By 2000 B.C., voyagers may have succeeded in settling islands in the central Carolines such as Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae but failed to establish permanent settlements on the atolls of the Marshalls and</p>

                <p>The anthropological evidence to date on the ori- gins of Pacific islanders shows that Micronesia was a highly diverse biological and cultural region cen- turies before Magellan arrived in 1521. Within that diversity, the islanders of the Marianas, or taotao tano‘ (people of this land), as they called themselves in Chamorro, were organized into a stable, unilin- gual society based on the use of stone and shell tools by the time the Romans were conquering the Ibe- rian tribes on the peninsula in Europe that would</p>

                <p>Hypothetical occupation of Micronesia, 2000-1000 B.C. The people in the Marianas and other high islands become fully settled and start to develop separate languages and cultures. By 1500 B.C., atoll dwellers from eastern Micronesia voyaging southward reach islands in eastern Melanesia and form proto-Polynesian settlements in Tonga that eventu- ally move on to form Polynesian cultures in the Cook Islands, the Marquesas, the Society Islands, New Zealand, and</p>
                <p>Hawai‘i by A.D. 1. (Adapted from Howells 1973)</p>
                <p>From early Spanish accounts, the Chamorros, like many other prehistoric cultures, apparently thought that they were the original humans. They referred to their precontact forefathers as “Before Time Ances- tors.” In one of the earliest references to Chamorro myths, Friar Antonio de los Angeles reported dis- approvingly in 1596 that the Chamorros “believe they were born of a rock—whence they go each year for a fiesta.” The rock gave “birth to two men and that one of them had become a woman.” This site has been tentatively identified as Lalas (or Laso‘, pe- nis in Chamorro) Rock, a tall round lava column at Fouha Bay on Guam’s southwestern coast.</p>
                <p>In reality, the first permanent villages on Guam were most likely established by small, separate bands of oceangoing people in the many leeward coastal enclaves where freshwater springs and streams flow out of the higher ground inland. Fish- ing and reef gleaning are easiest from these leeward coastal terraces, where the land and sea interface in protected enclaves. As elsewhere in Oceania, co- conut palms and other trees provided fruit and oil for food in addition to fiber and leaves for sennit ropes, plaited mats, and many other uses by the pre- contact Chamorros. The fruit of the breadfruit tree was a major source of starch, along with taro, yams,</p>
                <p>28</p>
                <p>and bananas, balancing the high protein content of seafood in the Chamorro diet. The seedless and most readily edible variety of breadfruit is infertile and must be cultivated. Since this variety of bread- fruit was present on Guam before the Spaniards arrived, it is probable that young seedling plants were brought to the island by early settlers. The in- ner bark of the breadfruit tree was made into a soft fiber cloth, and the sap provided glue, paint, and caulking for Chamorro canoes. The tall, straight trunks of the breadfruit trees of the seeded variety were chiseled with adzes by the islanders into hulls for canoes.</p>
                <p>As the human population of the Marianas grew, so did subsistence sedentary farming. Food plants included rice, taro, sugar cane, and yams, but not tapioca (also called manioc or cassava). This staple was one of more than 100 plant species introduced to Guam by the Spaniards from the Americas and the Philippines, as were papayas and various hot peppers, which are now eaten at nearly every meal by modern Chamorros.</p>
                <p>Friar Juan Pobre reported in 1602 that Chamor- ros chewed wads made of betel nut of the areca palm wrapped in pepper leaf and powdered with lime obtained by burning coral. This mildly narcotic mixture originated in India and spread throughout Southeast Asia. Chewing betel nut, pugua in Cha- morro, is still popular on Guam, but without the pepper leaf and lime, which stain lips and gums bright red and teeth black.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros produced no intoxicating drinks until tuba (a fermented drink made from coconut palm sap) as well as more powerful alcoholic drinks called aguardiente (“burning water” in Spanish, also called aguayente, or agi for short), usually a liquor distilled from coconut flowers or tuba, and arak (a wine made from coconut juice or rice) were brought to the Marianas from the Philippines. The Spaniards had not known of tuba until it was served to Ma- gellan in the Visayan Islands in 1521. After 1668, the Chamorros learned from Filipino soldiers how to ferment tuba and distill aguardiente, and these drinks became permanently popular in the Marianas.</p>

                <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
                <p>dation of the precontact Chamorro economy. Juan Pobre wrote admiringly, “No better seamen or div- ers have ever been known to exist.” Van Noort’s pilot, Captain Melis, noted in his diary of the 1600 Dutch visit to Guam that Chamorro women “swam as well as the men.” At the age of four or five, Cha- morro boys in the coastal villages were taken be- yond the reef to fish in small-size proas made by their fathers. They trolled for dolphin fish, wahoo, tuna, and marlin, using bone and shell hooks and natural fiber lines. The Pacific blue marlin grows to over 1,000 pounds in the waters of the Mariana Islands. To catch and boat one of these in a sail- ing canoe requires considerable skill, stamina, and courage. Juan Pobre relates how his Chamorro pro- tector, Sunama, handled a large marlin in his proa off Rota in 1602:</p>
                <p>After having eaten the first flyingfish, and after hav- ing baited his hook with the second...a very large blue marlin took the hook....[Sunama’s] line was very thin and...he very cautiously began playing and tiring it.... Meanwhile, a large shark appeared and attacked the blue marlin in the mid-section of its back. In order not to let go of his line, the indio al- lowed his boat to capsize. Then he tied the line to the capsized proa, followed the line through the water to the shark, and diverted him from his catch. Then he brought the blue marlin back to his boat, righted the craft, and sailed home, flying a woven mat as a banner from the masthead.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of a healthy diet and constant exercise, the Chamorros had strong physiques and a pleasing appearance in the eyes of European visi- tors. The Jesuit historian Francisco Garcia, not al- ways a kind commentator, writing in Spain in 1681 from Jesuit reports from Guam for his history of Fa- ther San Vitores published in 1683, described Cha- morros as “a somewhat lighter shade than Filipinos, larger in stature, more corpulent and robust than Europeans, pleasant and with agreeable faces. They are so fat they appear swollen.”</p>
                <p>The swollenness may have been due to the only disease observed by the early Spaniards on Guam: dropsy, or edema, in which fluids beneath the skin and in the lungs caused swelling and other disor-</p>

                <p>ders. Modern archaeological analyses of precontact Chamorro remains also indicate a high incidence of yaws. The Chamorros did not tattoo their bodies, a practice prevalent nearly everywhere else in the Pa- cific. Early visitors to the Marianas noted that the Chamorros took pride in their unadorned bodies and disdained clothing.</p>
                <p>Men and women smeared their bodies with co- conut oil, and Chamorro hair and teeth styles var- ied. On his stopover at Guam in 1588, the privateer Cavendish noted (in Elizabethan English) that the Chamorros had “haire marveilous long; yet some have it made up and tyed with a knot on the crowne and some with two knots.” Women often bleached their hair blonde or flaxen by using lime, as women did elsewhere in Oceania.</p>

Those Spaniards who lived alone among them, like friars Antonio de los Angeles and Juan Pobre de Zamora, considered the islanders to be “loving” and of a “peaceful nature.” Those visitors who traded with them or fought them thought the Chamorros deceit- ful and vengeful. Captain Melis with van Noort in 1600 called Chamorros “subtile deceivers” who cheerfully cheated the Dutch visitors.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros had a different sense of privacy and of personal ownership of possessions or proper- ty than did the Europeans. They shared food, labor, and their own possessions freely and consequently expected the Europeans to do the same. Juan Pobre commented, “Some ties are so close that when one goes to a friend’s house, whether he is at home or</p>
                <p>30</p>
                <p>not, the visitor will take whatever he wants from there, as if it were his own.” Such behavior may be one reason the Spaniards judged the Chamorros to be thieves.</p>
                <p>The characteristics and customs of the Chamorros as described by early European visitors were not strikingly different from those of many other tradi- tional cultures of island peoples of the Pacific. But two developments of precontact Chamorro culture were distinctive: first, the sophistication of their proas—outrigger canoes—and, second, the use of large, uniquely shaped stone pillars, called Jatte in Chamorro, as foundations for their most prominent buildings.</p>
                <p>The distinctiveness of the Chamorro proa was not in its function; beautiful and highly practical canoes were constructed by other island peoples through- out the Pacific. What made the outrigger canoe of the Marianas special was its refinement of form. The asymmetrical shape and weight of the hull and the dimensions, balance, and placement of the sin- gle outrigger and the one triangular lateen sail were among the most sophisticated technically of all sail- ing canoes. Swift, light, and graceful, the proa of the Chamorros was one of the highest state-of-the-art expressions of that most essential instrument of all traditional Pacific islanders, the oceangoing sailing canoe.</p>
                <p>The first Europeans to describe the Chamorro outrigger canoe were Pigafetta and Albo with Ma- gellan. The Genoese pilot with Magellan called it a pardo, a Portuguese word that came to be proa in English. The Spaniards knew of outrigger boats with lateen sails (called sprit sails by Europeans) from Portuguese accounts of the Moluccas and Ma- laysia, where the Malay word for boats was prabhu. All Spanish observers admired the proas as mar- velously nimble. Later European voyagers familiar with canoes in the Pacific held that the Chamorro proa was the swiftest of all such craft, so fast that they were often called “flying proas.” The English master mariner William Dampier, who observed fly- ing proas on Guam in 1686, wrote, “I do believe they sail the best of any boats in the world.”</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
                <p>The Chamorros used different-sized canoes for specific functions. Close to the reef and inside bays they used shallow-draft paddling canoes. For fish- ing and coastal sailing they utilized a standard proa twenty-one to twenty-four feet long with a narrow hull that could hold up to twelve persons. These standard proas were much admired by the Eng- lish privateer Woodes Rogers when he saw them in 1710: “I verily believe they may run 20 miles or more in the time [per hour], for when they viewed our ships, they passed by us like a Bird flying.” For interisland trade or war, or perhaps as headman proas, the Chamorros built larger versions called sakman similar to those still in use in the Caroline Islands today.</p>
                <p>When the Spaniards were subjugating the Mari- anas, they compelled all Chamorros to live on Guam and Rota. Interisland trips, or even sailing beyond the reef, were prohibited without permis- sion of the Spanish authorities. These restrictions were intended to prevent the islanders from flee- ing to the Carolines. As a consequence, the original Chamorro flying proa disappeared by the 1780s. By then, most canoes on Guam reflected Filipino de- signs such as the agaraide, or galaide‘, which were dugouts, often without sails, with arched booms that connected outriggers to hulls, and which were not well suited for long-distance oceanic travel. The Chamorros themselves were by then no longer a people of the open sea, only beach-bound throwers of talaya cast nets and gatherers of nonpelagic fish with seine nets.</p>
                <p>Chamorro latte stones, in contrast, would last on after the Spanish conquest, even though only as ruins in lonely jungle glades throughout the Mari- anas. The /atte were so prominent in the Chamorro culture that archaeologists have divided all precon- tact history of the Marianas into a pre-latte period, which lasted up until between A.D. 800 and 1000, and a Jatte period thereafter, when the Chamorros began to erect the great stone pillars as foundations for their main buildings. The latte period ended abruptly after the arrival of Father San Vitores in 1668.</p>

                <p>interdependent, social stratification became more permanent. Families whose lineages granted them the wealthier coastal areas and knowledge of oce- anic skills such as pelagic fishing and canoe building evolved into the high-ranking clans who erected the latte buildings. Inland people dependent on farming may have become the lower-ranking families.</p>
                <p>Latte were upright stone pillars usually three to sixteen feet high (a few found still in quarries on Rota but never erected were twenty-five feet in length with capstones). They were hewn out of solid limestone or basalt, and each was fixed se- curely in its own separate foundation in a hole with stone supports. Each slab had a hemispheric cap- stone of limestone later called a tasa (Spanish for cup) mounted on top with its curved side down, flat side up, so that it resembled a tall, bulky mush- room with an inverted top. The Jatte pillars for each building were usually aligned in two rows of paired sets. Most buildings had eight or ten Jatte in four or five sets. Heavy coconut fiber ropes lashed around wooden beams and the Jatte caps held the structure together. The sizes and shapes of latte evolved grad- ually from crude, small early forms, sometimes with coral heads as tasas, to smooth, large symmetrical columns by the time the Spaniards arrived. These pillars weathered into distinctive, mottled grey megaliths found nowhere else on earth.</p>
                <p>Members of the Legazpi expedition in 1565 were the first Europeans to describe Chamorro latte structures. The large communal canoe house built on latte at Umatac impressed the Spaniards as a “beautiful structure with four transept naves,” so spacious it could accommodate 200 people along with large canoes. Thirty-seven years later, Juan Po- bre corroborated that description of latte for Rota: “These are the best natives’ houses I have ever seen because they are all built on stone pillars, which others do not have.” The friar had traveled to the Philippines, Japan, and Mexico prior to his stay on Guam and had seen many traditional dwellings.</p>
                <p>The largest Jatte structure in the Marianas was the “House of Taga” on Tinian with columns six- teen feet high, a truly massive megalithic monument whose ruins remain today as a tourist attraction.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
                <p>The latte, like the flying proa, ceased being con- structed or used by the Chamorros after the Spanish conquest. Today, the unique form of these pillars re- mains a motif everywhere on Guam in architecture, logos, and entranceways.</p>
                <p>A Parable of the Tribes</p>
                <p>By the time the Jatte period of Chamorro develop- ment was fully under way several hundred years before Magellan’s arrival, the island’s social strati- fication was already fixed into hereditary clans in each village in control of land and resource rights and with specialized responsibilities. The basic so- cial unit was the extended family, and kinship of relatives was determined primarily through women. The Chamorro mother’s lineage also determined communal property and land rights. These rights extended beyond the shore and included portions of the fringe reefs and fishing rights out to sea. The resources of the sea were not free for all to take, al- though transit access was usually open to everyone. Any outsider who exploited a family’s communal property or resources owed compensation to the family.</p>
                <p>One Chamorro concept not shared by Europe- ans was that knowledge was private property of the clan or family and was not to be given away freely in the public domain or to strangers. Some knowl- edge, such as that concerned with medicine and magic, was held even more secret by a select few. Juan Pobre was offended by Chamorro evasions or lack of response when asked about customs: “Such is the foolishness with which they answer our ques- tions, but they often say we are foolish to ask.” This reticence may account for the reputation of Cha- morros among Spaniards as being deceitful. Pacific islanders today are still often evasive or reply with an answer they assume will be pleasing to alien in- terrogators on family or customary matters.</p>
                <p>Land, reef, and water rights were not exclusive to individuals but were shared by families. This use constituted a form of “managed commons” of resources rather than a primitive communism. Families made up hereditary clans, each usually</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF BEFORE TIME ANCESTORS 1638-1662</p>
                <p>with its own village, whose members were hierar- chically ranked by status. Clans were composed of two kinds of family castes (ascribed groupings into which people were born): one of low status called manachang, or commoners, and a high-ranking one called chamorri. The high and low castes did not normally intermarry and so were not related.</p>
                <p>The chamorri high caste was composed of two flexible classes (differing from castes in that a person’s status could be changed): the matua (or matao), who were the highest class and from whom the clan headman (maga‘lahi) and his wife (maga‘haga) came, and the acha‘ot (or achoti) class, members of whom were sometimes related to the matua but had been banished to be acha‘ot because of some serious infraction of custom.</p>
                <p>The matua and acha‘ot were the ocean fishermen and sailors, and the manachang were primarily in- land farmers. The manachang did not own prop- erty, but they were not slaves to be bought or sold. They were free to seek land-use privileges and so had to be treated well by the chamorri. As in many island cultures before European contact, the rela- tionship of the chamorri elite with the manachang commoners was an unstated compact for common benefit. Juan Pobre described the relationship suc- cinctly: “They do not use slaves to farm the land, in- stead they have criados whom they treat very well. They consider the people who live in the jungles and hills to be of lower status, and they call them magachanes. These, in turn, have great respect for the principales who live on the beaches, so much so that, without permission, they will not go near their houses, nor their funeas, nor their boats.”</p>
                <p>The Spanish word criado that Juan Pobre used can mean a servant or valet raised in a family, and principales—a term the Spaniards applied to all high-ranking Chamorros—refers to the chamorri (funeas were small, inshore proas). The traditional Chamorro social rankings would initially be re- spected, and exploited, by the Spaniards, but even- tually they would be replaced by social rankings de- termined primarily by race.</p>
                <p>When a precontact Chamorro couple married, they lived with or in the village of the groom’s ma-</p>
                <p>33</p>
                <p>ternal uncle (i.e., his mother’s brother) on land of his clan, not with the parents of either spouse or on his wife’s lineage land. Men kept the succession of clan maga‘lahi and control of villages in their hands by having that title go to the maga‘lahi’s brothers or, if none, to his nephews or cousins, not to his son, whose mother was always from a different clan.</p>
                <p>These relationships made marriage a form of po- litical alliance between clans or families of different villages but within the same caste stratifications. A husband was bound to his wife by the bride’s gifts to her father. Such gifts could be substantial and re- quired help from his mother’s clan. If a man lost a wife (and thereby the bride’s gifts) and wanted to marry again, he needed to get help once more from his matrilineage. Owing to property considerations, therefore, a man was under substantial pressure to make a marriage work, but the same pressure was not on a woman. Child rearing was a shared re- sponsibility of the family and clan, enhancing com- munal solidarity.</p>
                <p>In this kind of society, male genealogy did not serve to perpetuate dynasties. Consequently, Cha- morro politics involved constant realignments of kinship ties and endless shifts in the centers of male authority. Such realignments and shifts may be a reason there was neither political unity nor for- mal governmental institutions in the modern sense among the Chamorro clans. Another consequence of a communal matrilineal culture without a cen- tral political hierarchy was that no individual, in- cluding the village headman, assumed or was held to personal responsibility for the failure of any clan or family endeavor. The matrilineal core of their culture may also be a reason why the Chamorros— once they had been militarily defeated—so thor- oughly embraced Spanish Catholicism with its focus on the cult of Mary.</p>
                <p>Many visitors commented on the freedom of women in Chamorro society. Garcia reports, rather disapprovingly, “In the home it is the mother who rules, and her husband does not dare give an order contrary to her wishes, nor punish the children, for she will turn upon him and beat him.” Juan Pobre similarly noted the pecking order: “If the husband</p>
                <p>34</p>
                <p>is unfaithful to his wife...she will leave the house, taking the children and all the household effects... . If the wife is unfaithful to the husband...this sin is con- sidered less serious for the women than for the men.”</p>
                <p>While marriage was a commitment that involved control over wealth, premarital relations where no property was involved were very liberal. A chamorri girl remained with her parents until marriage, but a boy at puberty moved to live in the men’s “big house” (uritao in Chamorro) in the village of his maternal uncle. In the men’s house he was free to have sexual relations with unmarried women, usu- ally from other villages. Illegitimate children were readily accepted into the mother’s family. Chamor- ros were, however, exogamous; they permitted no sexual relations or marriages on the clan side within families.</p>
                <p>In the uritao, a teenage chamorri boy was initi- ated into his uncle’s clan (i.e., his mother’s clan) and learned to fish, to navigate, and to use tools and weapons, particularly lances and slings for throw- ing stones. When a young man married, he left the uritao, and he and his bride moved into a house built by their families in the village of his uritao and maternal uncle. Thus, uncles, not fathers, were the dominant males in Chamorro society. It was also important in property matters as well as for family solidarity to keep close ties among cousins, nieces, and nephews, a custom still strong on Guam today.</p>
                <p>The freedom of unmarried people to have sex was promiscuous and immoral in the eyes of the Span- ish priests. European soldiers and sailors, however, happily took advantage of the custom, but with di- sastrous results for the islanders. An Austrian who visited Guam on a Dutch ship in the 1620s described what happened when Chamorro women came aboard European ships: “They are well-shaped but very wanton because they showed us that we should do prostitution with them, which some of us actu- ally did, but they had to suffer for it and to pay with their deaths.” The suffering and deaths were caused by syphilis and other diseases European men trans- mitted to the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>The complex kinship patterns of the Chamorros were related to their religious beliefs. They vener-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
                <p>ated their ancestors who had bequeathed them their land and lineage. The spirit of one’s own ancestor, called anti, was considered benign if due respect was shown to it. In contrast, the spirit of an ances- tor other than one’s own, called aniti, was feared as potentially dangerous. Chamorros expressed re- spect by preserving an ancestor’s skull as a talisman and by the practice of burying ancestors under Jattes or in front of their houses.</p>
                <p>Also associated with the spirit world was the omi- nous presence of the shaman-sorcerer. The Chamor- ros called them makahnas. Juan Pobre described them: “These macanas have many skulls in their houses.... When the people of the village need wa- ter for their farmlands, they beseech the macanas to make rain.” Chamorro society, however, was not theocratic; the makahnas did not wield formal po- litical power, and Chamorro ancestor spirits appar- ently were never universalized; they remained local clan guardians without a unifying central theology.</p>
                <p>Casters of spells and healers of the sick, the makahnas interceded with dangerous manganiti, spirits of the dead who hid in large trees to guard ancestral lands. Later, under Spanish and American rule, manganiti would still be feared by superstitious Catholic Chamorros as taotaomo‘na, “people of be- fore,” hiding in banyan (nunu) trees. The Chamorro spiritual landscape was also peopled by mischievous elves, later called duendes in Spanish, who lurked in enchanted glades. The makahnas became enemies of the Catholic missionaries in the bloody confron- tations over religion after the arrival of Father San Vitores, and the Spaniards suppressed them ruth- lessly. Vestiges of makahnas, however, continued as kakabnas, sorcerers of black magic who practiced in secret, and as suruhanus (men) and suruhanas (women), folk herb healers who appeared after the Spanish conquest.</p>
                <p>The close family and clan linkages of the precontact Chamorro kinship structure were supplemented by a pervasive custom of mandatory obligations be- tween related and unrelated individuals. The prin- cipal expression of such obligations were (and still are) ika, the giving of gifts or services that obligates</p>

These unique latte megalithic structures of the Chamorro culture were destroyed or fell into disuse during the Spanish conquest of the Marianas in 1668-1698. (Drawing from Morgan 1988)</p>

                <p>the recipient to reciprocate to the giver, and chen- chule‘, gifts without direct obligation for reciproc- ity. Important gifts had to be rewarded either by re- payment in kind or by forming a kinship bond with the giver. Wealthy chamorri could therefore build a network of bonds by giving gifts as well as by ar- ranging marriages. A man’s prestige was measured by the number of people who would come to his aid to reciprocate chenchule‘ when he was in need. Conversely, a man who shirked obligations would not receive aid when he needed it. Forms of these customs, not unusual in premodern societies, were carried over into the present day.</p>
                <p>This giving of gifts for prestige existed in other oceanic cultures and was made possible by an econ- omy one anthropologist aptly described as “sub- sistence affluence.” A man gained prestige not by working and selling what he produced in order to attain a higher material standard of living, but by giving away what his skill produced. That ethos was opposite to the European outlook, particularly the entrepreneurial aggressiveness of Americans. Chen- chule‘ among Chamorros survives today on Guam as a gift, usually money, and also in modified forms of ika, and ayuda, a Spanish term for reciprocal as- sistance, at weddings, fiestas, and wakes and in po- litical loyalty and donations to charities.</p>
                <p>Anyone to whom no reciprocal obligations were owed was a potential enemy to precontact Chamor- ros. A person who had obligations to another but did not fulfill them incurred the enmity of the entire clan of the injured person. Much hostility among the islanders was thus caused by feuds between clans, usually one village fighting another over injuries to individuals. An implication of this was that Span- iards or other foreigners were potential prospects for mutual obligations, but when the aliens refused such obligations, either deliberately or through ig- norance of the custom, they then became potential enemies of the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>Competition and rivalry, as well as the potential for the eruption of warfare, were normal between Chamorros of unrelated villages and with anyone outside the culture. Sports for male youths focused on preparation for warfare, and weapons were car-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 2</p>
                <p>ried for use by Chamorro men among strangers. Ac- tual combat, however, was usually ritualistic. The chief weapons—sling-stones and lances—although dangerous, kept combatants at a healthy distance from each other.</p>
                <p>Chamorro warfare was therefore mainly a cul- tural means to satisfy vengeance and perhaps to test manhood and the strength of alliances among clans, particularly as to land and resource rights. Combat was usually between individuals or small groups, not masses of warriors. Garcia observed, “When they arrive at the moment of battle, peace is quickly arranged, for one side, having lost two or three war- riors, gives up the fight.”</p>
                <p>When the Jesuit missionaries arrived in 1668, Guam’s two largest villages were Agana and Tu- mon. Using information from the San Vitores mis- sion reports, the Jesuit historian Garcia stated that there were over 1,500 people in the area of Agafia, with 53 houses of the chamorri and 150 houses of the manachang when San Vitores arrived. Despite the authority of the chamorri in these two villag- es, neither dominated the island, and there was no overall island chief or a tribal government in the Marianas. Father Martin Ignacio de Loyola, who visited Guam in 1581, wrote “None of these islands has a king or recognized ruler, to whom the rest are subject.” The authority of headmen rarely extended beyond their village’s “immediate vicinity,” accord- ing to Garcia.</p>
                <p>The political autonomy of Chamorro clans from each other did not lend itself to unified political or military efforts to maximize power. If a Chamor- ro was killed by Spaniards, only the members of that Chamorro’s clan were obligated to redress the wrong; other clans would go on dealing with the Spaniards as if little had occurred. In other words, the Chamorro people were never a unified tribe or an ethnic “nation” in a governmental sense. They held no concepts of the need for economic or politi- cal development in European terms or for religious conversion of other peoples. However, the Cha- morro ethos certainly fostered intellectual develop- ment, as evinced by their remarkable proas and latte structures.</p>
                <p>THE PLACE OF BEFORE TIME ANCESTORS 1638-1662</p>
                <p>Like many traditional island cultures, the precon- tact Chamorros lived in vulnerable symbiosis with nature, not in a balance but in an interdependence that imposed limits on the part of human activi- ties. In contrast, the Spanish empire was a power- maximizing system with a national mission stoked by spiritual fervor. Spain was the protector of the Catholic Church, itself a power-maximizing system for universal religious ends. In the Spanish empire, religion, government, and the military were fused into a massive singular under the central control of the Spanish crown in the unlimited pursuit of power to conquer nature, not to compromise with it.</p>
                <p>A central irony of the struggles of the Chamor- ro people against the Europeans is that in order to mount a successful defense, the islanders had to be- come politically like the outsiders. The Spaniards would impose on the decentralized Chamorro clans the need for governmental centralization to defend themselves. One way of looking at this paradox is called the parable of the tribes, in which the concen- tration of political power, once introduced among peoples, will become universal among competing societies. Anthropologists have described the par- able of the tribes as a division between “resilient societies” (which adapt by maintaining population and resource needs below the environmental carry- ing capacity) and “power-based” societies (which adapt by acquiring more territory, resources, and people). The resilient, non-power-based society is found more often among small traditional cultures such as that of the precontact Chamorros, while the power-based kind is found mainly among modern-</p>
                <p>37</p>
                <p>izing Western nation-states such as Spain. The par- able of the tribes as a metaphor can be viewed as ongoing and globalizing in human social develop- ment even when fulfilled in one historical instance or culture.</p>
                <p>One consequence of a power-based society is a growth economy, an ever-expanding materialistic system in competition with its neighbors, with its natural environment, and with its own past. It was this aggressive power system that the Europeans imposed worldwide in their colonial expansion af- ter Columbus, Magellan, and other conquistadores opened up the pathways to lands beyond Europe. Peoples who do not become power maximizing are subsumed by such men and their predatory system.</p>
                <p>The parable of the tribes does not explain all the complexities of clashes between foreigners and na- tives in history. However, the core of the concept— that in those clashes the tide of history runs against traditional societies and absorbs them into colonial stepchildren of power-based societies—appears not only valid in the history of Guam, but continues in the twenty-first century through globalization as a new form of economic and cultural imperialism by the Westernized, most powerful nation-states of the world, particularly in the case of the United States.</p>
                <p>The imperative to centralize authority and maxi- mize power would be imposed on the Chamorros by the arrival on Guam of the Jesuit missionary Di- ego Luis de San Vitores. How the islanders respond- ed to the parable of the tribes as posed by Father San Vitores, backed by the Spanish crown and the church of Rome, would determine the destiny of the Chamorros as a people.</p>

                <p>On a sunlit day in May 1662, the Spanish ship San Damian furled sails and slowed in crystal blue tropical waters as it approached a high, dark green island in the western Pacific. The island was one of the Islas de los Ladrones, as they were still called by Europeans in that period. Which specific island was not recorded, but it was most likely Guam or Rota, where such stopovers were by then routine. The ship, a two-masted brigantine (patache in Span- ish), faster and smaller than a galleon and used to carry supplies, had left Acapulco in April en route to Manila with a contingent of fifteen Jesuit priests bound for assignments in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>No Spanish settlement existed in the Ladrones at the time, so the ship did not anchor but as usual stood offshore from an inlet for a day or so to ob- tain water and fresh food from the islanders who sailed out in their proas. Dozens of these graceful canoes filled with naked Chamorros surrounded the San Damian. The islanders eagerly passed up bas- kets filled with glistening fish, colorful fruits, and other fresh produce in barter for iron and European goods lowered on ropes by the ship’s crew. Cha- morro men were still not allowed on board Span- ish ships because they continued to steal things even after decades of contact with Europeans. This once- a-year arrival of Spanish ships had been going on for nearly three generations of Chamorros by 1662.</p>
                <p>38</p>
                <p>It was important for them as the only way to ob- tain barrel hoops of iron (hiero to the Chamorros, who apparently adopted the word from the Span- ish word hierro) and nails (lulok in Chamorro), on which they now depended to replenish their knife blades, adzes, and fish hooks.</p>
                <p>On deck among the black-robed priests who watched the Chamorros clamor for the hiero and lulok stood the Jesuit superior, a slim thirty-four- year-old Spanish aristocrat, Father Diego Luis de San Vitores. He had the delicate white skin, light reddish-brown hair, and bright blue eyes of a Castil- ian from the city of Burgos in the north of Spain. His eyes were weak from long study of poorly printed religious texts in the dim light of Jesuit classrooms, so he wore eyeglasses. These were still clumsy, large- framed devices in the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>The glasses gave San Vitores an owlish look below his high forehead and over his long curved nose and small dark mustache. He disliked the glasses and later preferred not to wear them on treks through humid jungles. This meant he often had to be led by hand or rope by guides on trails in the Philip- pines and the Marianas. Without the glasses, he was a handsome man in a somber way, usually unsmil- ing and intense.</p>
                <p>The vivid scene with the eager Chamorros in the Ladrones made a deep impression on Father San</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>Vitores. To him, Chamorros were free, untamed pagans, like innocent children, living in an unen- lightened state of nature. Like friars Antonio de los Angeles and Juan Pobre de Zamora before him, San Vitores felt an overwhelming responsibility to save these foresaken souls despite—or perhaps because of—their neglect by the Spanish authorities.</p>
                <p>Acapulco was too distant to support a Spanish settlement in the Ladrones, so the authorities in Manila had been authorized several times by Ma- drid over the years to establish a mission on Guam, but they had not done so. Manila’s priority was on the Philippines, where commerce and the demand to convert and serve a population much larger than that of the Ladrones already strained available Spanish resources. With no mission in the islands, San Vitores, as a dutiful Jesuit unlike the more free- spirited Franciscans earlier, sailed on to the Philip- pines when the San Damian departed the Ladrones. However, he never forgot that first soul-stirring sight of pagan Pacific islanders whose salvation he came to identify with his calling as a missionary.</p>
                <p>Before departure, the crew of the San Damian took aboard for transport to Manila an old illiter- ate Visayan Filipino named Esteban Dias (or Diaz in some accounts) who had been aboard the galleon Concepcion wrecked at Saipan in 1638. In his long residence on Guam since the shipwreck, Esteban had become fluent in Chamorro. This shadowy old man would become San Vitores’ Chamorro lan- guage interpreter.</p>
                <p>San Vitores appears to have been destined from childhood to be a missionary in the Society of Jesus, that most disciplined and educated of all religious orders. Born in Burgos on November 12, 1627, he was baptized Diego Jeronimo de San Vitores y Alonso de Maluenda. His father, Jeronimo de San Vitores de la Portilla, was a prominent knight of the Order of Saint James. San Vitores’ mother, the se- vere and haughty Dofia Maria Alonso de Maluenda y Salamanca, was also from one of Burgos’ oldest noble families. She claimed descent from El Cid Campeador, born Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, the great hero-liberator of northern Spain in the eleventh cen-</p>
                <p>39</p>
                <p>tury. Through his parents and relatives, San Vitores had access to the highest court and church circles in the reigns of Philip IV and his widow, Queen Regent Mariana of Austria. These connections to sources of power would be invaluable to San Vitores later in persuading reluctant Spanish officials to establish a mission in the Ladrones.</p>
                <p>After early schooling by Jesuits and despite fam- ily objections, San Vitores was admitted in 1640 at age thirteen as a Jesuit novitiate. He completed the arduous Jesuit studies in 1650 with distinction and in 1651 was ordained a priest in the Compania de Jest, as the Jesuit order was called in Spain. Fol- lowing several more years of study and teaching, he was assigned in 1655 to the faculty of the presti- gious university at Alcala de Henares, normally a lifetime position.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, after recovering from several severe illnesses, he used all the influence he could mus- ter, again overcoming family objections, to be sent abroad as a missionary to fulfill his apostolic vo- cation. Ordered to the Philippines, he sailed from Cadiz in May 1660 to Vera Cruz, Mexico, where nearly a century and a half of harsh Spanish rule had tamed most Indians to docile acceptance of Christianity. The impatient San Vitores was held up for two years before sailing at last in 1662 on the San Damian for the Philippines by way of the Ladrones.</p>
                <p>In the Philippines, San Vitores learned the Taga- log language so quickly he was preaching in it three months after his arrival. Innovative and energetic, he breathed new life into Tagalog parishes through “popular missions” in which he and other priests walked the streets, carrying a crucifix while crying out the Act of Contrition in Tagalog. This was fol- lowed by fervent sermons as a crowd gathered, and led to emotional baptisms. These techniques had great response at the grassroots level.</p>
                <p>Although effective, most of this labor involved parishes where conversions had already been made by earlier missionaries since the arrival of Legazpi a century earlier. This kind of service was not the goal of San Vitores. He wanted to be at the van- guard of evangelical work among true infidels, not</p>
                <p>40</p>
                <p>lapsed Christians. A complex but unswerving man, San Vitores aimed from an early age at conversion of the poor, symbolized in the biblical Latin phrase Evangelizare pauperibus misi te (I have sent you to evangelize the poor), to which he often referred in his letters. And, in his view, the poorest people, both spiritually and materially, he encountered were the Chamorros. In order to return to them, he launched a persistent campaign in the Philippines to open a mission in the Ladrones.</p>
                <p>Establishment of a mission there would entail not only a contingent of Jesuit priests to Christianize the Chamorros, but also Spanish soldiers to protect the missionaries. The Spaniards called such an effort a reduccion to subdue, convert, and gather pagans into Christian congregations. The spiritual reduccion of Indians and the accompanying spread of Spanish secular authority by the military also served Spanish trade. In other words, the cross of the church and the sword of the state supported each other in the complex relationship of the Patronato Real, or royal patronage, granted by the church of Rome through a series of papal bulls in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the Spanish crown whereby Spain gained control over all Catholic missions in the Spanish em- pire. Thus the initial imposition of Western colonial- ism in the Pacific islands was not just for trade and the search for gold and silver, but also for religious and politico-military purposes that led to economic benefits for Spain and the Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>Through the Council of the Indies and the vice- roys, governors, and audiencias (the highest coun- cil/court) in the colonies, the crown provided mate- rial support and security to the church’s missionary efforts. This mutually reinforcing combination of spiritual and temporal powers gave Spain the great- est colonial empire on earth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Therefore, what San Vitores was requesting in the 1660s was not just a minor evangelical effort but a commitment by church and state to a modest but strategically significant exten- sion of the Spanish empire into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>The Jesuit superiors of San Vitores were reluctant to endorse his request but also hesitated to rebuff a person with court connections. So they sent him</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>to the archbishop in Manila, Manuel Poblete, and to the governor-general, Diego Salcedo. Archbishop Poblete supported the request, but Salcedo, backed by the members of the audiencia in Manila, refused. They argued that, no matter how laudable spiritu- ally, a mission in the Ladrones was impractical. The civil authorities were content to let the Ladrones remain as they were, provision points for the Aca- pulco galleons without need for expensive soldiers and supplies.</p>
                <p>By 1664, San Vitores’ quest for a mission among the Chamorros had become an obsession with him. Frustrated by the rebuffs of civil authorities in Ma- nila, he decided to go over their heads and address his plea directly to the court in Spain. In July 1664, he posted a letter to his father, asking him to pres- ent an “enclosed letter” to King Philip IV. The letter was an extraordinary memorandum, titled a Memo- rial in Spanish, written partially in the words of the long-dead Jesuit Saint Francis Xavier and partly in San Vitores’ own words. The Memorial, using the words of Saint Xavier, prophetically warned the king he would soon die and be called to account by God (Philip IV was a notorious libertine, father- ing thirty illegitimate children, but he was also fa- mous for bouts of religious repentance out of fear of God’s vengeance). Emerging with his own voice in the Memorial, San Vitores pointed out to King Philip that his ministers in the Indies were neglect- ing evangelization of infidels and allowing mistreat- ment of converted indios and that a mission should be established in the Ladrones.</p>
                <p>San Vitores then followed up the Memorial by persuading Archbishop Poblete to write a letter in June 1665 directly to Philip in support of a mission on Guam. Two documents were enclosed with the archbishop’s letter: a certificate by the Spanish ad- miral in Manila, Esteban Ramos (who had been the pilot on the Concepcidn and spent several years in the Marianas after the 1638 wreck), on the need for a mission in the Ladrones, and a long paper that presented the “motives for not delaying further the conquest and instruction of the Islands of Thieves.”</p>
                <p>Not content with these messages, San Vitores</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>added insurance to his quest by also writing to the Austrian Father Juan Everardo Nithard, who was Queen Mariana’s Jesuit confessor and thus in a po- sition of influence. San Vitores had met Nithard and knew that a message to him would reach the queen, which it did. San Vitores also knew that Mariana was a deeply religious woman who took personal interest in missionary work, particularly the bap- tism of infidel children. This queen was not timid; when younger, she was known as Coto Dofana be- cause she loved to hunt on horseback in the Coto</p>
                <p>41</p>
                <p>Mariana of Austria. The queen regent of Spain from 1665 to 1677 in whose honor Father San Vitores in 1668 changed the islands’ name bestowed by Magellan in 1521 from “The Islands of Thieves” to “The Mariana Islands.” She is shown in a nun’s habit she wore after the death of her husband, King Philip IV, in 1665. Mariana provided substantial funds and other assistance to the Jesuit mission on Guam. She was im- prisoned in 1677 by her son Charles II so that he could become king; she died in 1696. (Seventeenth-century oil portrait attributed to Claudio Coelle, Prado Museum, Madrid)</p>
                <p>area of southern Spain. Through Nithard, San Vi- tores asked that the queen direct “all her energies to- wards the conversion and reduction of these Islands [the Ladrones] to the faith of Jesus Christ,” and he stressed the need to save the Chamorro children.</p>
                <p>As audacious as San Vitores’ maneuverings may appear, his methods proved correct to circumvent the massive bureaucracy of the Spanish colonial system and to succeed in the murky politics of the court. According to one historian, the last years of Philip IV’s reign found Spain “a shattered Monar-</p>
                <p>42</p>
                <p>chy, itself no more than a pallid relic of the great imperial past.” Direct intervention at any govern- mental level by the sovereigns or their ministers in response to personal appeals by church officials and court favorites was normal. The king and queen re- ceived San Vitores’ messages favorably, and in June 1665 Philip issued two cédulas (royal decrees or edicts), one to the governor-general in Manila that a ship be provided San Vitores and another to San Vitores to establish a mission at Guam. In eerie ful- fillment of San Vitores’ prediction, the king died in September 1665, leaving Mariana regent for their four-year-old heir, the feeble-minded Charles II, for the next eleven years.</p>
                <p>The cédulas took until June 1666 to reach Manila. Annoyed at San Vitores’ pulling strings in Spain, Governor-General Salcedo and the Manila audien- cia nonetheless complied with the royal decrees and ordered that an auxiliary galleon of 300 tons be con- structed in Cavite for the now-elated San Vitores. Salcedo commanded that the ship be named San Di- ego in honor of both himself and the patron saint.</p>
                <p>The zealous Jesuit’s troubles were still not over, however. There was no money authorized for the Guam mission. Therefore, the San Diego was or- dered by the governor-general in Manila to go first all the way to Mexico City, the next higher level in the Spanish colonial system, where San Vitores was somehow to obtain funds before going to Guam. This order greatly pleased the powerful Spanish merchants of Manila, who foresaw commercial profits from San Vitores’ trip. They had earlier pro- posed that the ship go to Peru first, where even more profits could be had, but objections by San Vitores made them drop that project.</p>
                <p>In August 1667, San Vitores and his fellow Jesuit Tomas de Cardefioso sailed in the brand-new San Diego from Cavite, arriving five months later in Acapulco. The Jesuits hurried to Mexico City and requested money of the viceroy, the Marqués de Mancera, and of the audiencia of Mexico, which at that time had jurisdiction over the Philippines. The reply was a flat no: the treasury lacked funds, and Mexico’s viceroy had received no official instruc- tions to give money to Father San Vitores.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>It was during a subsequent conversation of San Vitores with the viceroy and his wife that a coin- cidence occurred that was interpreted as divine in- tervention in favor of the priest. The viceroy was refusing impassioned pleas by both his wife and San Vitores to fund the Guam mission when a power- ful earthquake struck Mexico City. The intimidated viceroy met hastily the next day with the audiencia even though it was Sunday, and they all immediately pledged money to Father San Vitores. Other citizens of the city then donated even more funds, as well as jewels, clothing for the Chamorros, and furnishings for the churches to be built in the Ladrones.</p>
                <p>Three months later, the San Diego departed Aca- pulco with San Vitores and Cardefioso aboard along with other Jesuits, considerable supplies, some Fili- pino catechists, and a complement of soldiers. Just before departure, San Vitores wrote another let- ter to Queen Mariana in which he asked for more money and supplies. The small missionary group also included Esteban Dias, the Filipino survivor of the Concepcion wreck who had been retrieved by the San Damidn in 1662 on Guam. He had been hired by San Vitores in the Philippines to teach him the Chamorro language and was brought along as an interpreter for the Guam mission. San Vitores had started studying Chamorro in the Philippines, where he translated some hymns and prayers. It was during the voyage from Acapulco that he completed in Latin the first rough grammar of the Chamor- ro language and translated the catechism into Cha- morro with the help of Esteban.</p>
                <p>On the morning of June 15, 1668, eighty-nine days out of Acapulco, the welcome cry “jTierra, Tierra!” rang out from a crewman as mass was be- ing said aboard the ship. The flat mesa mountain of Rota showed above the horizon. Soon Guam was sighted, and in the afternoon dozens of proas filled with Chamorros surrounded the San Diego. The is- landers busily commenced the usual barter along- side the ship, happily yelling, “Mauleg! Mauleg!” (Good! Good!) at the black-robed priests on deck. A Jesuit scholastic (student priest), Brother Marcelo Ansaldo, who would continue on to the Philippines with the ship, later described the bartering in a letter</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>to Queen Mariana: “Thirty years ago a ship which carried many little gold chains and many ivory cru- cifixes and other statuettes was wrecked here and many of these statuettes and chains were salvaged. To this day the natives barter those little gold chains or ivory images for iron.” The ship to which Broth- er Ansaldo referred was the Concepcion, wrecked on Saipan in 1638.</p>
                <p>By nightfall, the San Diego was close to shore near a large village, which the Spaniards would make the island capital. The Jesuits at first called the village Agania or Agadna, and then Agafia, which would become Agana in English in 1899 under the U.S. Navy (the Americans dropped the diacritic over the n but still usually pronounced it as “Agafia”). In the 1990s the name would be changed officially to its present form, Hagatfia, when many colonial place- names on Guam were Chamorrized. The San Diego first dropped anchor in sand and slowly dragged an- chor during the night. While this was going on, the Chamorros warily remained in their proas despite the priests’ appeals for them to come aboard the ship, which from the Chamorros’ experience was abnormal behavior for the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>Only after the priests chanted the Litany of Our Lady, ending with words prophetic for the future of the Chamorros, “Sancta Maria: Ora pro nobis” (Holy Mary: Pray for us), did the islanders begin to climb aboard the San Diego. There they were greet- ed in strangely accented Chamorro phrases and em- braced by a gaunt forty-year-old Jesuit who wore a well-worn black cassock and large-framed eyeglass- es. The ship would not anchor firmly until the next day, June 16, 1668, but Father Diego Luis de San Vitores knew he was at last back in the Ladrones after six long years of dedicated effort to return.</p>
                <p>A Mission of Martyrs</p>
                <p>The landing the next day was described by Brother Ansaldo:</p>
                <p>It was God’s will that all was fine, so on Saturday, June 16 at 4:00 p.m. we dropped anchor in front of what seemed to be a bay across from a coconut</p>
                <p>43</p>
                <p>grove.... That afternoon the Pilot, Father Luis de Medina, Superior of the Philippine Mission, and his interpreter, who knew the language well, went ashore. More than 200 men, with spears made out of human shinbones, awaited their arrival. They wanted to know about the ship which had just sailed in. Father Medina and his interpreter told them that the priests had come to stay and would teach them the way to heaven.</p>
                <p>The first Chamorro headman whom Medina’s party met on the beach among the warriors was a man named Fatahurao, to whom the Spaniards gave presents of iron. The presents were well received, and Medina returned to the San Diego for more barrel hoops, nails, and trinkets before once more landing on the beach. The party was then led across a stream to the village of Agafia, whose elderly head- man was Quipuha (Kipuha in Chamorro), a cham- orri noble. Medina gave Quipuha gifts of iron anda velvet hat, “with which he was very pleased,” wrote Garcia. Medina and his companions then spent the night as Quipuha’s guests.</p>
                <p>While Medina’s party was on shore, Father San Vitores was surprised when a Christian Visayan Filipino, Pedro Calonsor, came aboard from Guam. He was a survivor of the wreck of the Concepcion thirty years earlier. Pedro brought aboard his two- year-old half Chamorro daughter. She was promptly baptized and given the baptismal name Mariana. The little girl was apparently the first person on Guam documented to be baptized a Christian. Pe- dro Calonsor became a catechist and trusted com- panion of San Vitores. Another Concepcién survi- vor, a Malabar native called Lorenzo de Morales, also joined the mission as a catechist.</p>
                <p>It was after the baptism of Mariana that Father San Vitores named the archipelago Las Islas Mari- anas in honor of the queen regent. From then on the Spaniards often called Chamorros Marianos as well as indios and nativos. No formal ceremony was noted by Garcia, and in fact, in earlier letters to Spain written in Mexico, San Vitores had called the islands the Marianas in place of Islas de los Ladrones. The new name would be used thereafter by the Spaniards in official references, but the old</p>
                <p>44</p>
                <p>name Ladrones lingered for years because it was on numerous maps.</p>
                <p>San Vitores went ashore for the first time the next day after Medina returned with news that all appeared peaceful. San Vitores was received with much dancing and celebration by the Chamorros. He said his first mass ashore at an altar erected on the beach near some small Chamorro huts that Me- dina had named the Pueblo de Martires in honor of the saints’ day. This prescient title, like many of the new place-names the Spaniards bestowed ev- erywhere in the islands, would later disappear as the old Chamorro names reasserted themselves in modified forms. Remarkably, San Vitores preached his initial sermon on Guam completely in Chamor- ro at this first mass. During the unloading of sup- plies from the ship, Brother Ansaldo recorded one historic little scene: “A moment of intense surprise and interest was when our sailors brought ashore rams, sheep, a little bull, a cow and three parrots which are to stay here. The indios had never seen any of these animals before so they greatly marveled at seeing them.”</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, the San Diego departed for the Phil- ippines, leaving the little mission of approximately fifty men on their own for a year until the next gal- leon would arrive. As the father superior, San Vi- tores was both the spiritual leader and the secular chief executive with control of the soldiers through the military commander, Captain Juan de Santa Cruz. This Filipino captain is sometimes erroneous- ly listed as the first governor in history books, but the title governor would not be used until 1676. The mission consisted of five Jesuit priests, one scho- lastic brother (Lorenzo Bustillo), three Spaniards, and about thirty non-Spaniard laymen. These latter were mostly Filipinos but included some Mexican mestizos of Spanish and Indian descent. About ten of the non-Spaniards were soldiers and the remain- der either catechists or servants.</p>
                <p>This small band of aliens was left to face a popu- lation of perhaps 12,000 Chamorros on the island of Guam and about 8,000 more throughout the Marianas, a total of about 20,000 Chamorros in the year 1668. The population may already have been</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>in decline because of diseases introduced as far back as Legazp1’s visit in 1565.</p>
                <p>In order to convert this many people with only five priests, San Vitores baptized infants, particular- ly those in danger of death, and the elderly in groups without catechizing them and with (or without, if necessary) the parents’ concurrence for children. Adults other than the elderly were baptized after being catechized, often in mass groups. Instruction in religious doctrine was accomplished by the Cha- morros singing in unison after the priests. In accord with the Jesuit practice of Cuius regio, eius religio (As the king, so the religion), the priests endeavored to convert the headmen and other chamorri of each village first as examples for the populace. At the first mass in Agana, San Vitores baptized twenty- three children in one group, and 1,500 adults were “converted” (i.e., they indicated they wished to be- come Christians) to be baptized later after receiving doctrinal instruction.</p>
                <p>Within a few days, San Vitores and a compan- ion set out on an initial reconnaissance of Guam but were soon obliged to return to Agafia at the request of the chamorri there, who were worried that San Vitores might settle in another village. The Cha- morros in Agafia called San Vitores Padre Magas (Father Superior or Big Father). They jealously kept him a virtual prisoner in the village for almost two months. Word about the arrival of the foreigners had spread quickly among the Chamorros through- out the islands. It became a matter of prestige for a village to possess one of these novel new makahnas who handed out iron and other gifts in return for participation in their strange rituals. Rota sent a delegation to Agana to ask that a priest be sent to that island.</p>
                <p>To satisfy this initial wave of enthusiasm by the Chamorros, San Vitores spread his staff throughout the main islands. He and Lorenzo Bustillo remained in Agafia—named San Ignacio de Agafia by San Vi- tores—as the capital of the mission. Father Medina traveled to the other villages on Guam; Father Pe- dro de Casanova went to Rota; and Fathers Tomas de Cardefioso and Luis de Morales sailed by proas to Tinian and later to Saipan. Each priest usually</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>had a Filipino catechist assistant, but the soldiers re- mained stationed at Agafia.</p>
                <p>All went well for the missionaries the first few weeks. Quipuha made land available for a church and a residence. These shedlike buildings (called camarins by the Spaniards) were constructed of local palomaria and coconut logs with thatched palm roofs. The buildings of the first little Spanish mission were probably near the present-day Chief Quipuha Park. The missionaries planted maize, the seeds for which they brought from Mexico, the first corn grown on Guam.</p>
                <p>On his arrival on Rota, Father Casanova baptized more than 300 children. In his first three months on Guam, Father Medina reported he baptized over 3,000 people. The missionaries placed great value on these spiritual body counts, which were reported with pride to church officials and to the queen re- gent in Spain. It would take a later missionary in the Marianas—Father Francisco Salgado—to explain in a letter written in 1683 the exaggerated baptismal figures of the early priests. He wrote, “The expla- nation is that the natives thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony, and, being delighted with the rosaries which they were given to wear around their necks, presented themselves again and again for baptism, unrecognized by the Padres until long after.”</p>
                <p>The very success of the new faith, however, led to the first negative reaction by the Chamorros. Be- cause conversion was initially prestigious for the islanders, the chamorri nobles in Agafia demanded that baptism be restricted to them alone and not be accorded the manachang commoners. San Vi- tores insisted on equality of treatment. The cham- orri (presumably Quipuha and his clan in Agafia) were adamant, and San Vitores experienced for the first time some disrespect and even danger from the chamorri, wrote Garcia.</p>
                <p>San Vitores held firm and refused to baptize any- one unless he could baptize all. The chamorri gave in, and Quipuha was the first adult baptized. With much solemnity, he was given the title and name Don Juan Quipuha. The Jesuits had been instructed to bestow the Spanish titles don and dona before</p>

                <p>Victory for San Vitores in this first showdown was due not just to his strength of character. It was due also to indifference on the part of Europeans toward the values and customs of indios in general. For example, writing in 1681 of the Chamorros, Garcia stated contemptuously, “They have no laws whatever.” The Chamorros of course had numerous traditional laws. Their culture may have viewed the creed of the foreigners as powerful new knowledge and therefore a form of property. In their percep- tions, such knowledge was not public property to be dispensed freely. Rather, the knowledge of the new religion was to be restricted to the highest clans, particularly the clan that was the protector of the missionaries.</p>
                <p>Thus, in this first encounter over access to the new knowledge of the imported religion, the Jesu- its started the erosion of the traditional rights of the governing chamorri. Perhaps still in awe of the aliens, for the time being the chamorri accepted this restriction on their rights, but their tolerance would fade rapidly in the face of further uncompromising demands by the missionaries.</p>
                <p>Before baptizing Quipuha, San Vitores had al- ready initiated the destruction of ancestor skulls and carved idols over the vehement objections of the Chamorros. This missionary zeal led to a con- frontation with a “Chinaman,” Choco, who had come to Guam from the Philippines. Garcia states that Choco “began to circulate a report that the Padres...had been banished to Guam...that they would kill anyone they baptized, especially chil- dren, and that if one who was especially strong was able to resist that poisoned water, it would at least cause him to have dropsy, declaring he had seen it thus in Manila.”</p>
                <p>When some newborn infants died soon after bap- tism, the Chamorros began to fear that the baptis- mal water was poisonous, as Choco warned. Since the missionaries took care, in accord with Christian doctrine, to baptize infants who appeared to be near death in order to save their souls, the death rate was higher among baptized than nonbaptized</p>
                <p>46</p>
                <p>infants, thereby increasing Chamorro suspicions of the priests. By August 1668, only six weeks after the Jesuits arrived, the Chamorros began to turn hostile. On August 16, Father Luis de Morales was wounded in the leg on Saipan. About the same time, Father Medina was wounded in the face on Guam. And on August 19, the Chamorros killed a Spanish soldier, Sergeant Lorenzo Castellanos, along with his Tagalog servant, Gabriel de la Cruz, in a proa on the ocean near Tinian.</p>
                <p>San Vitores met the rising threat head-on; he sailed to Choco’s village of Paa on Guam’s southern coast in order to convert him. Prudently, he took along Captain Juan de Santa Cruz as well as three armed Filipino soldiers. The confrontation with Choco amid a crowd of curious Chamorros lasted for three days of public debate. It reached a climax when the captain saved San Vitores from an inex- plicable assassination attempt by one of his Filipi- no retainers just as the priest was about to baptize Choco. The captain was wounded, and the assailant fled to the hills above Merizo. San Vitores showed great coolness and proceeded to christen the cowed Choco.</p>
                <p>After San Vitores returned to Agafia, Choco’s conversion did not stick. The Chinaman may have harbored a grudge against Spanish priests from his days in the Philippines, where the Spaniards discrim- inated against Chinese. Choco renewed his agita- tion against the Christians. From then on, the field- work of the missionaries throughout the Marianas became hazardous. It took considerable courage on the part of the Spaniards and Filipinos to continue to go forth among the now-sullen Chamorros.</p>
                <p>Go forth they did, however. San Vitores and Luis de Morales sailed to the northern Marianas, in those days a hazardous voyage over hundreds of miles of open ocean in proas manned by converted Chamor- ros. Morales traveled all the way to Pagan Island in the north, while San Vitores crisscrossed Saipan, Tinian, and Rota before returning to Guam in early 1669. Everywhere San Vitores pressed converted is- landers to cover their nakedness in palm shirts and skirts (the original cloth brought from Mexico hav- ing been used up early on Guam). By this time San</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>Vitores himself presented a rather strange sight, and he appeared to be seeking martyrdom. Garcia de- scribes him:</p>
                <p>His cassock, which he invented in Agadna, was a sack woven of palm leaves, to which he added a hat and a bonnet of the same material.... He often went barefoot....In his hand he had a long staff with a Cross at its head, which with a handkerchief or simi- lar object, served as a banner....In some places he was badly received by the villagers and treated as an enemy who had come to take the lives of their children; and sometimes while he was in the act of preaching they threatened to run him through with their lances.</p>
                <p>In this kind of hostile environment, San Vitores must have been under great stress. To toughen his body and maintain his spiritual integrity, he wore under his cassock a cilice, a penitent’s jacket or belt with wire points protruding inward. He also prac- ticed disciplina nightly, according to Garcia, where- in he beat himself about the neck and back with a cord in the customary Spanish flagellation for peni- tence. Both as an example and as befitted his own modest lifestyle, he lived an ascetic life, eating main- ly yams, shredded coconut, and some fish, all foods that he found easier to eat as he had few teeth. He fasted often, and he entered trancelike states of reli- gious ecstasy “outside himself,” in Garcia’s words, in which he saw visions.</p>
                <p>Upon his return to Agafia in early 1669, San Vitores initiated construction out of coconut tree trunks and other wood of a seminary, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran (colegio in Spanish was then equivalent to a religious elementary school and not to a college of higher education). The school was to train carefully selected Chamorro boys to be inter- preters, altar boys, and catechists for the priests. It would not be in full operation until 1673 and would later be rebuilt of coral masonry called mampos- teria. This school, the first European academic insti- tution in Oceania, would last for over two centuries as Guam’s main school until the last remnants were demolished in 1893-1895.</p>
                <p>On February 2, 1669, a small wooden church named Dulce Nombre de Maria was dedicated.</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Quipuha died of natural causes, depriv- ing the missionaries of a powerful chamorri protec- tor. San Vitores insisted Quipuha be buried in the Agana church, the first Chamorro to be so honored. The headman’s family, however, wanted him in- terred under “what they called big houses,” accord- ing to a Jesuit report on the incident. San Vitores would not yield, and Quipuha was buried in the church with a mass. This dismissal of an important custom of the chamorri (that is, to have the skull and bones of the dead Quipuha under the family residence, where they could be protected by the liv- ing) provoked Chamorro resentment of the Jesuits in Agana for the first time, resentment that would swell into warfare within two years.</p>
                <p>In June 1669, to the immense relief of the be- leaguered mission, the Acapulco galleon San José dropped anchor off Agafia with Manuel de Leon aboard, the new governor-general of the Philippines. The previous governor-general, Diego Salcedo, had been arrested by the Inquisition (one of the hazards of Spanish public office at the time), and Manuel de Léon was en route to replace him. The galleon remained several days and unloaded badly needed supplies. The new governor-general also left six sol- diers, firearms, and ammunition for the defense of the mission. San Vitores sent off a batch of letters and reports, including another letter to Queen Mar- iana via Nithard. He proudly reported that 13,000 Chamorros had been baptized in the Marianas, or over 1,000 per month during the first year of the mission, figures he later lowered.</p>
                <p>The San José had sailed around Guam before finding the Agana anchorage. To avoid such navi- gational problems and to assist the missionaries, a royal cédula had been issued in June 1668 that re- quired the Acapulco galleon to put in at Guam. To prevent a galleon from missing the islands at night, the cédula ordered the mission to maintain all-night fires throughout May and June each year on Mount Machanao on north Guam and on the highest point on Rota, thereby bracketing the channel between the islands through which the galleons normally passed. Thus, over a century after Legazpi claimed it for Spain, Guam finally became an official port of</p>
                <p>47</p>
                <p>call for the Acapulco galleons on the old Urdaneta route. Some galleons nonetheless would still sail through the Marianas without stopping, and some- times several years went by without the appearance of any galleons, owing to wrecks or failure to sail from Cavite.</p>
                <p>After the San José’s departure, Father San Vitores traveled back to Tinian and Saipan in July by proa with the Malabar catechist Lorenzo. On Saipan, the Chamorros held San Vitores and Lorenzo prisoners awhile, threatening at first to execute San Vitores, then placing him in the hands of uritao young men who, after ridiculing him, let him go as a harmless fool. He and Lorenzo traveled on by proa as far as Maug in the far northern Marianas before returning by way of Anatahan Island in August 1669. There he split up with Lorenzo, each going alone to vil- lages to administer baptisms. In one village where a newborn child had recently died, the Chamorros accused Lorenzo of being a child killer. They killed him and gouged out his eyes. He was the first reli- gious martyr of the mission in the Marianas, and his body was never recovered.</p>
                <p>While San Vitores was coping with the hostile Chamorros and trying to locate Lorenzo’s body, a volcano erupted on Anatahan, frightening the islanders into letting the alien makahna go un- harmed. He went on to Tinian, where Medina and Casanova were caught in a full-scale war between the two main chamorri clans on the island. One clan in the village of Marpo was struggling with another in Sungharon village for dominance of Tinian. The Jesuits tried to mediate but became embroiled in the fight. Unable to calm hostilities, San Vitores left the other two fathers to hold the little church they had constructed while he returned to Guam for help.</p>
                <p>By now it was November 1669, a year and a half since his arrival in the Marianas, and San Vitores realized that his mission could no longer rely on the goodwill of some Chamorros to protect the priests. Jesuit historians such as Garcia depict San Vitores as a man of peace. That he was, but, when it appeared necessary, he did not hesitate to use force to impose his will on the Chamorros. His actions showed he was not a pacifist. On Guam, he organized a mo-</p>
                <p>48</p>
                <p>bile military force of eight Filipino soldiers and two officers, one of whom was the indispensable Filipi- no Captain Juan de Santa Cruz, to accompany the priests to convert the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>The squadron sailed by proas to Tinian and set up an armed camp between the warring villages. The Chamorros in Marpo promptly mounted a surprise night assault on the Spaniards but failed against the defenses erected by Captain Santa Cruz. This was the first armed clash of what would become the Spanish-Chamorro Wars and also the first time one of the two small artillery pieces of the Span- iards was used with grapeshot against Chamorro warriors. Intimidated by the Spanish muskets and the thunderous little artillery piece, the Chamorros of both villages agreed to a settlement. In January 1670, the two clans exchanged huge conch shells in the customary Chamorro sign of peace, but they re- mained hostile, particularly toward the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>Father Medina then left for the neglected par- ish of Saipan with two Visayan brothers, Hipdlito and Agustin de la Cruz. The Chamorros on Saipan had been aroused by Choco. On January 29, 1670, almost as soon as the three missionaries arrived, they were attacked by warriors, and Medina and Hipolito were killed by spears. Agustin escaped to report the murders. Captain Santa Cruz was un- able to retrieve the remains of the dead men until April; he wanted to raze the villages responsible for the murders, but San Vitores refused to allow any retribution.</p>
                <p>In March, the fighting flared again in Tinian. The Marpo warriors attacked the Spanish camp, which now had more fortifications around it. Two war- riors were killed, and the attack fizzled in face of the Spanish firearms. It was clear that only the fear of Spanish arms kept the Chamorros in check. San Vitores later wrote, “The natives of this and other Islands were afraid of our arms, and the rumor was soon heard that they [the arms] were much more than noise, and that infraction of the Law of God or of the good customs that we taught them, would not go unpunished.”</p>
                <p>With Tinian temporarily subdued, San Vitores re- turned in May 1670 to Guam, where more troubles</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>awaited him. First the Acapulco galleon failed to appear; then the dry season turned into a drought. Converted Chamorros began to seek help from makabnas to invoke ancestral spirits to make rain. San Vitores found himself struggling on Guam and Rota against a resurgence of traditional Chamorro beliefs. A number of his Filipino soldiers temporar- ily deserted to live with women in apostate Cha- morro villages before being persuaded to return to the fold.</p>
                <p>Rain finally fell, which was attributed by the Christians to San Vitores’ prayers and by pagan Chamorros to the makahnas. Among the Chamor- ros, it was no longer prestigious to be converted to Christianity, and the Jesuits were busy keeping those already converted from relapsing to the old beliefs.</p>
                <p>On June 9, 1671, the galleon Buen Socorro arrived from Acapulco with supplies, letters, a few more soldiers, and arms. It also brought four new Jesuit priests for the mission: Francisco Solano, Alonso Lopez, Diego de Noriega, and Francisco Ezquerra. The increased strength, however, was counterbal- anced by the departure on the galleon a few days later of three of the veteran missionaries—Casa- nova, Morales, and Bustillo—on reassignment. Bustillo would later return to the Marianas. With them on the Buen Socorro San Vitores sent three baptized chamorri young men, Don Ignacio Osi, Don Pedro Guiran, and Don Matias Yay. They were sent abroad as examples of the mission’s success, to broaden their education, and to help generate sup- port for the Marianas mission. Guiran would die at sea; Osi and Yay returned to Guam in 1675 after having visited Manila, Acapulco, and Mexico City.</p>
                <p>When the new priests arrived on the Buen Socor- ro, they found the Marianas mission under a near siege. The makahnas threatened drought and mis- fortune if all the Christian missionaries were not re- moved from the islands. A ranking chamorri head- man of Agafia named Hurao was on the side of the makabhnas. After the galleon with its cannons and soldiers departed, Hurao’s followers killed a young Mexican servant of San Vitores out gathering wood. In retaliation, some Spanish soldiers seized several</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>Chamorros as hostages and killed by chance a man nicknamed Guafac, according to Garcia’s history. This man turned out to be a high-ranking chamorri, thereby invoking his entire clan to seek revenge.</p>
                <p>Hurao gathered warriors for war against the Spaniards but took his time in the customary Cha- morro manner. Gifts had to be exchanged, chen- chule‘ obligations talked over, and food laid out by Hurao at feasts to motivate other villages to sup- port him. In the history of San Vitores written in Europe in 1700 by the Jesuit Charles Le Gobien, he “quotes” an eloquent speech by Hurao to rally his followers against colonialism. The Spaniards in Hurao’s time had no direct access to Chamorro war gatherings, so Hurao’s speech was likely made up by Le Gobien, based perhaps on a similar speech attributed in Garcia’s history (parts of which Le Gobien copied) to the Chamorro headman Aguarin before a battle in 1676.</p>
                <p>A converted Chamorro from Agafia named An- tonio Ayihi alerted the Spaniards to Hurao’s prep- arations. The Spanish soldiers then quickly trans- formed the Agafia church and mission residence into a crude wooden fort composed of a stockade and two towers, all constructed of coconut tree logs. Each tower held one small brass cannon. With their fort in order, the Spanish soldiers seized the initiative in a foray against the nearby Chamorro big latte houses of Agafia, where they took Hurao prisoner. As a peace gesture, San Vitores wanted to release the headman, but the soldiers refused to let him go. San Vitores then made peace overtures to Hurao but was rebuffed.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros attacked on September 11, 1671, with approximately 2,000 warriors. Using tactics of sudden separate assaults with sling-stones as their main weapons interspersed with attempts to burn down the buildings with flaming spears, the war- riors kept up the attacks day and night for eight days. Meanwhile, the Chamorros dug siege trenches around the stockade beyond musket range and lined them with human skulls facing the Spaniards in a string of skeletal grins.</p>
                <p>By this time, the Chamorros had learned not to fear the loud noise of the small Spanish cannons,</p>
                <p>49</p>
                <p>whose spasmodic firing caused little damage as long as the warriors kept moving. The islanders also constructed movable platforms with old canoes as shields behind which they could deflect musket fire while they closed on the stockade, Garcia noted, “to throw lances, stones and fire balls.” This medieval platform apparatus was an invention of Choco, who was present, according to one account of the battle.</p>
                <p>On September 18, when it seemed the Chamorros might overwhelm the fort, providence once more intervened in favor of San Vitores. A mammoth typhoon smashed into Guam, destroying almost all the Chamorro houses and wiping out most of the breadfruit and coconut trees on the island. The Spanish church-residence was also in ruins, but the stockade (miraculously, according to the Jesuit ac- counts, with some justification) was relatively un- damaged. The two towers, each with its small can- non still in place, remained standing. The Spaniards quickly repaired the stockade and prepared for more fighting.</p>
                <p>The Chamorros mistakenly thought the rains had wetted the Spaniards’ gunpowder. They mounted a final desperate assault, but the Spaniards repulsed them. The next day the islanders, now exhausted and without food, sought peace, asking only that Hurao be released. The Spanish officers did not want him released, but San Vitores insisted that the release of the maga‘lahi would bring peace. Hurao was freed.</p>
                <p>San Vitores was wrong. Hurao promptly ral- lied his people and again laid siege to the fort. This time the battle continued for thirteen days, until the Spanish soldiers took the initiative and sallied out against the Chamorro trenches in a bold raid. They scattered the surprised islanders and smashed the skulls along the trenches. Disheartened, the Cha- morros once more asked for peace, this time under a new leader, a second Quipuha who was a relative of the late Don Juan Quipuha. The Spaniards de- manded that the Chamorros attend mass every Sun- day and send their children to the church school and that they help repair the church. Quipuha accepted, and everyone set about repairing the damage caused by the typhoon and the war, but Chamorro resent-</p>
                <p>50</p>
                <p>ment of the Spaniards festered below the temporary calm.</p>
                <p>The second Quipuha would later take up arms again to fight the Spaniards, as would Hurao, who would be killed in battle. Choco, however, never reappeared in the Spanish accounts; his fate is un- known. The furious series of battles in 1671 had a great impact on the Chamorros, according to Gar- cia: “There had never been such destruction of their houses and fields as there was in this war which had been waged.... They said it was easy to see that their demons were powerless.... They said their Macajnas were imposters who promised things they could not give.”</p>
                <p>A Crystal Tomb for a Saint</p>
                <p>Thus was the parable of the tribes brutally intro- duced to the Chamorro people. San Vitores took advantage of his increased power to expand his au- thority throughout the islands. He sent Francisco Ezquerra to Rota and Alonso Lopez to Aguijan, Tin- ian, and Saipan. Lopez founded a school on Tinian. He also gathered cartographic data, including names for all the Mariana islands, and drew maps of Guam and the other islands. A copy of the Guam map ap- peared in Le Gobien’s 1700 history of San Vitores.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, powerful support for the isolated little mission was gaining momentum in distant palaces in Madrid and Mexico. The letters San Vi- tores had sent to Queen Mariana over the previ- ous four years started men, money, and provisions moving over the long Spanish colonial pipeline to the Marianas. Between June 1671 and June 1672, Queen Mariana issued no fewer than nine separate cédulas in which she ordered her viceroy in Mexico, the same Marqués de Mancera who had initially re- fused money to San Vitores, to supply the mission with whatever it needed, including the construction of a boat in the Philippines for interisland voyages in the Marianas. These cédulas were mostly in re- sponse to personal requests to her by Father San Vitores. This much personal attention by the mon- arch to one small outpost in the vast structure of the Spanish empire was unusual.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>Mancera dutifully complied with the queen’s de- crees, although the long distances over which com- munications and supplies flowed usually caused years of slippage before anything tangible reached Guam. The civil authorities in Manila, still opposed to the unprofitable Marianas venture, managed to prevent San Vitores’ boat from ever reaching Guam. As a consequence, much of the assistance the queen ordered for the Marianas mission would not reach Guam until after San Vitores’ death in 1672. De- spite his death, Queen Mariana continued to pro- vide money, soldiers, and supplies to the Marianas, including an endowment called an obra pia (pious work) for the School of San Juan de Letran.</p>
                <p>As part of the reduccion of the Chamorros, San Vitores ordered churches to be constructed in the main villages. Parishes were organized around each church as the center of new communities where Christian Chamorros would live and from which the priests could convert pagan indios. The prob- lem was that most Chamorros did not cooperate. There were, of course, many islanders who did com- promise with the foreigners, as can be expected in any society. Similarly, there were also those who welcomed change in the status quo. People in the latter group appear to have included many of the manachang lower caste, attracted by the elevation in their status.</p>
                <p>Opposition came from those who would lose privileges under the new system, primarily the chamorri, particularly the women, who were ac- customed to considerable freedom and did not wish to lose it in the male-dominated world of the Span- iards. This female opposition irritated the priests, who laid down the law that, in order for Chamorro women to become Christians, as Le Gobien wrote, “It was necessary for them to subject themselves and renounce their mistaken rights of freeom and independence.”</p>
                <p>Renewed Chamorro resistance started with a headman among the chamorri of Agafia whom Garcia called “one of the greatest principales of Agana.” This was the second Quipuha, who had been forced to accept peace with the Spaniards the previous year. He still wanted revenge for that hu-</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>miliation; vengeance was a strong trait of the Cha- moros, according to Spanish accounts. Since the peace settlement, Quipuha had also been rebuked several times in public by San Vitores for keeping a concubine. Fed up with the Spaniards, Quipuha arranged to have two uritao young men kill Diego Bazan, the favorite catechist of San Vitores, whom he had recruited in Mexico City. Bazan was killed in March 1672.</p>
                <p>On learning this news, San Vitores ordered all mission personnel to return to Agafia for safety. Two Filipino soldiers and an unarmed Spaniard were ambushed by Chamorro warriors, who killed the Spaniard and wounded the Filipinos. The Filipinos managed to kill the chamorri leader of the warriors, and, “in order to frighten the others, they chopped him into bits with their cutlasses.” The two soldiers then fled but were later caught by Chamorros and killed. Unconverted Chamorros all over the island began to stalk and kill Spaniards and Filipinos.</p>
                <p>While these skirmishes were going on, San Vi- tores had remained at Nisihan on the east coast with the catechist Pedro Calonsor in order to find the Visayan Esteban Dias, San Vitores’ old Chamor- ro language interpreter who had been with him the past ten years. The old man, tired of Jesuit disci- pline, had run off a few days earlier, much to San Vitores’ dismay. With Calonsor, San Vitores spent April 1 searching along the cliff line north of Nisi- han, where they thought Esteban might be hiding. Failing to find him (Esteban Dias, according to an account by Father Coomans, was killed in 1672; other accounts say he would disappear among the Chamorros for five years, reappearing in 1679 to be forgiven by the missionaries), San Vitores and Pedro hiked around the north side of Mount Barri- gada and spent the night with converted manachang Chamorros in the inland hamlet of Facfac.</p>
                <p>Early the next morning, on April 2, 1672, they headed for Agafia by way of the lovely palm-lined beach along Tumon Bay. San Vitores learned from the Tumon villagers that a girl had just been born to the wife of Mata‘pang, a chamorri of the village. San Vitores knew this headman; he had baptized him earlier and helped nurse him when Mata‘pang</p>
                <p>51</p>
                <p>was wounded by a lance in a fight. San Vitores went to him at his house and asked permission to baptize the baby.</p>
                <p>Like many other chamorri by that time, Mata‘pang detested the guirragos (or gilagos, mean- ing “men from the outside,” or “the north,” as the Chamorros called foreigners). A Spanish report after the incident stated Mata‘pang may also have feared that the Jesuit’s baptismal water was poi- soned. Mata‘pang angrily refused the priest’s re- quest and threatened to kill him.</p>
                <p>To give the headman time to calm down, San Vitores gathered some children and started them singing the catechism. In the meantime, Mata‘pang turned to a Tumon warrior named Hirao, who had earlier casually tagged along with San Vitores and Calonsor as they walked into the village. After some argument, in which Mata‘pang accused the reluc- tant Hirao of cowardice, the other man agreed to help kill the missionaries. The two Chamorros hurried off to a nearby hut for weapons. Seeing Mata‘pang depart, Father San Vitores stepped into the headman’s house and proceeded to baptize the newborn infant while Calonsor remained outside to watch for Mata‘pang.</p>
                <p>Mata‘pang and Hirao soon returned with lanc- es and machetes. Enraged by the arrogance of San Vitores in going ahead and baptizing the child, Mata‘pang hurled lances at Calonsor, who dodged several until one pierced his body. Hirao then split the catechist’s head with a machete. The Chamorros turned on San Vitores as he came out of the house and killed him in the same brutal manner, spearing him in the body and slashing his head.</p>
                <p>They removed the clothing and crucifixes of their victims and spread burning coals to consume the pools of blood from the bodies. Mata‘pang smashed a small cross that San Vitores wore, but he kept a large ivory crucifix of the priest’s. Next they dragged the naked bodies down to the shore, placed them in a proa, and tied stones to the feet. After paddling over the Tumon reef in the proa, they tossed the bodies overboard. According to some accounts, San Vitores surfaced twice to grasp the proa’s outrigger but was pried off each time by Mata‘pang.</p>

                <p>The martyrdom of Father San Vitores. The Jesuit founder of the Catholic mis- sion on Guam in 1668 is shown being killed on April 2, 1672, in Tumon. The Chamorro headman Mata’pang is spear- ing San Vitores, while Hirao wields the machete; both Chamorros are shown</p>
                <p>in loincloths but actually were naked. This engraving was made in Europe to illustrate Father Francisco Garcia’s 1683 hagiographic history of San Vitores. The Chamorros were drawn with primitive features in order to enhance the innocence of the slain priest. The first engraving for the Spanish edition of Garcia’s history showed San Vitores wearing clumsy eyeglasses. This version appeared in a later Italian edition, and the glasses had disappeared. (Francisco Garcia, Istoria della conversione alla nostra Santa Fede dell’Isole Mariane, Naples, 1686, pl. XV)</p>
                <p>When San Vitores rose a third time and grasped the boat’s stern, Mata‘pang smashed the priest’s head with a paddle. Father Diego Luis de San Vi- tores then sank for the last time into the crystalline waters beyond the reef of Tumon Bay not far from where Magellan had dropped anchor a century and a half earlier.</p>
                <p>The details of the deaths of San Vitores and Calonsor are contained in the first history of San Vitores’ life (Vida y martyrio de el Venerable Padre Luis de San- vitores) written in Spain by his fellow Jesuit Father Francisco Garcia and published in Madrid in 1683,</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 3</p>
                <p>only eleven years after San Vitores’ martyrdom. Garcia based his history on the various reports and letters written by the Jesuits in Guam. Garcia and other Jesuits based their accounts (which differ somewhat in particulars) of San Vitores’ death on statements attributed to Mata‘pang in bragging to other Chamorros about his deed and on one eye- witness account by a Chamorro. These Chamorros told the story to the Jesuits on Guam, who in turn reported it to the Philippines, Mexico, and Spain, where it was summarized by Garcia and others. The Catholic Church conducted four formal in- vestigations, called Processes, into San Vitores’</p>
                <p>FATHER SAN VITORES 1662-1672</p>
                <p>death: one on Guam in 1673, a second in Manila in 1676-1677, the third in Mexico in 1676-1679, and the fourth at Alcala in Spain in 1688-1689. These investigations confirmed the main facts of the mur- ders despite inconsistencies in the details. It was at the Manila Process in 1676 that the Society of Jesus initiated the request for beatification (which leads to canonization as a saint) of Father San Vitores. Beatification is a complicated procedure that in San Vitores’ case would be abandoned in the 1690s, then taken up again in the 1960s and completed on October 6, 1985, when he was officially beatified as the Blessed Diego of the Marianas, Apostle of Mi- cronesia, by Pope John Paul II in Rome.</p>
                <p>Father Garcia and other Jesuits wrote that San Vi- tores expected to be killed in the Marianas. All ac- counts agree that San Vitores held up his large ivory crucifix to Mata‘pang, exclaiming in Chamorro, “Si Yu‘us ma‘ase, Mata‘pang” (May God have mercy on thee, Mata‘pang), as he was struck down. Even granting understandable exaggerations by Catholic writers in describing the tragedy, Father San Vitores surely died as he lived, courageously and absolutely firm in his faith. He was both a hero and a saint for the Spanish empire and for the Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>53</p>
                <p>For the Chamorros, however, San Vitores brought a bewildering contradiction of the forgiving church and the intolerable military. His martyrdom and his ensuing glorification by the church would bring en- during benefits in the conversion of the people to Christianity, but it would also bring them massive tragedy through wars and epidemics. While San Vitores was alive, the islanders could refuse con- version without retaliation by the Spaniards. After San Vitores’ death, the Chamorros no longer had a choice: either they accepted Christianity or they were killed by the Spanish military, whose presence and authority expanded as a consequence of his martyrdom.</p>
                <p>To the Chamorros, therefore, San Vitores was both a conqueror and a savior, and their attitudes toward him have the ambivalence this paradox im- plies. Even today, there are Chamorros who are un- decided whether San Vitores was a villain, one of the alien horsemen of their apocalypse, or a saint who brought them God’s grace. Regardless of which view they took of Father San Vitores, after his death all Chamorros from then on would live in a new psychological universe of we pitted against a victorious, capricious they.</p>

                <p>The Spanish Conquest</p>
                <p>1672-1698</p>
                <p>A Mission of Soldiers</p>
                <p>Guam’s history might have been quite different if Father San Vitores had been an ordinary missionary whose martyrdom would have been duly celebrated but eventually forgotten among the thousands of other martyrs in the Catholic Church’s long history. However, he was not ordinary. He was a member of the church’s most militant order and the son of a high official in the Spanish government. Further- more, Christianity had been challenged, and the Spaniards considered it a point of honor to defend the faith. For these reasons, the Spaniards reacted with force to retrieve a failing religious effort, par- ticularly one in which their queen had a personal commitment. A key element in the Spanish response was the prompt initiative taken by the Society of Je- sus to beatify San Vitores by Processes, books, and commemorations, all of which focused attention on the Mariana mission.</p>
                <p>The news of San Vitores’ murder reached Manila quickly because the San Diego, the same ship that had carried San Vitores to Guam, arrived at Umatac just one month after his death. The galleon depart- ed five days later, leaving some soldiers, firearms, and supplies for the mission, now surrounded by thousands of unfriendly Chamorros. The Chamor- ros, however, were not united in their opposition to the aliens. In the period right after San Vitores’ death, the clans on Guam were divided into two</p>
                <p>54</p>
                <p>main factions. In Garcia’s words, “The villages in the southern part were friendly towards Padres and Spaniards, not to defend them, but merely to tol- erate them, while those of the north were declared enemies.”</p>
                <p>Within days after the San Diego’s departure, Spanish soldiers began retaliation for San Vitores’ death. On May 11 they caught and killed Hurao in a skirmish and then shot an innocent Chamor- ro woman and wounded her male companion when the two fled in panic from a Spanish patrol. This incident upset the Jesuits, and the new superior, Francisco Solano, called the troops together and asked that they refrain from violence against the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>The soldiers then busied themselves in the manu- facture of bricks from the mud in the Agafia swamp to convert their wooden fort into one made of bricks. However, a work party was waylaid by Cha- morros, and the project had to be abandoned. An- gered, twenty-one Spanish soldiers (of whom only thirteen were armed with muskets) under Captain Juan de Santiago set out for Tumon on May 17 to punish Mata‘pang.</p>
                <p>The troops avoided an ambush on the way and proceeded to the largely deserted village, where they burned a dozen or so houses and destroyed all the proas they found. They captured one man and his</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>wife. On the way back, the soldiers burned more houses along the beach at Ypao. Mata‘pang ap- peared, sailing a proa parallel to the beach in full view of the soldiers. He taunted them until a lucky musket shot wounded him and he fled. Mata‘pang and Hurao subsequently sought refuge on Rota.</p>
                <p>After wounding Mata‘pang, the soldiers marched around the inland side of Ypao, Saupon, and Oka points (now collectively called Hospital Point) to Agafia Bay. They were ambushed near the water’s edge south of Oka Point by two Chamorro forces, one from land and one in a fleet of proas from the sea. The Spaniards formed a square and fought their way along the shore to safety in Agafia, suffering four wounded by lances. Three of the wounded men died later in agonizing convulsions from what the Spaniards believed to be poison on the bone tips of the lances but may have been tetanus or peritonitis caused by infection.</p>
                <p>In the following months, the Chamorros used hit-and-run tactics by small bands of warriors, each band probably from separate uritaos more in com- petition with each other than in any coordinated plan against the aliens. In early June, two Filipino catechists were slaughtered on Rota and their bodies tossed into the sea. The Spaniards then constructed a large wooden enclosure near the beach in Agafia. This compound became the first presidio (a military garrison, comprising troops and buildings), with residential buildings and a church inside the walls.</p>
                <p>Hostilities persisted, and in May 1673 Father Alonso Lopez and his catechists abandoned Tinian and returned to Guam for safety. Because southern Guam was still friendly or neutral, the Spaniards constructed a church for Lopez at Fuuna (or Fufia), which was probably a village on Fouha Bay just north of Umatac. The village of Umatac still had no Spanish settlement at this time despite galleons an- choring outside the bay.</p>
                <p>Also in May the galleon San Antonio dropped anchor off Agafia with many of the supplies or- dered by Queen Mariana for the mission. Among the items disembarked was the first horse, “whose beauty and speed delighted the Marianos, for they had never seen such an animal.” The remainder</p>
                <p>55</p>
                <p>of 1673 passed in a peace that was deceptive. The calm was broken in February 1674, when Father Ezquerra and six Filipino catechists were massacred near Facpi Point. The remaining missionaries and soldiers kept to the Agafia presidio until the galleon Buen Socorro arrived off Agafia in June 1674, but it was blown out to sea by strong winds after only one load of supplies and passengers had been light- ered to shore. In the one launch that reached Agafia were Father Sebastian de Monroy and a Peruvian- born Spanish army officer named Damian de Es- plana, along with three soldiers from Mexico, two of whom were Cholula Indians and the other a mes- tizo. Nearly every complement of soldiers arriving on Guam from this time on included Spanish-Indian mestizos from Mexico as well as Filipinos, usually Pampangos.</p>
                <p>Esplana was a veteran army captain on his way to an assignment in the Philippines and had come ashore on Guam only to visit. Now stranded on the island and as the senior military officer, he was made the mission’s first sargento mayor (a Spanish military title, not a rank; it meant commander of soldiers at a presidio garrison and was not the same as a sergeant major in English).</p>
                <p>Of benefit to the Spaniards at this time was the fighting still going on between unconverted Cha- morro clans in northern Guam over old animosities unrelated to the menace of the Spaniards. Through divide-and-conquer tactics, the Spaniards were able to manipulate to their own advantage such divi- sions among the Chamorros, exploiting lingering traditional animosities between villages to foster commitment to the Christians as the price of alli- ance. Soon the missionaries were able to establish churches at Ritidian and at Tarague in the north.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Esplana vigorously pursued anti-Christian islanders. In November 1674 he at- tacked Tumon, killing a Chamorro who had mur- dered a Spaniard two years earlier. Garcia noted grimly, “The dead native was quartered and hung on two poles as a warning to other villagers.” Es- plana then burned “all the settlement.”</p>
                <p>Tumon never regained its former prominence as a village. Esplana had his soldiers erect a small chapel</p>
                <p>56</p>
                <p>of coral masonry and a cross at the place in Tumon where San Vitores was killed in 1672. In later years, an annual red tide (actually rust brown) of unial- gal blooms in Tumon in April was thought to be a miraculous appearance of the blood of San Vitores. The chapel and cross would also become the site of miracles for Christians, but the original buildings deteriorated into ruins over the years.</p>
                <p>In January 1675, Esplana made a sweep through the southern areas of Guam, which had turned re- bellious. On these forays, Esplana began employing a force of friendly Chamorros led by the convert An- tonio Ayihi, who by now was called Don Antonio Ayihi. One expedition burned Choco’s old village of Paa and the nearby village of Habadian, where San Vitores’ ivory crucifix and blood-stained cassock were recovered. As sargento mayor, Esplana rode the Spaniards’ one horse, which gave him an advan- tage over surprised Chamorro warriors, who feared the strange new animal they had never before seen.</p>
                <p>In June 1675 the galleon San Telmo left another horse plus twenty soldiers, firearms and other sup- plies, and two Jesuits—Lorenzo Bustillo and Gerar- do Bouwens—who had previously served on Guam. About this time, two Spanish soldiers encountered Mata‘pang on northern Guam and wounded him once more, but he managed to flee again to Rota. In July, Esplana followed with his enlarged force to catch Mata‘pang and punish the people of Rota for harboring renegades from Guam. People were scat- tered and houses burned as usual, but Mata‘pang escaped again.</p>
                <p>Calm returned for the next five months but was unexpectedly broken in a northern village. In De- cember 1675, Chamorros in the supposedly con- verted village of Ritidian killed Brother Pedro Diaz and his assistant when they tried to suppress uritao activities. The Chamorros then burned the church and the priests’ residence, and all the villagers took off in proas for Rota to escape the reprisal they knew would come. The reprisal came from converted Chamorros in the nearby Guam village of Tarague, who took advantage of the situation to settle an old clan revenge against their neighbors, burning the Ritidian houses and cutting down all fruit trees.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
                <head>CHAPTER 4</head>
                <p>The next flare-up came at Upi village in the north, where villagers led by the chamorri Quenano killed a Sicilian Jesuit named Antonio Maria de San Basi- lio. The priest—a tall, lanky man—had written pro- phetically in a letter, “The indios, being practical in throwing lances, want my arms and legs because they are long, in order to make lances from my long bones.” The Chamorros did just that; Spanish sol- diers recovered San Basilio’s body minus the legs.</p>
                <p>In June 1676, the galleon San Antonio arrived on schedule with more priests, fourteen soldiers, and two Spanish families, including children. It is not known if they were peninsulares (people born in Spain) or criollos (born in the colonies). The Span- iards maintained social distinctions between pen- insulares, criollos, mestizos, Filipinos, and indios (Chamorros, still also called nativos), in that rank order. At first, Filipinos were also often referred to as indios in Spanish records. In the 1670s, Span- ish, Filipino, and mestizo soldiers began to marry Chamorro women in church ceremonies and set up permanent households. The first church marriage between a Spanish soldier and a Chamorro was in 1674, when Juan Zubiar married Margarita Loyola (doubtlessly her baptismal name).</p>
                <p>Esplana departed on the 1676 galleon after he persuaded the commander on board, a Spanish gen- eral, to order a passenger, an army captain by the name of Francisco de Irisarri y Vivar, to take over command as sargento mayor on Guam. Irisarri was on his way to an assignment in the Philippines and had no idea of staying on Guam, but he followed orders and remained. To make the unexpected duty more acceptable to Irisarri, the general gave him the title gobernador politico-militar (governor, with po- litical and military authority), the first man to be so named, although the title was unofficial at the time.</p>
                <p>The Jesuits, unhappy with Esplana, requested the governor-general in Manila to separate the military and the church chains of command on Guam. The request was granted by the Council of the Indies in Spain (the highest governmental authority in the Spanish empire below the monarch), and the sepa- ration of authority began in 1680.</p>
                <p>Irisarri started off by making church attendance</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>obligatory for all converted islanders. He compelled them to send their children to the church schools to learn, in Garcia’s words, “duties necessary to the formation of a Christian and political republic, ban- ishing barbarism little by little.” Also like his prede- cessors, Sargento Mayor Irisarri attacked rebel Cha- morros, this time in the mountain village of Talisay inland from Agat. His forces killed five Chamorros, burned the uritao house, and scattered the villag- ers into the southern mountains. About this time, the Spaniards began to take away small Chamorro children who were orphaned or temporarily aban- doned during Spanish attacks on villages. The chil- dren were given to the priests to be raised in mission schools.</p>
                <p>In the same month of August 1676, an angry non- Christian Chamorro attacked Father Monroy at the Orote church where the man’s converted daughter (called Dikiki, “small” in Chamorro, in the modern folk tale of the event) was being married to a Span- ish soldier. Monroy was unhurt, but Irisarri quickly captured the Chamorro father and had him hanged in Agafia. The governor compelled all Chamorros in the vicinity to observe the hanging. To intimi- date the islanders even more, the governor allowed converted Chamorro children to drag the body to the beach, shouting “Let the dog die who has not wanted to become a Christian.”</p>
                <p>Not intimidated but extremely angered, a dy- namic chamorri of Agafia named Aguarin secretly organized an alliance of anti-Spanish clans in the vicinity of Agafia and the villages around Apra Har- bor. Garcia attributes to Aguarin, whom he calls “an eloquent Indian in his savagery,” a fiery speech to his followers in which the Chamorro declared, “I shall lead you with my lance, which has killed many Spaniards and will kill them all; then we shall be able to reestablish the freedom our fathers and grandfa- thers enjoyed, which we have allowed to be lost be- cause of our cowardice.” In late August, Irisarri sent a detachment of eight soldiers headed by his second in command, Sergeant Nicolas Rodriguez Carva- jal, with Father Monroy to the rebellious village of Orote on the peninsula above Apra Harbor in order to forestall an attack against the church there.</p>
                <p>57</p>
                <p>Threatened by Chamorros at Orote, the detach- ment retreated to what would later be Sumay vil- lage, where they were attacked by a large force of warriors but repulsed them with musket fire. A bap- tized chamorri called Cheref lured the Spaniards into fleeing with him by sea in a proa to reach safety in Agafia. When Cheref had the proa away from shore but still in shallow water, he treacherously capsized the canoe. With their gunpowder wet, the soldiers could not repulse Chamorro warriors who swarmed out from shore. All nine foreigners, including Mon- roy and Rodriguez, were killed. The Chamorros then burned the Orote church to the ground.</p>
                <p>Throughout the next few months, Aguarin expand- ed the Chamorro alliance, handing out many turtle shells as gifts. His efforts were monitored by the Spanish intelligence system now operating through converted Chamorros such as Ayihi. The Spaniards prepared for battle by strengthening the presidio stockade and gathering the mission personnel as well as many converted Chamorros inside its walls. Sen- try boxes were added to the stockade walls, which were still mostly of coconut logs. In October 1676 Aguarin gathered his warriors and mounted some unsuccessful attacks before settling down to block- ade the presidio. As supplies dwindled, the Spaniards cultivated yams and other quick-growing tubers in gardens inside the presidio grounds while occasion- ally charging out to skirmish with the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>After a number of false starts, Aguarin set in mo- tion a massive assault on the presidio in January 1677. The Chamorros approached the presidio in two forces with hundreds of warriors in each force. One group came by sea in proas, the second group by land. With both groups “occupying all the beach and the hills back of town,” Garcia wrote, Irisarri took a gamble: he first rushed his troops out of the stockade in a feint against the Chamorros on the inland side, forestalling an attack from that direc- tion. Then the Spaniards retreated into the presidio, where they had placed loaded but unmanned cross- bows and (according to Le Gobien) fake muskets along the top of the stockade to give the impression of a prepared defense.</p>
                <p>58</p>
                <p>This tactic held the Chamorros in check on the inland side while Irisarri led his soldiers out in a charge on the beach side, where they fired muskets at the warriors in the proas. The Chamorros took cover behind their proa hulls and moved out of musket range. The Spaniards set up a small artillery piece on the beach and bombarded the proas, scat- tering the Chamorros into retreat.</p>
                <p>Twelve days later, the persistent Aguarin massed his followers again in even greater numbers. Most of the warriors now carried shields of bark and wood for some protection against musket fire. It was to be a supreme effort by the Chamorros to defeat the aliens.</p>
                <p>Faced with impending defeat, Irisarri resorted to trickery. He knew each Chamorro warrior loved to show his individual prowess in battle. So the Span- ish commander placed a flag within musket range at a clear spot on the ocean side of the stockade, where he could mass the musket fire of his soldiers along the top. The governor, Garcia wrote, gambled that “some of the barbarians would want to capture it [the flag] in order to gain fame among their own people.”</p>
                <p>The Chamorros took the bait: twenty or more proas in the approaching sea force sprinted ahead to the beach, where dozens of warriors jumped out with their weapons and raced in a yelling mass to grab the Spanish flag. Just as the warriors reached the fluttering flag, the Spanish soldiers unleashed a withering musket barrage, mowing down the swift- est Chamorros in a bloody swath. The Spaniards then directed all their fire with muskets and cannons on the other warriors landing behind. Stunned and disheartened, the Chamorros fled the battlefield.</p>
                <p>Peace did not follow, only a deadly period dur- ing late 1677 and early 1678 of what would in later centuries be called variously guerrilla, insurgent, or terrorist warfare of sporadic hit-and-run raids by the Chamorros and reprisals by the Spaniards. Aguarin and his warriors retreated into fortified villages in northern Guam, principally Haputo, Tarague, and Janum. In June 1678, the San Telmo arrived at Umatac with a new governor-general for Manila, Juan de Vargas y Hurtado. He assigned a</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
                <p>new honorary governor and troop commander, Captain Juan Antonio de Salas, and thirty more sol- diers to Guam. Irisarri, who had not been popular with the Jesuits, departed for Manila.</p>
                <p>The remainder of 1678 into 1679 saw the Span- iards mount scorched-earth sweeps into unpacified areas throughout Guam, tearing down big latte houses, burning food stores, killing any hostiles they caught, and carrying off children to be bap- tized. On one raid they captured over forty children, who were turned over to the priests who always accompanied the troops. A growing force of con- verted Chamorros assisted the Spanish troops in hunting down insurgent Chamorros. The friendly Chamorros were led by Antonio Ayihi of Agafia, Ig- nacio Hineti of Sinajana, and Alonso Soon of Agat, all of whom were rewarded with increased author- ity by the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards encouraged Chamorros to kill known “troublemakers” and present their heads to avoid drastic reprisals by the Spanish soldiers. This brutal tactic was effective. Many heads were taken and brought to the Spaniards, according to Gar- cia’s history. In January 1679 the people of Mer- izo killed and presented to the Spaniards the bodies of the warriors who killed Monroy and Ezquerra, including the Chamorro leader of the band. Garcia states that Governor Salas “ordered that the man’s head be cut off and taken to Agadna.” There it was displayed to the public. Despite the measures to in- timidate the Chamorros, much of Guam remained unsafe for the missionaries unless escorted by armed soldiers.</p>
                <p>In June 1679, the galleon San Antonio arrived in blustery winds that prevented a full unloading of supplies. Several new Jesuits, a new sargento mayor named Joseph (sometimes written as José in Spanish accounts) de Quiroga y Losada, and a few soldiers landed by launch. Soon afterward, a Spanish patrol encountered the fugitive chamorri headmen Cheref and Aguarin as they landed a proa near Tarague. The patrol killed Cheref, but Aguarin escaped to Rota.</p>
                <p>In late August 1679, troops under Governor Salas attacked Janum, the most isolated of the remaining</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>rebel Chamorro stongholds. Janum is a beautiful little cove beneath huge cliffs on the northeast coast of Guam. Using friendly Chamorros from Nisihan, who attacked Janum in proas from the sea while Spanish and Filipino soldiers descended the cliffs, the Christian forces overcame the defenders of the village after a battle Garcia described as “the fierc- est which had taken place in the Marianas.” All latte houses and other buildings were burned, and Janum was never again to be a village.</p>
                <p>In late 1679 and early 1680, hundreds of desper- ate Chamorros on Guam fled their villages to hide in caves or to sail to other islands for safety from the Spaniards. Many Chamorros gave up in embittered resignation. Of these once fiercely proud islanders who surrendered, Garcia wrote, “They were re- ceived with much pleasure and were given to un- derstand that the arms of his Majesty are not meant to do harm, but to oblige them not to try to shake off the gentle yoke of Christ...the vain custom or solemnity with which they celebrated the deeds of their departed has fallen into disuse.”</p>
                <p>Agafia was becoming a small Spanish colonial capital with three districts (barrios) to which con- verted Chamorros flocked, “leaving their villages abandoned and even destroyed,” according to Gar- cia. Discipline among the mission soldiers declined during Governor Salas’ tenure. According to Jesuit complaints, some of the soldiers from Mexico were convicts conscripted into the army and shipped off to be rid of at home. Tuba and arak rice wine, initially brewed by Spanish and Filipino soldiers despite Je- suit disapproval, were now fermented by Chamor- ros. The soldiers were also distilling the even more powerful aguardiente. Alcoholism among soldiers and Chamorros increased. The islanders were also becoming addicted to smoking tobacco, which the Spaniards imported from the New World and the Philippines and started growing on Guam.</p>
                <p>In June 1680 the galleon Santa Rosa arrived on schedule. Twenty Filipino soldiers plus a number of Mexican-Indian troops disembarked. Juan Anto- nio de Salas, who had resigned as governor a few months earlier (probably at the instigation of the Jesuits, who felt that most of the military command-</p>
                <p>59</p>
                <p>ers had “little intellect and ability”), departed. He was temporarily replaced as governor for the next year by Captain Joseph de Quiroga, who had ar- rived the previous year.</p>
                <p>Don Joseph de Quiroga</p>
                <p>Quiroga was a veteran Galician officer and aris- tocrat respected by the Jesuits. He had fought in Flanders for Spain. With the appointment of this stern and pious man as interim governor (the Jesu- its called him the “Hermit” because of his lack of interest in women), the Spanish subjugation of the Mariana Islands entered its most severe phase. He received explicit orders to end all Chamorro resis- tance and to “be particularly solicitous about the pursuit and chastisement of murderers, rebels, and traitors who might impede the spread of the Chris- tian religion.” The implacable Quiroga would fulfill those orders to the letter.</p>
                <p>With more troops available to him, Quiroga es- tablished a base camp ina central location on Guam at Machaute Hill, now called Macheche. From the camp he sent out squadrons in every direction to hunt down recalcitrant Chamorros. He increased pressure on all villages on Guam and Rota to turn in anti-Spanish ringleaders, most of whom he sum- marily executed in public. He soon earned a repu- tation as a ruthless and resourceful leader. Out of fear of Quiroga, the Chamorros on Rota captured Mata‘pang. Lying bound in a proa and finally help- less after eight years of flight since he killed Father San Vitores, Mata‘pang died of wounds while being transported to Guam. His body was presented to Quiroga by the Rota Chamorros.</p>
                <p>The trophy did not placate Quiroga. Still dis- trustful of Rota, where many Chamorros from Guam found refuge, the governor invaded the is- land in 1680. There he captured Aguarin as well as other renegades. As usual, the rebel villages were burned. Quiroga ordered the people of Rota not to harbor any more Chamorro refugees from Guam. He rounded up 190 such fugitives and took them back to Guam, where they were resettled in the new Christian communities. Aguarin was brought back</p>

This map was copied in Europe and printed in Le Gobien’s 1700 history in French of the San Vitores mission, from a map drawn on Guam about 1672 by Father Anthony Lopez of the mission. Parish churches that existed at the time are shown as tiny circles with a cross on top. The title, Isla de St. Jean, is French for the Spanish name, Isla de San Juan, bestowed on the island in 1668 by Father San Vitores. The name was already changing to Guahan or Guan, as indicated by the other titles on the map. (Le Gobien 1700)</p>
                <p>to Agafia and executed. This courageous defender of the traditional Chamorro way of life died without tribute from either his enemies or his own people. With the Chamorros largely compliant on Guam, the Spaniards constructed a network of wide dirt tracks throughout the island. In this period, they divided the island into five ecclesiastical districts called partidos, each around a pueblo, or main vil- lage, centered on a church. Each district constituted a parish. Chamorros were compelled to move to the pueblos. A priest and a soldier were assigned to each parish, and converted Chamorro leaders, prin- cipales, were given civil duties in each district. The families of the principales gradually formed a new upper class, called principalia, which replaced the chamorri. Schools for boys and girls were created in each pueblo, with the priest as teacher. The villagers</p>

                <p>provided the upkeep of the churches and schools, but the Chamorros paid no tithes or taxes. By 1680, there were nine priests and three lay brothers on the island. The village priests and soldiers received from Agafia a small annual subsidy of supplies called a socorro and silver money, the situado or subsidio real, brought to Guam by the galleons from Mexico.</p>
                <p>In late 1680, a Spanish settlement was started at Umatac in order to serve the galleons that an- chored regularly outside the bay. The church of San Dionisio, constructed of wood with a palm thatch roof, was dedicated in Umatac village on February 11, 1681, nearly 116 years after Legazpi landed at Umatac Bay and claimed the islands for Spain. This church was burned by rebellious Chamorros in 1684, rebuilt again of wood, and destroyed again by a typhoon in 1693. It was rebuilt in 1694 of cor-</p>

                <p>al masonry and lasted until the great earthquake of 1849.</p>
                <p>Churches were also established in late 1680 at Agat and Inarajan. An inquisition was held in this period in which skulls used by makahnas as well as lances tipped with bones were gathered up all over the island and burned. In November 1680 a major typhoon swept across Guam. The presidio at Agafia escaped major damage, but Chamorro dwellings all over the island were blown away. Garcia notes, “This storm served a useful purpose in destroying the houses of the indios, thus facilitating the mat- ter of gathering them into the larger villages. The Padres at this time persuaded them that rather than repair their old houses they should build new ones in locations assigned to them. And thus they did.”</p>
                <p>Late in 1680, a magnificent shower of meteors fell over the western Pacific, portending major events in the eyes of the Jesuits. Forebodings by the Spaniards were confirmed in February 1681, when the new church at Inapsan (now Jinapsan) in the north was burned by supposedly converted Chamorros. All the people of the village immediately sailed off to Rota in fear of Spanish reprisals. They refused to return. Angered, Quiroga went after them in April, burned their new village, and made them all return to Guam.</p>
                <p>It is with this incident that Father Francisco Gar- cia ended his history, published in 1683 in Madrid, of San Vitores and the mission in the Marianas. Over the previous five or six years, soldiers had replaced priests as the principal agents of the Spaniards to bring the Chamorros to heel, but the Chamorros would nevertheless continue to resist. Unaware of the battles yet to come, Garcia concluded with unin- tended irony that “it was necessary for this land to be showered with the blood of martyrs in order that the church might reap her just harvest.”</p>
                <p>In June 1681, the galleon San Telmo furled sails off Agana and halted without anchoring. There disem- barked one Antonio Saravia, who had the formal titles captain-general, governor, and commander (in Spanish, maestre de campo) of Guam (now called Guahan by the Spaniards). Quiroga departed on the San Telmo for Manila. As Quiroga’s succes-</p>
                <p>61</p>
                <p>sor, Saravia (with the army rank of captain) had been given authority by King Charles II to act “in- dependently of the Viceroy of New Spain and the Governor of the Philippines...to conquer, explore, and govern” the Marianas “and the adjacent and southern lands.” Saravia’s appointment as the first official governor of Guam (and of what would later be known as Micronesia) was the result of a royal cédula in August 1679 in which King Charles II stated that he wished to retain the Marianas.</p>
                <p>The new governor initiated construction of a fort, named Santa Maria Guadalupe, in Agafia on the inland side of the Agafia River near the beach to protect the mission. Fort Guadalupe, completed in 1683, was of volcanic basalt stones and the stan- dard coral masonry in a slightly elevated one-story square of about 100 yards on each side. It could hold 400 soldiers, and bastions on each corner con- tained artillery pieces.</p>
                <p>More conciliatory toward the Chamorros than earlier governors, Saravia made the reliable Antonio Ayihi a “lieutenant general” (despite Ayihi’s scan- dalous relapse into sin with a concubine). Saravia also appointed other principales to command Cha- morro warriors allied with the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>On September 8, 1681, Saravia gathered all the Chamorro appointees at the presidio to take an oath of allegiance in the Chamorro language to the Span- ish king. In the oath, they promised to “abide by any law which His Majesty might be pleased to impose upon us.” After they had all signed their names, “albeit crudely,” cannons and muskets were fired, loud blasts were blown on triton trumpet shells, and everyone threw his hat into the air, shouting, “Long live the King Don Carlos Segundo.” This ceremo- ny marked the implementation of full Spanish rule over Guam. Henceforth, for the next 217 years until 1898, the people of the Marianas were citizens as well as subjects of Spain.</p>
                <p>How much the Chamorro world on Guam had been altered can be measured by the change in the value of hiero and lulok, formerly worth a Chamor- ro’s life. In a letter to Manila in June 1682 Gover- nor Saravia wrote, “Hachets, cutlasses and the like are very much on the market, and there is not an</p>
                <p>62</p>
                <p>indio who wants them.” By this stage in the con- quest, the Spanish authorities were assuming own- ership, in the name of the Spanish crown, of land abandoned by rebel Chamorros and redistributing it to Christian Chamorros and Filipinos.</p>
                <p>For a number of years, the missionaries on Guam had been pressing Manila and Mexico to assign a supply ship to make an annual round-trip between Cavite and Guam to supplement the Acapulco gal- leon stopover. The Manila authorities finally sent a small ship in April 1681. The timing, however, was too early to catch the southwest monsoon, and the ship was blown back by the northeast trade winds. In 1683, a second attempt was made. A single- masted sloop, the San Francisco Xavier, sailed un- der the command of Damian de Esplana, who was returning to Guam after seven years of duty in the Philippines. Also aboard was Joseph de Quiroga, returning after an assignment of two years in the Philippines. The Xavier caught the southwest mon- soon this time and arrived successfully at Guam in August 1683.</p>
                <p>The arrival was important as the Acapulco gal- leon of 1683 failed to appear. Because of storms, the galleon had never left Manila. After being destroyed by a typhoon and rebuilt, the Xavier later returned to Cavite. From then on until the 1740s (when they began to anchor in Apra Harbor) the Cavite supply ships made the trip to Umatac almost annually with the socorro of necessities such as soap, flour, tools, metal, animals, seeds, and so forth. The Acapulco galleon continued to bring some specialty supplies, but its main cargo for Guam was the situado in sil- ver coins to pay the garrison and mission personnel. Unlike Spanish galleons in the Caribbean, the gal- leons in the Pacific rarely carried much gold other than personal jewelry.</p>
                <p>The payroll money was usually silver Mexican pesos. Before Saravia’s arrival, the Jesuit superiors handled distribution of both the socorro and the situado. Beginning with Saravia, the governors took over the situado and most of the socorro except for the priests’ allotments. This control by the gover- nor gave him a monopoly over trade as the annual Cavite ship and Acapulco galleon provided the only</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
                <p>commerce with the Marianas until the nineteenth century. The official monopoly would allow future governors to profit tremendously from trade.</p>
                <p>Pressed by the ever-zealous priests, Saravia de- cided to reestablish the Spanish presence in Saipan. In October 1682, he headed off for the north with thirty soldiers in two Spanish-built boats. The Cha- morros on Saipan, “where the people are cruel and the most churlish of the lot,” according to Father Manuel de Solorzano, who was serving in Agafia at the time, were so threatening that Saravia retreated hastily back to Guam.</p>
                <p>In 1683, Saravia relocated the Agafia presidio buildings inland a few hundred yards around a new main square called the Plaza Principal. The gover- nor’s quarters, however, remained safely within the fort near the beach. An official governor’s residence, called a palacio in Spanish (sometimes casa real and casa de gobierno, and not equivalent to a palace in English), would not be constructed until around 1700 in Agafia on the main square. Sometime in early 1683, Saravia requested an increase in the size of the Guam garrison to 130 Spanish soldiers in or- der to complete the subjugation of the Chamorros. King Charles II approved this increase in 1685, but it took several more years for the additional troops to reach Guam.</p>
                <p>In November 1683, the ailing Saravia died. Es- plana succeeded him as interim governor, much to the displeasure of the Jesuits, while Quiroga took over command of the troops as sargento mayor. In March 1684, Quiroga once more invaded Saipan with the mission’s two boats, this time with a force of seventy-six soldiers that included friendly Cha- morros from Guam and two priests. On the way, they reestablished control over Aguijan and Tinian.</p>
                <p>Approaching Saipan, the invaders were chal- lenged by a large Chamorro force in proas, a fa- vorite tactic of the islanders. Quiroga, firing small cannons mounted on his boats, dispersed the proas and landed. After bloody fighting, Saipan was se- cured by the Spaniards by the end of April 1684. This kind of warfare, in which the Spaniards had all the firepower plus sizable manpower, must have</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>been discouraging to the Chamorros, who were still using sling-stones and lances plus some ma- chetes. Nonetheless, the islanders threw themselves into battle. In an eyewitness account of the fight- ing, Father Peter Coomans praised the Chamorro maga‘lahi Punni, who led the Saipan warriors, as “a brave man who met death boldly, hurling his last spear at us, but uselessly.”</p>
                <p>With the island conquered, Quiroga sent off a detachment of twenty-nine soldiers with Father Coomans to subjugate the far northern islands (called Gani at the time) while Quiroga constructed a church and fort on the western, leeward coast of Saipan for quick escape by sea. Quiroga’s men sal- vaged more cannons and swivel guns from the ever- productive wreck of the Concepcion. Since these weapons were of bronze that resisted corrosion, many of them could still be used nearly fifty years after submersion.</p>
                <p>In the meantime on supposedly pacified Guam, disaffected Chamorros launched a totally unexpect- ed assault on the Spaniards in mid-1684. Taking ad- vantage of Quiroga’s absence with the main body of Spanish troops, a lapsed Christian chamorri named Antonio Yura from Apurguan village on Agafia Bay organized a conspiracy among apostate Chamorros. On Sunday, July 23, 1684, as Governor Esplana was walking unarmed and unattended down an Agana street after mass, four Chamorro warriors attacked him with knives. Aroused by the screams of a boy, soldiers drove off the assailants and saved the nearly dead governor. One of the Chamorros was killed. An account of the attack by Father Luis de Morales, who was in Agafia at the time, says the dead man was Yura.</p>
                <p>While the attack on Esplana was going on, other armed Chamorros fell on Jesuits inside the church and in the priests’ residence inside the stockade. Wielding machetes, the warriors hacked two priests to death, one of whom was the father superior, Manuel de Solorzano. The Chamorros wounded four other priests, including Gerardo Bouwens. In the fighting, a number of Spanish and Filipino sol- diers were also killed, and several buildings of the presidio were burned.</p>
                <p>63</p>
                <p>With Chamorro warriors running amok in Agafa, disaster for the Spaniards was averted when a Cha- morro convert, Ignacio Hineti, led a force of fifty Chamorro warriors friendly to the Spaniards down from the hills of Sinajana to drive off the attackers and reestablish security around the outside of the fort’s walls. According to Father Morales, these friendly Chamorros were “men who had been reared in the mountains and therefore not accustomed to sail and had no knowledge of seamanship.” This indicates that Hineti’s warriors were mostly mana- chang lower-caste people from the interior.</p>
                <p>By a stroke of luck for the Spaniards, all the priests on Guam had been summoned earlier to a meeting in Agafia that Sunday. All reached the fort in Agafia that day and night, except for one. Father Teofilo de los Angeles at the Ritidian church attempted to sail to the northern islands to alert Quiroga of the Guam uprising. He was caught by Chamorros and hanged from the mast of the proa in which he was about to sail.</p>
                <p>Over the next few days, hostile Chamorros gath- ered at Apurguan to organize an attack. They sent out messengers and called for a general uprising against the guirragos. The Apurguan Chamorros were probably chamorri because of their village’s prime location on one of Guam’s best beaches and fishing sites.</p>
                <p>The delay by the Chamorros in following up their first surprise attack was an error. Just as in the two earlier Chamorro sieges of Fort Guadalupe, the in- ability of the Chamorros to act swiftly and decisively gave the Spaniards time to prepare a defense. With the governor out of action, a Filipino adjutant— Francisco Masongsong—and the Chamorro Hineti took charge at first, organizing the mixed force of Christian Chamorros, the seminary boys, and the mostly Filipino troops left by Quiroga to guard the presidio. By the time the Apurguan Chamorros mounted their assault on Fort Guadalupe on July 27, the defenders were ready and repulsed them.</p>
                <p>On August 19, according to Father Morales who was inside the fort at the time, the Chamor- ros attacked again. “The whole island came upon us on all four sides,” he wrote. Although gravely</p>
                <p>64</p>
                <p>wounded, Governor Esplana resumed command. As the masses of screaming Chamorros moved for- ward, they were attacked outside the fort’s walls by Chamorros under Hineti friendly to the Spaniards. The insurgents could not surmount the stone walls and had to retreat. A few days later, the Chamor- ros again attacked and again failed to breach the fort’s walls. Father Morales and the Jesuit historian Le Gobien both make clear that, without the help of Hineti’s warriors, the fort would have fallen.</p>
                <p>It is one of the ironies of Chamorro history that the Spanish mission was saved in the decisive battle of 1684 in Agana by Chamorros of interior clans, probably low-caste manachang or taotao tatte‘ (people of the south), fighting against fellow Cha- morros from coastal clans, most likely high-caste chamorri. For a brief period in these battles, the in- surgent Chamorros held their destiny in their own hands, but they failed. Firearms undoubtedly gave the Spaniards a powerful advantage, but that ad- vantage might well have been overcome by a united Chamorro effort against the weak Spanish forces in Agana in 1684.</p>
                <p>A Chamorro victory in Agafia would have left Quiroga and his small force stranded in Saipan and could have been disastrous for the entire Spanish mission in the Marianas. Defeat of the Spaniards could have forced them to abandon the effort to es- tablish a permanent presence on Guam or to delay it for a considerable time. After all, the military au- thorities in Manila had always opposed a mission there, and, with San Vitores dead, no Jesuit had his influence to retrieve the situation. The Spanish- Chamorro Wars brought about considerable unity among the anti-Christian clans. With defeat of the Spanish mission, the Chamorros might well have united all their islands, as the Hawaiians did theirs by 1800 under Kamehameha I, and then perhaps withstood sporadic alien incursions until 1898, when the Americans arrived in force. But this pos- sibility was not to be. In the end, the Spanish tactics of divide and conquer gave the Spaniards victory over the Chamorro clans, who could not unite as one people against a common enemy, even in a life- or-death struggle.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
                <p>The fighting in Agafia settled into a Chamorro siege of the fort. Sixty proas full of warriors came from Rota to help the men of Apurguan. They at- tempted to lure Hineti and several Filipinos who were married to Chamorros to desert the Spaniards. Hineti remained loyal, and the wavering Filipinos were kept in line by Francisco Masongsong. In the meantime, all attempts by the Agafia garrison to communicate with Quiroga on Saipan failed. A priest on Rota, the Bohemian Jesuit Augustin Strobach, attempted to sail to Saipan, but he was killed on Tinian when he stopped there. The Cha- morros then killed the remaining Jesuit on Rota, the Austrian Karl Boranga.</p>
                <p>On Saipan in the meantime, the unsuspecting Quiroga had sent south in early August a detach- ment in two Spanish boats to carry back to Guam ten of the cannons salvaged from the Concepcion. On the way, a storm forced the boats to land on Tinian, where the entire detachment of seventeen men was massacred by Chamorros. The Spanish boats were sunk and the cannons dumped into the ocean. Following this Chamorro victory, warriors from Rota, Aguijan, and Tinian sailed to Saipan to join forces with the Saipanese against the still unsus- pecting Quiroga and his force of thirty-six soldiers. The unpacified Chamorro force of about 800 men assembled secretly on Saipan to prepare a surprise attack.</p>
                <p>Alerted by a Chamorro informer, Quiroga mount- ed a series of raids against the camps of the Saipan Chamorros, followed by retreats into the fort, keep- ing his enemy off balance. A tough commander, he led his small force in combat and did not hesitate to execute one of his own Spanish soldiers who dis- obeyed orders.</p>
                <p>In mid-November, Quiroga finally managed to exchange messages with Governor Esplana, who or- dered the sargento mayor to return immediately to lift the Agafia siege, now in its fourth month. Quiro- ga gathered his men in eight captured proas and slipped away at night on the ocean side of the fort after faking an attack on the inland side. Three of his boats with fifteen men were swept away by cur- rents when they passed too close to Tinian, but in</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>order not to lose the rest Quiroga disregarded their cries for help. The fifteen men later made their way back to Guam with the help of friendly Chamorros. Quiroga and his men landed at the Agafia shore on November 23 and lifted the siege of Agafia’s fort.</p>
                <p>Within days Quiroga was raiding rebel villages on Guam, striking fear into the weary Chamorros. Ac- cording to Father Morales, “Large groups of them left this island of Guahan taking refuge in the neigh- boring islands.” About this time, Father Coomans and three soldiers reappeared in Agana, the only survivors of the detachment sent by Quiroga to the northern Marianas from Saipan. By early 1685, all organized Chamorro resistance on Guam against the Spaniards ended.</p>
                <p>In March of that year the English privateer John Eaton anchored his ship, the Nicolas, on the west side of Guam near Umatac. No Spaniards appeared at first, and the Chamorros were friendly, but two days later some of Eaton’s men were attacked by is- landers on Cocos Island. The English sailors “killed and wounded some,” according to the chronicle of the voyage written by William Ambrose Cowley. Es- plana contacted Eaton and gave him permission to kill as many Chamorros as he wished. The English- men killed three of four men they managed to cap- ture. After a friendly exchange of gifts with Esplana, the Englishmen sailed away to the west.</p>
                <p>In mid-June of the same year, the Acapulco gal- leon Santo Nivo arrived at Umatac with forty-four soldiers as replacements along with supplies. Es- plana, still recovering from his stab wounds, sent a personal request that he be relieved of his duties in order to recover in Manila. To placate the Jesuits during the interim while he awaited Manila’s reply, Esplana allowed Father Coomans to venture back to Saipan to explore the possibility of the Spaniards returning there. The brave but perhaps overzealous Coomans was promptly killed by the Saipanese in July 1685.</p>
                <p>The next year during the month of May, Esplana was waiting anxiously in Umatac for the Acapulco galleon when a ship appeared on the horizon. It turned out to be another English ship, the Cygnet</p>
                <p>65</p>
                <p>under Captain Charles Swan, with the English writ- er William Dampier aboard. They had been raiding the west coast of New Spain and arrived at Guam nearly starved after crossing the Pacific. When a Spanish priest and three Chamorros came out to the Cygnet, thinking it a Spanish ship, Swan took them hostage and sent back a Chamorro to demand pro- visions from the governor. Esplana quickly complied and sent out hogs and melons. Chamorros mean- while visited the ship and asked Swan to help them attack the Spaniards, but the Englishman refused. Dampier noted that many of the Chamorros were “troubled with a kind of Leprosie.” After releasing the priest with an exchange of gifts (Swan sent Es- plana a gift of a “delicate large English Dog”), the Englishmen sailed away happily.</p>
                <p>While Swan was on Guam, Esplana sent a boat out to meet the incoming galleon Santa Rosa to warn her of the English pirates. Alarmed, the cap- tain of the great galleon swung away from Guam toward the southwest and ran into a large area of shallow shoals, now called the Santa Rosa Reef as a consequence of the incident. The galleon was float- ed off with its rudder damaged, and on the way to Cavite discovered Yap, called San Barnabas at first and then La Carolina by the Santa Rosa’s chief pilot, Lorenzo Lazcano, in honor of King Charles (Carlos) II. This designation would lead to all islands south of the Marianas in Micronesia being called collec- tively Las Islas Carolinas, the Caroline Islands.</p>
                <p>In addition to the Santa Rosa’s failure to stop at Guam in 1686, the Cavite supply ship failed to ar- rive in 1687. By early 1688, the need for provisions was acute for the Spaniards on Guam. Relations between Esplana and the missionaries were worse than ever because of his failure to act against the Chamorros on the northern islands. In February 1688, Esplana took the extraordinary step of sail- ing off for Manila (over 1,500 miles away) in a boat he ordered constructed on Guam. He took four ser- vants, seven Spanish crewmen, and six Pampangos. He left Quiroga in charge as acting governor. On ar- rival in Cavite, Esplana was arrested for desertion. Following several months of judicial hearings in Manila, he was acquitted and again appointed gov-</p>
                <p>66</p>
                <p>ernor of Guam but remained in the Philippines until 1689 while he set up business arrangements for his private profit from trade with Guam.</p>
                <p>Obliterations</p>
                <p>In 1688, the brigantine San Francisco from Aca- pulco and the Cavite supply ship San Gabriel both reached Guam with long-awaited supplies, but the San Francisco turned out to be a ship of death for the Chamorros. The crew or passengers infected the islanders with what the Jesuit historian Le Gobien called a bloody rheum with fever, perhaps influenza or smallpox. With no natural immunity to Europe- an diseases, Chamorros died in unknown numbers from what is today called a virgin soil epidemic.</p>
                <p>The galleon that arrived the next year brought yet another unknown disease to strike down the Cha- morros. Eighty people died within three months. This modest figure actually was nearly 5 percent of the population on Guam at the time. Writing a year later, Father José Hernandez of the Umatac church stated that the entire population of the island, in- cluding Spaniards and Filipinos, was only 1,800 people. Of the seven previous parishes, only five remained: Agafia, Pago, Agat, Fina, and Umatac, which by 1690 was the largest, with 700 souls.</p>
                <p>The decline in population from the estimated 12,000 on Guam in 1668 when Father San Vitores arrived to fewer than 2,000 people twenty-two years later was disastrous. Numerous Chamorros born on Guam were still living in 1690 but not on Guam. They were the ones who fled to the neigh- boring islands and to the Carolines to the south. Fa- ther Hernandez estimated the total population in all the Marianas other than Guam to be roughly 7,000 in 1690. Nonetheless, the loss of Chamorros during the Spanish-Chamorro Wars was enormous.</p>
                <p>The Spanish-Chamorro Wars resulted from the vast incompatibility between the ethos of the is- landers and that of Europeans. In 1604, a Spanish writer, Miguel Agia, described that incompatibility with respect to Spaniards and the Indians of Peru in words that applied equally to the Chamorros: “The Spaniard and the Indian are diametrically opposed.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
                <p>The Indian is by nature without greed and the Span- iard is extremely greedy, the Indian phlegmatic and the Spaniard excitable, the Indian humble and the Spaniard arrogant, the Indian deliberate in all he does and the Spaniard quick in all he wants, the one liking to order and the other hating to serve.”</p>
                <p>The Spanish-Chamorro Wars cost the Spanish side a total of between 118 and 128 men killed, accord- ing to later Spanish accounts. Of these dead, twelve were Jesuit priests, six catechists or secular helpers, and the remainder soldiers, mostly Filipinos. For each Christian killed, 100 or more Chamorros died in the Spanish conquest of the Marianas.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of their policies, the Spaniards found themselves in a quandary by 1689. The ma- jority of Chamorros still alive in 1689 resided in Rota, Tinian, and Saipan, yet they were still not converted to Christianity despite the heroic efforts of the Jesuits over the previous twenty years. Guam was by then underpopulated. It was thus impera- tive for the Spaniards to move the Chamorros in the northern islands back to Guam not only to cultivate crops and livestock to supply the galleons and the Spanish garrison, but—most important of all—to complete the religious conversion of the islanders, which was a basic purpose of the Spaniards in the Marianas.</p>
                <p>With this formidable task facing them, the Je- suits were disappointed when Damian de Esplana stepped off the Cavite supply ship as governor when it arrived at Umatac in September 1689. He im- mediately began to squabble with the priests and Quiroga. Esplana was by then interested only in making money before his retirement. Annoyed at the Jesuit demands for action against Chamorros in the northern islands, he peevishly removed Quiroga from command of the troops for several months, re- lenting only after pressure from his confessor.</p>
                <p>Esplana solved his feud with Quiroga by simply moving to Umatac, where he constructed a palacio surrounded by a presidio compound. He divided the garrison between Umatac and Agafia and left Quiroga in charge at Agafia. This was the situation in June 1690, when two galleons from Acapulco ap-</p>
                <p>THE SPANISH CONQUEST 1672-1698</p>
                <p>proached Guam from the southeast. The flagship was the Santo Nino, and its consort was the Nues- tra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza. The Pilar was a big ship of 1,200 tons with 300 people aboard, in- cluding twenty Franciscan missionaries and 100 sol- diers and convicts from Mexico.</p>
                <p>The galleons had to tack into an unusual west wind as they neared Cocos Island just after sunset. The west wind pushed the Pilar, which had sailed ahead of the Santo Nino, into the southwest cor- ner of the Cocos reef, where she crunched up on the coral in shallow water. No one was seriously hurt, and everyone was evacuated to Umatac along with most of the cargo. The other galleon held off shore to take on the high-ranking survivors and retriev- able cargo. Three days later the Santo Nino sailed away to Cavite.</p>
                <p>The grounded Pilar’s cargo, timbers, ship’s boats, and parts of the superstructure were salvaged and used to construct a frigate and a schooner at Umatac. Soon the hull of the Pilar was pounded across the reef by the surf and slid into deep water off the southwest tip of Cocos with whatever cargo may still have been aboard, including perhaps illegal silver (it was stan- dard practice to carry illegal silver and goods deep in the galleon holds to avoid taxes). Three centuries later, in the 1990s, this questionable silver would be- come the object of unsuccessful treasure hunts.</p>
                <p>Esplana put the marooned soldiers and convicts from the Pilar to work on crops and in hunts for wild pigs. The Franciscans helped the Jesuits in the churches until they sailed to the Philippines in De- cember 1690 on the Cavite supply ship. In February and March of the next year, a rumor went around that Esplana was planning to send the soldiers and convicts of the Pilar to the northern Marianas to fight Chamorros. Alarmed at this news, eighty of the soldiers and convicts planned to escape by seiz- ing the Cavite supply ship when it next arrived. Es- plana learned of the plot and had twenty of the men shot on the beach at Agafia and another three shot at Umatac. The remaining convicts and soldiers then settled down until Esplana sent them to Manila in December 1691 on the frigate built from the re- mains of the Pilar.</p>
                <p>67</p>
                <p>Over the next few years, Guam remained tran- quil while Esplana monopolized the lucrative sale of tobacco and sugar, which had become staples for the islanders and mission personnel. Tired of war, he would not move against the Chamorros in the northern islands. The tranquility was shattered in 1693 when another virgin soil epidemic, prob- ably smallpox, killed Chamorros throughout the Marianas. The epidemic was followed by a superty- phoon that battered Guam on November 23, 1693. Churches all along the west coast were destroyed. Even the fort in Agafia was “knocked down” and inundated, according to Le Gobien. He states that the converted chamorri Antonio Ayihi rebuilt the Agafia church while Alonso Soon rebuilt the one in Agat. Both these old Chamorro warriors were by then prosperous principales as a consequence of their loyal service to the Spaniards over the years.</p>
                <p>Nine months later, in August 1694, Damian de Esplana died at age fifty-seven in Umatac. Quiroga succeeded Esplana as acting governor and processed the probate of the dead governor’s estate. Quiro- ga discovered that Esplana had misappropriated 56,066 out of the 108,991 pesos from the annual situados during the previous three years. This theft amounted to more than half the governmental pay- roll entrusted to the governor for the Guam garri- son for those years. Esplana had also amassed a tidy fortune through profits on trade passing in and out of Guam. Some future governors would continue these practices and refine them for even greater per- sonal profit.</p>
                <p>Quiroga buried Esplana in the Agat church and then set off in September 1694 with fifty Pampan- go soldiers to subdue the Chamorros in the islands north of Guam. He went first to Rota to consolidate control, build roads, and intimidate any remaining rebel Chamorros before returning to Guam. With Rota secure, Quiroga set sail again in July 1695 to the north with a strong force in a fleet of twenty proas and the frigate constructed on Guam from the remains of the Pilar wreck. When the Chamorros of Tinian saw the Spanish fleet, they sent their women and children to the small rugged island of Aguijan</p>
                <p>68</p>
                <p>(sometimes spelled as Aguigan, and now known as Goat Island for its only inhabitants).</p>
                <p>The Spaniards, however, bypassed Tinian and landed on Saipan, where the remaining Chamorros quickly capitulated. By this time, Joseph de Quiroga had a fearsome reputation as a hard man to oppose. He put Father Bouwens in charge of the Saipan mis- sion, where the Flemish priest would serve until his death in 1712. Quiroga backtracked to Tinian only to find the island empty; the warriors had fled to join their families on Aguijan. Sailing on to Agui- jan a few miles south of Tinian, Quiroga tried to negotiate with the Chamorros there. They defiantly rejected all peace offers.</p>
                <p>Aguijan has no beaches. It rises directly out of the sea, with steep high cliffs crowned by a flat top. Quiroga’s men landed and started up two narrow paths that led to the crown. One path was blocked, and the Chamorros tenaciously defended the other by rolling boulders down on the invaders. The Span- iards and their Chamorro allies led by a converted chamorri named Antonio Inoc pressed up the cliff to rush the Chamorros in trenches at the top. The defenders were finally overwhelmed after several of their men were killed. The surviving Chamorros were taken to Guam for resettlement.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 4</p>
                <p>In 1698, the new governor, José Madrazo, dis- patched a final expedition of 400 Spanish, Filipino, and Chamorro troops to the far northern islands of the Marianas. There the last Chamorro refugees, about a thousand people, were rounded up and sent to Guam. Many died en route when some of the boats were swamped by a typhoon. Thereafter, the Spaniards required Chamorros to reside only on Guam or Rota. A tiny mission remained on Saipan until about 1730, but from then on Aguijan, Tinian, Saipan, and the far northern islands would remain uninhabited until the nineteenth century, except for occasional fishermen and parties of hunters of cattle and hogs for meat to supply the garrison on Guam.</p>
                <p>And so ended the brutal reduccidn of the Cha- morros to Christianity, thirty blood-drenched years after Father San Vitores stepped ashore at Agafia. During those years, which spanned an entire gener- ation of Chamorros, the destiny of Guam was fixed for the next two centuries as a small outpost in the worldwide empire of faraway masters. The Mari- ana Islands now entered a period of semi-isolation under Spanish rule until the next invasion, when new conquerors would make Guam part of a differ- ent alien empire.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER ¢</p>
                <p>Oasis in the Ocean</p>
                <p>1698-1800</p>
                <p>The New Order</p>
                <p>With the depopulation of the northern islands in 1698, Spanish government in the Marianas settled into a benevolent but heavy-handed despotism on the southern islands. The governor’s title was gober- nador politico-militar, wherein he combined all civil and military responsibilities in direct authoritarian rule. He issued orders by edicts (bandos) and also acted as judge and chief of police. The legal system of the Marianas, like the Philippines, came under the church’s ecclesiastical law as well as the Spanish civil and criminal code called the Law of the Indies, which had been created originally for the Spanish colonies in the Americas but was amended to apply to the Philippines and the Marianas as well. There was no separation of church and state. Spanish jus- tice in the colonies employed retributive punish- ment, often severe, including fines, confiscation of property, forced labor, lashing, and executions (the latter carried out only in Manila for Guam convic- tions). All this was normal in European colonies worldwide at the time.</p>
                <p>The highest authority in each district (comprising a parish with a village center) in the Marianas was an alcalde. He was appointed by the governor from among active or retired Spanish or mestizo officers. His main duties were to maintain order in his dis- trict, to manage farming, and to raise cattle on es- tancias (large ranches) on crown lands. In the early</p>
                <p>1700s parishes grew to six: Agafia, Agat, Umatac, Merizo, Inarajan, and Pago. Rota was a separate parish but was administered at times together with Umatac, resulting in close ties between those two parishes.</p>
                <p>Owing to the meagerness of natural resources in the Marianas, large numbers of Spaniards were never attracted to settle in the islands. Consequently the system in the early Spanish colonial period of awarding private encomiendas (royal land grants) to Spaniards, as in the Philippines and other colo- nies, was not followed in the Marianas. The absence of private encomiendas on Guam protected the re- maining Chamorros from massive land alienation, as happened elsewhere to indigenous peoples in the Spanish empire. In addition to retaining much of their ancestral land, Chamorros remained largely free of tribute, taxes, and church tithes under Span- ish rule.</p>
                <p>Chamorro land tenure, however, changed under the Spaniards. The Spaniards introduced the con- cepts of land ownership by government for defense and other official needs, and by individuals and in- stitutions for private use. Communal ownership by Chamorro families of ancestral properties gradually devolved under Spanish rule into the hands of the new principalia class that replaced the old chamorri families. Spanish male primogeniture inheritance</p>
                <p>69</p>
                <p>70</p>
                <p>and pattido (the division of Chamorro family land, orally or in writing, among all children by parents), superseded the traditional Chamorro matrilineal system. Control of land, however, remained com- munal for families through the concept of “our land” instead of “my land.”</p>
                <p>Baptismal Hispanicized family names _ slowly replaced most indigenous Chamorro names. A small elite class of families called “high people” (manak‘kilo) evolved out of the principalia class. This privileged group lived in the center of Agafia in houses of coral masonry. They adopted Span- ish manners and clothing and were educated in the Spanish language, but they continued to speak Cha- morro at home. These families gradually came to own the largest portions of private land on Guam. The Catholic Church also became a major land- owner as land was bequeathed to it by parishioners.</p>
                <p>The small Agana elite, a kind of local “city” gen- try of about twelve families, tended to marry Span- iards and become mestizos. They remained socially aloof from the ordinary “low people” (manak ‘papa or taotao‘tatte) of predominantly Chamorro origin, who lived mainly in peripheral parts of Agafia and in rural areas. The manak‘papa women tended to marry Filipino soldiers since a high proportion of the Chamorro men had been killed in the Spanish-Cha- morro Wars, but the children were raised speaking Chamorro, not the various dialects spoken by their Filipino husbands or the Spanish spoken by the elite.</p>
                <p>Many ordinary Chamorros never owned proper- ty under the Spaniards. These landless manak ‘papa worked mostly as hired laborers on the lands of the principalia or on the crown ranches. Manak ‘papa who leased land or who managed to retain their ancestral properties worked on small ranch-farms called lanchos, where families raised pigs, chickens, cattle, fruit trees, and some crops on a subsistence level and for barter. All Chamorros, however, still had to attend compulsory religious services. As a re- sult, most Chamorros lived in two residences under the Spaniards: a formal one in a village where they attended church on the weekends and an informal one on lanchos where they lived and worked most of the week.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
                <head>CHAPTER 5</head>
                <p>While life in the villages plodded along in ac- cord with the religious calendar, life in Agafia and Umatac revolved around the yearly arrivals of the Acapulco galleon, usually in May or June, and the Cavite supply ship, normally in August or Septem- ber. Until the 1740s, both ships normally halted off Umatac. The supply ship waited at Umatac or Meri- zo until the trade winds were steady enough to carry it back to Cavite, normally around February. The landings of the two ships became so important that the governor transferred his residence from Agafia to Umatac when the ships were expected.</p>
                <p>After the ships unloaded, the supplies were trans- ported by boat the twenty miles or so from Umatac around Orote Point to Agafia since no road existed between the two towns and Apra Harbor was not yet a regular anchorage. Agafia had been designated back in 1687 as a ciudad, or city, but it was actually just a small town. In fact, it was the first “town” in the European sense to be established in Oceania. It remained the seat of government for the province of the Marianas, one of the smallest provinces under the Spanish administration in the Philippine Islands, which in turn was under the viceroy and the audi- encia of Mexico. Although Umatac also had a gov- ernor’s residence and was the main port until the 1740s, it was never the official capital of Guam.</p>
                <p>By 1700, the center of Agafia, then several hun- dred yards inland from where San Vitores’ original mission stood, was the large unpaved and irregu- lar Plaza Principal, which would later be named the Plaza de Magallanes around 1846, then renamed the Plaza de Espafia by the Americans after 1898. The main streets of Agafia stretched westward from the plaza toward Anigua and Apra Harbor since the Agafia River swamp blocked extension to the east. The town was divided into several barrios, which in turn a generation later around 1730 were subdivid- ed into barangays, or compounds, as in the Philip- pines. Each barangay contained up to fifty families, usually related to each other, with mostly Spaniards, Filipinos, and mestizos in the central barrios near the plaza.</p>
                <p>In the early 1700s, the main means of land trans- portation on Guam were two-wheeled wooden bull-</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>carts pulled leisurely by carabaos (water buffalo introduced from the Philippines) or oxen, the latter introduced from Mexico. These animals were also used for plowing. Ordinary Chamorros and Fili- pinos lived in thatched wooden frame houses that lined the narrow dirt streets of Agafia and the ru- ral villages. These houses stood several feet above ground on termite-resistant posts of local ifil wood, with the space below reserved for chickens and ani- mals. There was no running water and no sewer sys- tems. Kitchens were outside under a shedlike roof sometimes attached to the rear or side of the house. These Filipino-style houses would be used for nearly two and a half centuries until Agafia was bombed out by American forces in 1944.</p>
                <p>The arrival in June 1700 of the first Acapulco gal- leon of the new century brought a devastating epidemic, probably influenza. Over 650 deaths oc- curred that year, leaving memories for generations on the island of corpses “left unburied as there was no one to fulfill that general need,” according to a Spanish historical account. In light of the deplor- able conditions on Guam, the interim governor, Sargento Mayor Francisco Medrano y Asiain wrote to the king in 1701 with the startling proposal that Spain withdraw totally from the Marianas. He rec- ommended that the few thousand surviving Cha- morros be transported a few dozen at a time on the annual galleons to the Philippines for resettlement. As might be expected, the Jesuits on Guam objected to such an ignominious retreat. The Jesuit superior at the time, Lorenzo Bustillo, who had come to the Marianas as a student priest in San Vitores’ time, fired off a strong rebuttal to Manila.</p>
                <p>While the Spaniards argued over the future of the Marianas, the Chamorros continued to wither away. The Jesuits kept records of all baptisms and deaths of Christians and reported that, for the years 1698-1702, the death rate of Christianized Cha- morros in the Marianas continued to outpace the birthrate. By the early 1700s, the old generation of traditional Chamorros from the time of San Vitores was dying off. One such was Captain-General and Master of the Camp Don Antonio Ayihi, one of</p>
                <p>71</p>
                <p>the most reliable and valuable—to the Spaniards— chamorri converts to Christianity. He died in April 1702 and was eulogized by Father Bustillo in a let- ter to Manila as well as at his burial in the Agana church.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Spanish authorities in Manila and Mexico became apprehensive over the threat of English privateers when the War of the Span- ish Succession broke out in 1702 on the death of Charles II. Because of the threat of privateers, the Spanish authorities did not agree with Medrano’s proposal that Spain withdraw from the Marianas. Troop strength on Guam remained at 130 men in three companias de dotaci6n: two companies made up of men listed as Spaniards (who probably in- cluded many mestizos) and one company of Filipino Pampangos. The latter also provided carpenters and stonemasons for the garrison and mission.</p>
                <p>These companies, however, hardly constituted a crack security force. Spanish soldiers came from the poor and unemployed in Spain and Mexico and in- cluded conscripted convicts. Soldiers often had to go barefoot and without uniforms while on duty. The troops proved useless when the English priva- teer William Dampier returned to the Marianas in 1705. Dampier had unsuccessfully attacked Span- ish shipping off Central America before sailing his leaky twenty-six-gun ship, the St. George, badly mauled in losing a fight with a galleon off the Mexi- can coast, across the Pacific to drop anchor at Rota in 1705. There the crew leisurely provisioned before sailing off to the Far East without being threatened in the slightest by the Spaniards in the Marianas.</p>
                <p>Sargento Major Manuel Argiielles y Valdés, who served as interim governor from 1706 until 1709, took an informal census in 1708 and found the total population of the Marianas down to 5,532 people. Another epidemic in 1709, apparently diphtheria and typhus together, further reduced the Marianas population to barely 5,000 souls, according to a let- ter to Manila by Juan Antonio Pimentel, who re- placed Argiielles that year.</p>
                <p>These early Spanish governors in the Marianas, all army officers of modest background and stuck for years in boring but potentially profitable colo-</p>
                <p>72</p>
                <p>nial service, apparently formed an “old boy” net- work of mutual support. Argiielles, for example, was Pimentel’s son-in-law. Pimentel was a friend of his fellow Peruvian criollo Damian de Esplana and like him would enrich himself as governor.</p>
                <p>Among these officers, crusty old Joseph de Quiro- ga was an annoying anachronism. The “Hermit” continued to take the side of the Jesuits in the re- curring squabbles between the missionaries and the military governors. To remove this thorn in his side, Governor Pimentel reported to Manila in 1709 that Quiroga had used Chamorros for forced labor (the same charge would later be made against Pimentel by Quiroga). The governor asked Manila to assign an encomienda in the Philippines to Quiroga to get him off Guam. The authorities in Manila took no action on Pimentel’s request.</p>
                <p>Governor Pimentel’s tenure started off badly with the epidemic of 1709. That disaster was followed by the appearance the next year of more of the dreaded English privateers, this time under the command of the tough and skillful Captain Woodes Rogers. In March 1710 Rogers hove to off Umatac in four ships of war. The combined English crews num- bered over 200 battle-experienced freebooters. One of Rogers’ pilots was William Dampier, who knew the Marianas well from his previous two visits.</p>
                <p>Faced with this formidable fleet, whose guns and crew outnumbered his own cannons and ragtag troops, Pimentel prudently agreed to provide the privateers with whatever provisions they wanted as long as they put ashore Spanish prisoners taken in the New World, a condition Rogers agreed to. Over the next few weeks, the English and Spanish officers entertained each other and exchanged gifts. Finally, the freebooters sailed away to Mindanao in March with their ships bulging with bullocks, cows and calves, hogs, chickens, and dozens of baskets of corn, rice, and yams as well as coconuts. Rog- ers obligingly paid for the provisions with Spanish pieces of eight that he had earlier looted from the Spaniards in the New World.</p>
                <p>Pimentel’s—and Guam’s—troubles were not over with Rogers’ departure. The same year, 1710, a huge typhoon sent mammoth waves against the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
                <p>island’s western shores, inundating the old Fort Guadalupe at Agafia and wiping away whatever re- mained of it from the 1693 typhoon. Nature’s fury, however, was mild compared to the anger of Pimen- tel’s superiors when they learned of his generosity to the privateer Rogers. A magistrate was sent to carry Pimentel back to Manila in chains to answer to a special residencia (the highest judicial review of the conduct of Spanish officials) for aiding Rog- ers. The judges found Pimentel guilty in 1712. He had to forfeit the bond that governors put up when appointed; he was also removed as governor of the Marianas and sent to prison for a time while an- other residencia undertook an investigation of cor- ruption under his administration.</p>
                <p>Like many other residencias, which all governors underwent at the end of their appointments, evi- dence of wrongdoing was uncovered in Pimentel’s case, but punishment did not inhibit subsequent governors from undertaking similar shady prac- tices. Spanish colonial officials were grossly under- paid; consequently, some resorted to illegal means for compensation.</p>
                <p>Government by Neglect</p>
                <p>While the Spaniards were embroiled in fruitless bu- reaucratic housecleaning, economic conditions in the Marianas deteriorated. Although the Acapulco galleons were supposed to stop at Guam, for half the years from 1710 to 1720 they failed to halt, and in the four years 1723-1726 not one galleon stopped in the islands.</p>
                <p>The Cavite ship also sometimes failed to arrive. In addition to problems caused by the unreliability of the galleons and the Cavite ships, venal exploita- tion of the situados and socorros by some governors continued to cause hardships for nearly everyone but the governors in the Mariana Islands. The gov- ernors were able to pocket much of the cash of the situado and to profit enormously from the socorro by their control of the government storehouse in Agafia, where everyone had to buy supplies at prices set by the governor. Some governors marked up im- ported food items (sugar, chocolate, wine, etc.) as</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>well as uniforms and cloth by as much as 500 per- cent over the prices in Mexico, pocketing the prof- its. The governors as well as the manak‘kilo families readily extended loans to Chamorros and soldiers short of cash but at usurious interest rates.</p>
                <p>By 1710, the Chamorros found themselves being drafted regularly by the alcaldes to work on crown lands for wages as low as two or three leaves of poor-grade local tobacco for a day’s work—that is, from sunrise to sunset. This labor was a variation of the repartimiento system (provisional allotments of indio involuntary laborers to Spanish landowners) that gradually replaced the encomienda system in other parts of the Spanish empire. On Guam, with- out encomiendas, a local variation of repartimiento emerged that required Chamorros to work (called polo) on communal projects in lieu of taxes. This forced labor of Chamorros amounted to a form of peonage and provoked angry outcries from the Je- suits during Pimentel’s administration. He banished the two most outspoken Agafia priests to Merizo until Pimentel himself was hauled off to Manila to answer for the Woodes Rogers episode.</p>
                <p>During Pimentel’s tenure, an unknown num- ber of Chamorros on Guam still rejected Spanish authority, according to a French visitor, Le Gentil de la Barbinais. He was on Guam the first week in June 1716, when five French ships reprovisioned on their way around the world. Le Gentil de la Barbi- nais wrote that unconverted Chamorros still lived in the hills and went naked in the traditional manner. The Chamorros, he wrote, suffered from leprosy in “epidemic” proportions.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of Pimentel’s residencia, Cap- tain Luis Antonio Sanchez de Tagle replaced Pimen- tel as governor of the Marianas. Sanchez de Tagle was unpleasantly surprised when English privateers in the ship Success under Captain John Clipperton showed up at Guam in March 1721. They were there as a consequence of a brief war that had bro- ken out between Spain and England in 1719 over dynastic politics in Europe. At Umatac, Clipperton sent ashore a Spanish nobleman whom he had cap- tured earlier, the Marqués de Villa, who was to be exchanged for a ransom. After several days of pro-</p>
                <p>73</p>
                <p>visioning the Success in exchange for powder and other military items, but without paying the ran- som, Sanchez sent a letter to Clipperton “wherein the governor demands the marquis’ jewels, some consecrated plate, and two Negroes, being Chris- tians and subjects to the King of Spain,” all still held by Clipperton. Sanchez also kept hostage two of Clipperton’s officers who had escorted the marqués ashore.</p>
                <p>Angered and drinking rum heavily, Clipperton decided to capture the Cavite supply ship San An- drés, which was anchored temptingly in the narrow Mamoan Channel at Merizo. As the Success maneu- vered, it ran up on the coral reef of the Cocos Island lagoon that borders the channel. The Spaniards po- sitioned some batteries on a high point near Merizo and began bombarding the stuck English ship.</p>
                <p>In a desperate situation, with cannonballs smash- ing the ship’s rigging, the frantic English sailors— with Clipperton stone drunk in his bunk—returned the Spanish fire until the next day, when, after free- ing the ship and then grounding it again, they man- aged to haul the Success off the reef after fifty hours of fighting. They sailed away to the west with two dead and six wounded, abandoning their two offi- cers held hostage by Governor Sanchez. The fate of the two Englishmen is unknown.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Governor Sanchez had settled down to the routine exploitation of his fiefdom. Because of Jesuit complaints about the blatant mis- use of the governor’s authority, Sanchez had been given strict instructions by his superiors to clean up the islands’ administration. These instructions had no effect whatsoever. In a pathetic petition to King Philip V in March 1722—written and forwarded by the Jesuit procurator general of the Philippines—in- dios in the Marianas and Mindanao asked the king to “preclude the coming [as governors] of corrupt men, who blinded with greed, enslave the indios and soldiers...and that the governor not keep them occupied every day.” The king once more ordered that the abuses be corrected, but with little effect.</p>
                <p>Exploitation of the garrison and the mission by the governors was also opposed by Quiroga, who was still sargento mayor in Agafia. The “Hermit”</p>
                <p>74</p>
                <p>remained as stiffly moralistic as ever after over forty years of service to Spain and to the church in the Marianas. In 1720, Quiroga wrote a denunciation of Pimentel’s corrupt tenure on Guam. Sanchez got rid of Quiroga by retiring him in May 1723. Soon thereafter, the old soldier died and was buried in the Agania church. In the long sweep of Guam’s colonial history, Joseph de Quiroga ranks second only to Fa- ther San Vitores among the individuals who had the most direct personal impact on the tragic destiny of the once-free Chamorro people.</p>
                <p>Sanchez de Tagle angered his superiors in Manila in December 1724 when he recklessly ordered his sol- diers to fire on the Cavite brigantine San Francisco Xavier at Merizo after the captain refused some of Sanchez’ orders. The brigantine escaped to the Phil- ippines. Fearing arrest by officials in Manila and pleading sickness as an excuse, Sanchez fled to the Philippines with his family on one of Guam’s boats and hid in a monastery. He ended this melodrama appropriately by dying of natural causes before a residencia could prosecute him.</p>
                <p>While the colonial Spanish authorities bumbled along on Guam, the number of Chamorros contin- ued to decline. Indios, as they were still called, fell from 3,539 people in 1710 to only 1,576 in 1742, according to Jesuit records. By 1742, Rota had only 248 Chamorros, whose main job was to cultivate rice for Guam. Concerned with the decline, King Philip V issued a cédula in May 1741 that exempted Chamorro women from work “not appropriate to their sex.” Until then, they had been compelled to weave thatch items such as mats and baskets for sale to the galleons.</p>
                <p>Because the Chamorros appeared to be dying out, a proposal was first made in 1722 and repeated af- terward in various forms over the years to transport Filipino families for voluntary resettlement in the Marianas to revitalize the economy. Finally, in 1748, a ship with Filipino migrants sailed for Guam, but en route it sank, and all on board drowned, ending efforts for mass migration. Filipinos would never- theless continue to be the main migrants to Guam through individuals and small groups assigned as</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
                <p>soldiers and mission personnel. A Spanish census of 1727, for example, reported more than 400 families of Spanish and Filipino soldiers and retirees, most of whom had Chamorro wives and children.</p>
                <p>Frustrated with the many problems of the Mari- anas, in 1726 Manuel Argiielles, who was serving a second term as governor, proposed to his superiors an amended version of Governor Medrano’s sug- gestion of 1701 that Spain withdraw from the Mari- anas. Instead of total withdrawal, Argiielles recom- mended leaving a custodial force of three priests in the mission and twenty-five soldiers under a corpo- ral for security. The Chamorros, he said, should all be gathered into Agafia and Umatac.</p>
                <p>In Madrid, the Council of the Indies did not agree with these proposals. The council feared that, if Spain gave up Guam or reduced its defenses, other imperial powers could occupy the Marianas and threaten the Pacific galleon trade, which was Spain’s lifeline to the Philippines. If the lifeline was cut, Madrid believed that not only would trade be threatened, but the Christian missions might also be jeopardized. The sustenance that kept this long and vulnerable artery alive was Mexican silver. Spain’s colonies in the Pacific received about one-third of Mexico’s silver production from the sixteenth into the eighteenth centuries.</p>
                <p>This Spanish view of the new geopolitics of the Pacific was not unrealistic. Great Britain was in- creasing its Pacific activities, and France was be- coming a competitor for trade. The first French ship to visit Guam en route to the Far East was the Saint Antoine de Pade under Captain Nicholas de Fron- dat in June 1708. By the end of 1717, seventeen French ships had crossed the Pacific and touched at Guam, including the five merchantmen in 1716 with Le Gentil de la Barbinais as a passenger.</p>
                <p>Concerned that their closed mercantile system was being pierced, the Spaniards mounted a naval expedition in the New World in 1716-1717 that captured six French merchant ships and put a stop to the French trade for decades. Nonetheless, Great Britain and Holland remained threats. Thus, Ma- drid believed the Marianas had to be held to deny them to rival powers, even if the islands cost more</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>than they produced. This “denial concept” became a fixed geopolitical assumption of the Spaniards and later of the Americans in Micronesia.</p>
                <p>Instead of reducing Spain’s presence in the Mari- anas as Argiielles proposed, Madrid issued orders to improve Guam’s defenses to prevent incidents like Clipperton’s attack. Sometime in the 1720s or 1730s, Fort Santiago, a small emplacement with cannons, was erected on top of Orote Peninsula overlooking Apra Harbor. Then, in 1734, a new an- chorage for ships was opened in Apra Harbor that offered better protection from storms and was more easily defended than Umatac. And, in 1737, Fort San Luis with six muzzle-loading cannons was com- pleted on the northern shoreline of Orote to defend the anchorage. The harbor was thereafter called the Port of San Luis of Apra, with the shallow inner part, which was the most protected, called la calde- ra chica because of its craterlike topography and the larger outer part called la caldera grande bordered on the north by the Calalan Bank, Luminao Reef, and Cabras Island.</p>
                <p>After 1740 most ships began to anchor in Apra Harbor when the wind was favorable. Cargo was transferred to small boats, which crossed shallow flats to unload at a pier near the village of Piti. From there, the goods were carried to the govern- ment store in Agafia by two-wheeled carts pulled by steer or oxen. The lumbering old Acapulco galleons continued to make their stops—usually for only one day and without anchoring—off Umatac. Supplies from the galleons were still transported by boat from Umatac to Agafia, as no road was ever built by the Spaniards over the steep mountain ridges south of Agat, only short segments in the bays between the ridges.</p>
                <p>Argiielles left in early 1730 and was replaced by Diego Félix de Balboa, who served until 1734. He was the first naval officer posted as governor to the Marianas. He was followed by another naval officer, General of the Fleet Francisco Cardenas Pacheco, who died on Guam of natural causes in 1740. Thereafter, the Spanish government occasion- ally assigned navy officers (who were more liberal</p>
                <p>75</p>
                <p>than army officers) to Guam. Subsequently, Spanish treatment of the Chamorros mellowed into an indo- lent paternalism, although it was never a model of social responsibility.</p>
                <p>The next notable intrusion in the Marianas was the two-month-long visit of British commodore George Anson at Tinian in 1742 on the big sixty- gun, 1,005-ton man-of-war Centurion. Spain was once more at war with Great Britain (the War of Jenkins’ Ear, 1739-1741, which led into the War of the Austrian Succession, 1740-1748). Anson was sent to attack the Spaniards in the Pacific and to seize a galleon. At the small harbor on the leeward southwest coast of Tinian, the Englishmen captured a large proa (which was described admiringly in the several accounts of the voyage) with a Spanish ser- geant and four Chamorros. These men were part of the detachment sent regularly from Guam to Tinian to slaughter cattle and hogs and to dry the beef into jerky and the pork into salted spareribs to supply Guam’s garrison.</p>
                <p>The English sailors found Tinian to be paradise after the hardships of their Pacific passage. The Spaniards on Guam left the intruders undisturbed. With his crew restored to health and after a near di- saster with a typhoon, Commodore Anson departed Tinian in October 1742.</p>
                <p>The poetic descriptions of Tinian later published in England by Anson’s crew members and the excel- lent drawings by Lieutenant Peircy Brett were part of European literature in the eighteenth century that romanticized Pacific islanders as “noble savages.” Influential European readers of noble savage ac- counts in this period included the French encyclo- pedist Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the philosophical godfather of the American and French revolutions.</p>
                <p>In their writings Diderot and Rousseau pictured Pacific islanders as “children of nature” who were all free and equal through inalienable “natural rights” under a universal natural law. They held up this ideal—however problematic it was in the ac- tual cultures of the Pacific at the time—of popular sovereignty as the source of governmental authority in place of hereditary kings and religions. Eventu-</p>
                <p>A romanticized European view of ancient Chamorros. In the eighteenth century, reformers in Europe such as Jean- Jacques Rousseau idealized Pacific islanders as living in harmony with nature through inalienable “natural rights” un- like the class-ridden kingdoms of Europe. These ideas influenced revolutionaries in France and the American colonies to rebel. This print of an imagined precontact Chamorro village was originally drawn by A. Pellion on the visit by Louis de Freycinet to Guam in 1819 and shows high-caste matua (man standing at left and the one leaning against the tree with a basket of betel nut) bowed to by low-caste manachang in an idealic setting. In reality the Chamorros prior to European contact had to work hard at fishing and growing crops to survive against typhoons in a resource-poor environment, and they lived in a class-system with conflicts and inequalities.

                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>ally, in the late twentieth century, Chamorro activ- ists would cite the European concept of the natural right of all peoples to self-determination as justifica- tion for the independence of Guam from American sovereignty.</p>
                <p>While the roots of revolution grew in America and Europe during the mid-eighteenth century, The Spaniards on Guam occupied themselves with the construction of a new palacio in Agafia for the governors. Completed in 1744, this palacio would last—with many renovations—until 1884, when it was torn down and rebuilt by 1889, in time for the American governors to occupy it after 1899.</p>
                <p>Ship arrivals at Guam continued to be sparse and erratic from 1743 to 1753, and the number of troops on the island was reduced. Spanish neglect of the Marianas was exemplified in the modest cel- ebrations on Guam of the funeral of King Philip V and the coronation in 1746 of his successor Ferdi- nand VI. In July 1747, two galleons from Acapulco paused at Umatac with the news of these important events that had to be commemorated throughout the Spanish empire.</p>
                <p>The problem for the governor at the time, Do- mingo Gomez de la Sierra, was, in the words of his secretary Jorge Eduardo del Castillo, that “neither His Majesty nor this Infantry has in their Royal Ac- count [on Guam] a single existing real because of not having received a situado for four years.” In this situation, Governor Gomez de la Sierra “considered himself obliged to appear a faithful vassal” who should carry on the celebration with his own mon- ey. From July 26 to August 6, 1747, all of Guam celebrated the succession of the Spanish Bourbon kings with what pomp the little outpost could mus- ter with cash provided personally by the governor himself, including a “general pardon to fugitives and deserters...and lighted magiganga [slapstick festivities] by Chamorros.”</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Gomez tried to recoup his money spent for the 1747 celebrations by expropriating some crown property. His residencia in 1749 found him guilty of selling effects of the presidio and cut- ting down coconut trees for his personal profit.</p>
                <p>77</p>
                <p>More non-Spanish ships were appearing in the Pacific, particularly English men-of-war, which re- placed the privateers of earlier years. During the Seven Years’ War (1754-1763), Manila itself fell in 1762 to the English, who held the city for indem- nity until 1763. When the Cavite ship brought the news of the war to Guam, Governor José de Soroa (a naval officer who served from 1759 to 1768) mobilized all able-bodied men for defense in case Great Britain invaded the island. In addition to the complement of sixty soldiers then assigned to the presidio, the records show ten lists of men by village and by race: there were sixty-seven Spaniards, fifty- seven mestizos, one hundred Filipinos, and several hundred Chamorros. The English, however, ignored Guam. Instead, two British warships—HMS Dol- phin and HMS Tamar—visited Tinian, Saipan, and Aguigan in July-August 1765 for nine weeks. They were commandeered by Commodore John Byron and stopped in order for sailors sick from scurvy to recuperate. The Spanish authorities, as with An- son’s visit in 1742, ignored the British, who found the Marianas much less idyllic than Anson had.</p>
                <p>By the 1760s, Portugal and the Netherlands, tra- ditional enemies of Spain, had declined as maritime powers. As a consequence, in 1765 Madrid autho- rized Spanish ships to sail between the Philippines and Spain by way of the Straits of Malacca, across the Indian Ocean, and around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. The impact on Guam of these developments was that even fewer Spanish vessels stopped at the island. For the eight years between 1760 and 1768, no Cavite supply ships came to Guam, according to the account of a French visitor, Vicompte Pierre Marie Francois de Pages, who crossed the Pacific on the 1768 Acapulco galleon. Despite this isolation, however, one of the most dramatic events in Guam’s history under Spain was about to take place.</p>
                <p>Jesuits Abolished</p>
                <p>In the previous two centuries, the Jesuits had been the shock troops of Christianity, viewing themselves as the special soldiers of the pope since the founding of their society in 1540 by Saint Ignatius of Loyola.</p>
                <p>78</p>
                <p>They formed an elite force to counter the erosion of Catholicism by the Protestant Reformation and to strengthen the church worldwide through con- version and education of non-Christians in the new colonial empires of Europe. The mission of Father San Vitores to the Marianas in 1668 was one small element in the dynamic global commitment of the Jesuits to those goals.</p>
                <p>By the early eighteenth century, the Society of Jesus had become a formidable success. Wealthy, relatively independent of governmental adminis- trators, and politically influential in Europe and in Spain’s colonies, the Jesuits came to be feared by the Catholic kings of Europe as a threat. A central is- sue was nationalism—that is, national control over the Catholic Church within each nation—versus the dominance of the church by the foreign ecclesiasti- cal authority of the pope. The Jesuits were seen by the kings as siding with the pope and therefore pos- ing a challenge to national autonomy.</p>
                <p>In 1759 the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal and its colonies; France suppressed the society in 1764; and in 1765 Charles III reasserted his author- ity over the church by forbidding the establishment of any new monasteries, schools, churches, or simi- lar institutions, in the Spanish empire without his approval. And, on February 27, 1767, he issued a chilling cédula signed imperiously, as were all royal edicts: “Yo, el Rey [I, the King]... have decided to expel from all my dominions of Spain and the In- dies, the Philippine Islands and other adjacent ter- ritories, the religious of the Society of Jesus...and to confiscate all the properties of the Society in my dominions.”</p>
                <p>The orders to carry out the edict were sent throughout the Spanish empire in double enve- lopes under three seals with the intimidating mes- sage “Under pain of death this package is not to be opened until April 2, 1767, at the setting sun.”</p>
                <p>News of the impending expulsion did not reach Guam until June 1768, when a frigate from Aca- pulco, the San Carlos, arrived with the new gov- ernor and departed with José de Soroa. The new man, Henrique de Olavide y Michelena, was on his second assignment to the Marianas as governor</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
                <p>(1768-1771) after a twelve-year interval. He had the singular duty of carrying out the harsh cédula of Charles III.</p>
                <p>The orders of expulsion arrived on Guam in Au- gust 1769, on the Cavite ship Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, which also brought five Augustinian Recollect friars to replace the three Jesuit priests and one brother at the mission. The next day, Olavide imprisoned the Jesuits in the School of San Juan de Letran. Within a few days, all property of the mis- sion was confiscated, inventoried, and handed over to the Augustinians under Friar Andrés Blazquez de San José as vice provincial and new rector of San Juan de Letran. Two months later the Jesuits were shipped off with a few personal belongings to the Philippines aboard the Guadalupe on the first leg of their long voyage back to Spain with Jesuits from the Philippines.</p>
                <p>The banishment of the Jesuits occurred 101 years after Father San Vitores had stepped ashore on Guam to create the Marianas mission. During that period, seventy-five Jesuit priests served in the Marianas, of which thirty-seven, or nearly half, died in the islands. Of those, twelve met violent deaths as martyrs in the early years of the mission. In ad- dition six catechists were martyred by Chamorros. A Jesuit historian later wrote with sad pride, “The Marianas remained for many years one of the most dangerous mission fields in the annals of the Society of Jesus.”</p>
                <p>The impact on the Chamorros of the expulsion was negative after so many decades of Jesuit effort. The Jesuits had a large, successful ranch at Tacho- gna on a plateau in the central area of the island. This and other Jesuit farms were temporarily aban- doned and the livestock turned wild. Education was disrupted by the change; the School of San Juan de Letran, for example, was moved by the Augustin- ians to a different building in Agafia, and educa- tional standards declined over the coming decades.</p>
                <p>The entire Society of Jesus was dissolved in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV and would not be restored until 1814 under Pius VII. In 1829, sixty years af- ter the expulsion, in an official historical review, the Spanish government would belatedly acknowledge</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>that the Jesuits occupied the Marianas “in other times to the great advantage and glory of the church and state.”</p>
                <p>The Good Governor Tobias</p>
                <p>After the dramatic but brief turbulence caused by the departure of the Jesuits in 1769, the people of Guam and Rota settled back into their old routines of life, but they found the Augustinian Recollects more casual about the rituals and disciplines of the church than the Jesuits. The aftermath of the expul- sion of the Jesuits was softened by the arrival in Sep- tember 1771 on the Cavite ship of the new governor, Mariano Tobias (also spelled Tovias). This energetic and capable army officer served on Guam for fewer than three years, but during that time he improved the government and the material well-being of the people more than had all the twenty-six previous governors combined.</p>
                <p>The new governor moved quickly to improve ag- riculture, which had declined after the expulsion of the Jesuits. Tobias encouraged production of cotton, sugar cane, mangos, pineapples, and vegetables. The seeds and seedlings for these mostly introduced plants were brought in from Mexico and the Philip- pines. Many of the ingredients and methods of food preparation on Guam by that time were a blend of Chamorro, Mexican, and Filipino cooking, particu- larly the use of spicy Mexican peppers.</p>
                <p>Tobias established small cotton gins and hand looms to make cloth. He also promoted the produc- tion of salt. He brought in a herd of deer (Cervas mariannus) from the Philippines in 1771 and set them free. Called benadu or binadu in Chamorro (from the Spanish word venado), the deer survived down through the centuries and are still hunted on Guam. Tobias created a 200-man volunteer militia under Spanish officers and Filipino noncommis- sioned officers as backup to the regular troops. He paid the militia a small but regular salary (he stole no funds while on Guam) and had them raise crops on crown lands in place of the forced labor by Cha- morros. The militia also worked on roads and other public works projects.</p>
                <p>79</p>
                <p>By the time of Tobias’ tenure on Guam, Europe- an nations were dispatching numerous expeditions to explore the Pacific. On September 27, 1772, a French expedition—referred to as Crozet’s Voyage by English historians—anchored in Apra Harbor with two small ships, the 140-ton Mascarin and the 100-ton Marquis de Castries. The expedition had initially been commanded by Captain Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne. When the ships had earlier stopped at the Bay of Islands in northern New Zea- land, Maori cannibals massacred Marion du Fresne and fifteen of his men, and ate them all.</p>
                <p>The survivors sailed to the Marianas with Che- valier du Clesmeur as captain of the Castries and in overall command, and Lieutenant Julien Crozet as captain of the Mascarin. France was an ally of Spain at the time, and the Mariana Islands had by then a reputation as an oasis for recuperation in the Pacific. The expedition, with 200 cases of scurvy, remained at Guam nearly two months while the sick recovered with the kind assistance of Tobias.</p>
                <p>Crozet took notes in which he praised Tobias as a “worthy and honorable” man and described Guam as a “really delightful abode...studded with pic- turesque and delicious scenes.” Crozet noted that Chamorro men were “slightly given to drunken- ness...and are passionately fond of cock-fighting.”</p>
                <p>On Crozet’s return to France, an antimonarchist former priest in Paris, the Abbé Guillaume Raynal, read Crozet’s notes. Raynal incorporated some of Crozet’s statements into an anticolonial history that Raynal wrote about imperialism in the West and East Indies. Raynal sharply criticized the Spaniards for decimating the Chamorro people, but he praised Governor Tobias as a model exception to what Raynal described as the normal greedy and exploi- tive officials of the Spanish empire. The edition of Raynal’s history with Crozet’s notes was published in 1778 and became a best seller in France. The authorized, less inflammatory version of Crozet’s notes edited by one of the expedition’s members, the Abbé Alexis Marie de Rochon, would be pub- lished in 1783, but by then it was too late to calm Spanish outrage at Raynal’s allegations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the unsuspecting Tobias had been</p>
                <p>80</p>
                <p>posted routinely from Guam to Manila. When Raynal’s history became known in Manila in 1785, the Spanish authorities there removed Tobias from his regimental command and gave his salary to his wife, who left him when he fell out of favor. Ac- cording to the French explorer La Pérouse, who saw Tobias in Manila in 1786, the former governor of Guam was “reduced to despair.” Too progres- sive for his time and government, and the hapless victim of unwanted exploitive publicity, Mariano Tobias returned to Spain to undeserved obscurity. His fate confirms the view that no good deed goes unpunished.</p>
                <p>While that unfortunate scenario was unfolding, a disaster had occurred on Guam when a chicken pox epidemic enveloped the island in 1779, killing Cha- morros but few Spaniards, mestizos, or Filipinos. As a consequence, the Spanish census in the year 1783 showed the population of non-Chamorros (1,623 people, which included Spaniards, mestizos, and Filipinos and their descendants, with many of the latter Chamorro mixtures) had overtaken by a slight majority the Chamorro population (1,608) for the first time in the Marianas.</p>
                <p>After 1783, Spanish censuses showed ethnically pure Chamorros (called “Natural Indians” in the records) about equal in numbers with non-Cha- morros in the censuses until 1816. After that year, Chamorros were a dwindling minority until finally absorbed by the end of the nineteenth century into a hybrid neo-Chamorro mixture. The years from 1783 to 1816 were therefore a demographic tran- sition period in the Marianas. After 1816, the tide of genetic history would run inexorably against the remaining ethnically pure Chamorro taotao tasi, the once-free people of the sea.</p>
                <p>Explorers and the Geopolitics of the Pacific</p>
                <p>The year 1783 witnessed the conclusion of the American War of Independence, in which Spain was one of the victors for a change. With peace, Britain and France resumed their expeditions of explora- tion into the Pacific. Spanish reaction to the Brit-</p>

                <p>ish and French incursions into what the Spaniards considered to be their lake was to scold London and Paris in diplomatic notes that claimed Spain had ex- clusive rights as the only nation legally permitted to navigate the southern Atlantic and the entire Pacif- ic. Spain based this grandiose claim on the old papal bulls of the 1490s, which divided the known world between Spain and Portugal, and on subsequent us- age of those areas and treaties that confirmed the status quo in Spanish America.</p>
                <p>France and Britain, as might be expected, consid- ered Spain’s claim preposterous, as did another con- tender, Russia, which was expanding into Alaska and down the coast of Canada into Spanish Cali- fornia. Alarmed at these threats to Spain’s interests in the Pacific region, the viceroy of Mexico reported to Madrid in 1788 that “the Russian projects and those which the English may make...already men- ace us.”</p>
                <p>As a consequence, the Spanish court approved a proposal in 1788 by one of Spain’s brightest naval officers, thirty-four-year-old Italian-born Alessan- dro Malaspina, to mount a major expedition into the Pacific to reassert Spain’s presence there while adding to Spanish scientific knowledge and prestige. Malaspina was handsome, well educated, and— what would later prove fatal to his career—politi- cally ambitious. He assembled an impressive crew of 204 men and the latest scientific equipment aboard his new twin 306-ton corvettes and departed Cadiz in July 1789.</p>
                <p>Malaspina’s ships rounded Cape Horn in 1790 and explored various places on the coasts of both South and North America as far as Alaska (where a glacier was named after Malaspina). Two bota- nists accompanied the expedition, the French-born naturalized Spaniard Luis Née and the Bohemian Thaddeus Haenke, along with a Spanish geologist, Antonio de Pineda y Ramirez. By October 1791, the expedition was in Acapulco, where Malaspina pre- pared his ships to cross the Pacific, with the first stop to be Guam.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, economic conditions on Guam improved under a conscientious governor, Joseph Arlegui y Le6z, who served from 1786 to 1794. In</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>early 1791, Arlegui reported he was implementing a royal cédula of 1787 (the delay indicates the in- frequency of ships with mail in that period) that or- dered that gobernadorcillos, including men of Cha- morro background, be selected annually to assist the appointed Spanish alcaldes (who became alcal- des administradores) in the administration of par- ishes. Parishes by then were called municipios. Cha- morros proposed the names of three principales to the governor, who selected one as gobernadorcillo of the municipio for the year. This official was given the title don and his wife made a dona. The new system was the beginning of village-level indigenous government under the Spaniards in the Marianas, but from 1793 on public offices could be held only by men who spoke Spanish.</p>
                <p>Under Arlegui in July 1787 two Carolinians in a canoe drifted to Saipan and were brought to Guam, where they remained until July 1789, when a group of forty islanders from Lamotrek in the Carolines arrived in four large canoes at Umatac on a trading mission to obtain iron. This was the first planned expedition by Carolinians since the Spanish-Cha- morro Wars halted trade between the islanders. Two large canoes with thirty Carolinians had been accidently forced by winds to Guam in June 1721 and had led the Spaniards to send missionary expe- ditions under Father Juan Antonio Cantova to the Carolines. The first effort in 1722 failed, but the second in 1731 reached Ulithi and Faraulep, where the entire missionary party of fourteen, except for one Tagalog boy, was slaughtered. That put a halt to Spanish efforts to establish missions in the Caro- lines for the next fifty years.</p>
                <p>The arrival of the four big canoes in 1789 re- vived Spanish interest in the Carolines, which by then were being visited by non-Spanish ships. A young Guam-born sargento mayor, Luis de Torres, befriended the Carolinians, and with his assistance they departed several months later for Lamotrek with iron and trade goods and a promise to return. The voyagers never reached Lamotrek. The people there assumed that the voyagers were killed by the still-feared Spaniards and so did not attempt to sail to Guam again. On Guam, Luis de Torres was puz-</p>
                <p>81</p>
                <p>zled by the failure of the Lamotrekese to return as promised. He would not get an answer for fifteen years, until 1804, when he visited the Micronesian island of Woleai, but in the interim the matter re- mained a mystery.</p>
                <p>While Torres was waiting for the Lamotrekese to return to Guam, the two ships of the Malaspina expedition anchored off Umatac in 1792. Unfortu- nately, the crews brought disease (unnamed in the accounts) from Acapulco, where an epidemic had caused many deaths. Despite the disease, Malaspi- na’s botanists made a thorough collection of plants in the Marianas, with Née covering the south and Haenke the north of Guam, while Pineda mapped the geology and zoology of the island. Pineda noted in his diary, “There are no roads other than narrow trails and the footpaths of horses and riding oxen.” The only real road connected the pier at Piti in Apra Harbor with Agafia and was composed of crushed limestone cascajo.</p>
                <p>After twelve days on Guam with a side trip to Ti- nian, the Malaspina expedition departed, returning to Cadiz in September 1794. Initially on Malaspi- na’s return he was acclaimed and promoted. Soon, however, he was caught up in court intrigues and ro- mantically involved with Italian-born Queen Maria Luisa de Parma (wife of Charles IV, she was called La Parmesana after the sharp Italian cheese because of her voracious sexual appetite). The queen and the chief minister, the unscrupulous Manuel de Godoy, were lovers, and Malaspina maneuvered to replace Godoy as the queen’s favorite. Godoy reacted by having his rival arrested for “reasons of state.” In this corrupt and deceitful atmosphere, Malaspina was convicted in 1796, stripped of his rank, and im- prisoned for nearly seven years, followed by banish- ment and an obscure death in Italy in 1810.</p>
                <p>Of perhaps greater tragedy than his shabby treat- ment of Malaspina, Godoy also impounded all the expedition’s 4,000 or so documents and over 800 drawings. Furthermore, Godoy prevented publica- tion of the scientific materials. Malaspina’s trip di- ary was not published until 1885. One result of the Spanish government’s suppression of information</p>

                <p>from the Malaspina voyage was that the European public remained ignorant of the many accomplish- ments of Spanish explorations in the Pacific. In contrast, Britain and France widely publicized the endeavors of their explorers. Thus, Tahiti, Hawai‘i, and Polynesia in general became imprinted on Euro- pean and American public perceptions as exemplify- ing the Pacific island world, while the Spanish Mari- anas and the rest of Micronesia, cut off from open commerce and described mainly in closed Spanish official documents, remained generally unknown.</p>
                <p>As Malaspina’s fate was being played out in Spain, disastrous events were occurring on Guam. In March 1793, a huge fire swept through the build- ings of Agafia, nearly destroying the town. Just as the inhabitants were getting back to normal con- ditions, a monstrous typhoon struck the island in December, destroying all crops and most fruit trees. Soon the islanders had slaughtered most of their do-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 5</p>
                <p>mestic animals and began killing off the deer, wild pigs, and wild cattle for food.</p>
                <p>Then another disaster struck in September 1794, this time a flu epidemic that caused convulsive coughing and killed its victims within a week. The flu was brought to the island by the ship on which the new governor, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Muro, and his wife arrived and on which Arlegui happily departed. The epidemic lasted three months. With Guam nearly devastated, Governor Muro—a veteran peninsular who was forty-two years old, fat, and in poor health owing to dropsy—took vigor- ous action. With his own money, he bought rice as well as clothes from the ship’s cargo and distributed them free to the people. To protect the island’s deer and wild cattle from being wiped out, he prohibited further hunting. He laid out a new town plan for Agafia and put everyone to work on reconstruction.</p>
                <p>Because Spain was at war again in this period (first against revolutionary France in 1792-1795,</p>
                <p>OASIS IN THE OCEAN 1698-1800</p>
                <p>then against Britain in 1796-1802; Spain lost both wars), all Spanish governors received orders to strengthen defenses in the empire. Muro used these orders to construct new forts and rebuild the main Agafia warehouse (almacén) of coral masonry near the palacio with a large enclosing wall. These proj- ects were completed in 1799. Three main arches of the almacén wall still stand.</p>
                <p>Next, Muro built the stone bridge of San Antonio across a branch of the Agana River and Fort Santa Agueda (named after his wife) on Apugan Hill over- looking Agafia, completing both in the year 1800. The hill fort, now called Fort Apugan, still stands. The San Antonio Bridge remains in place also. It is now a historical monument in a small park (the river channel has been diverted) along with a statue erected in the 1970s of Sirena, a mermaid in a lo- cal legend. By 1800, Muro was constructing in Apra Harbor a new fort with stone walls over sixteen feet</p>
                <p>83</p>
                <p>thick and embrasures for eleven cannons. Named Fort Santa Cruz, this massive structure was com- pleted in 1801 on the south side of the harbor to re- place old Fort San Luis, which was in ruins by then.</p>
                <p>While these various projects were under way, Governor Muro ordered, as usual every year, a Te Deum mass to be given at the Agafia church on No- vember 4, 1798, in honor of the king’s name day. This mass also marked another anniversary, but one not observed, in that it was held almost exactly 100 years after the end of the Spanish-Chamorro Wars when the last rebellious Chamorros were forcibly resettled from the northern Marianas to Guam in 1698. In that century, the traditional Chamorro cul- ture had changed greatly, but the core elements— the Chamorro language, maternal control of family life, and a sturdy sense of a distinctive identity—en- dured as Guam entered a new century.</p>

                <p>1800-189</p>
                <p>Americans, Alien Islanders, and Stagnation</p>
                <p>The last century of Spanish rule in the Marianas be- gan with minor but bad omens for the Spaniards. In 1798, Governor Muro’s wife became sick and lingered near death for a long time. The governor fell into a severe depression owing to “melancholia” over his wife’s illness, according to Spanish records, and in November 1799 sent a letter of resigna- tion to Manila. In 1800, Governor-General Rafael Maria de Aguilar accepted Muro’s resignation and named as his replacement Vicente Blanco. This rou- tine administrative event—the leisurely replacement of a worn-out governor with a new man—would be repeated twenty-six more times before Spanish rule in the Marianas would stumble to an end like a slow death after a long sickness.</p>
                <p>As of 1800, Guam had been without supplies for three years. So in 1801 the new governor resorted to chartering an American ship—the bark Lydia from Boston, trading out of Manila under Captain Moses Barnard—to take him and his party from Manila to Guam “for 5,000 Spanish dollars.” With the rise in Pacific trade, the term “Spanish dollars” gained use, usually in reference to the Spanish duro silver peso coin worth twenty Spanish reales after 1850. There was no paper currency in the Pacific at the time.</p>
                <p>The Lydia dropped anchor in Apra Harbor in January 1802. Governor Muro’s wife meanwhile had died and was preserved in a special coffin</p>
                <p>84</p>
                <p>while waiting to be shipped back to Manila aboard the Lydia. The Chamorros described Muro to the Spanish-speaking first officer of the Lydia, William Haswell, as a “great Tyrant” who ran the island for his own profit in the time-honored Spanish colo- nial way. Grievances against Muro were raised at his residencia, but the investigation ended by com- mending him.</p>
                <p>Of the ordinary people of Guam in 1802, Haswell wrote (in early nineteenth-century American prose):</p>
                <p>I frequently went into Indian Inland Villages, and always found them hard at work with the Tobac- co, which all belongs to the King and as soon dry’d must be carried to the Governor, and he sells it at a Enormous Price as is everything else.... They are generally healthy and strong, but the Venereal had made sad Ravages amongst them....In the Inland places the Men and Women go Naked, but they have Cloathes and on the Appearance of a European they run and put them on and are proud of being dressed; but they cannot buy Clothes to wear in Common they are so dear, as the governor gains 8 hundred per Cent on all he sells them, and no other person is allow’d to trade.</p>
                <p>Many other American ships would halt at Guam in the coming years as the whaling and fur seal in- dustries expanded in the Pacific along with the Chi- na trade. Guam’s modest share in this commerce in</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>the early nineteenth century included the provision- ing of ships with fresh produce and livestock, just as in the old galleon days, but with the sale of trepang (also called béche de mer and balate) now added. Trepang, also called sea cucumbers or holothurians, are slow-moving sea slugs. Easily caught, cleaned, and smoked, the rubbery shrunken trepang skins were shipped from all over the Pacific to China, where they sold for “15 Spanish dollars the Hun- dred pounds,” according to Haswell. In China tre- pang were used mainly in soup and were thought to be an aphrodisiac. On Guam the Spanish governor held the monopoly on the trepang trade.</p>
                <p>A more exotic product of Guam at the time was pearls. Haswell was shown two Guam pearls, each half an inch in diameter. By the late nineteenth cen- tury, pearl diving in the Marianas disappeared, per- haps because of overharvesting on the islands’ small and fragile reef systems.</p>
                <p>It was under Governor Blanco that Captain Luis de Torres took passage on the American ship Maria under Captain Samuel William Boll when the Ma- ria was passing through Guam in 1804 on the way to the Caroline Islands in search of trepang. Luis de Torres wanted to discover why the Lamotrekese had never returned to Guam in 1789, as they had promised. When the Maria reached Woleai, Torres and the Carolinians agreed that a storm in 1789 must have wiped out the voyagers on their way back from Guam. With the mystery cleared up, Tor- res then invited the Carolinians to reestablish trade between the Carolines and Guam. The trading voy- ages resumed in 1805 with flotillas of up to eighteen oceangoing proas from the islands of Woleai, La- motrek, and Satawal.</p>
                <p>The interest of Luis de Torres in the Carolinian islanders was just one facet of a remarkable person- ality in a remarkable family. His grandfather, Joseph Miguel de Torres, had been assigned to Guam as an army officer in the late 1750s and brought his wife and children to the island. One son, Juan Francisco Regis de Torres, remained on Guam and became an army officer, marrying a Chamorro woman and serving until his death in 1803. Juan Regis de Torres</p>
                <p>85</p>
                <p>in turn was the father of Luis, who, like his father and grandfather, became an army officer (as a mes- tizo he could do so; men without Spanish ancestry were not given officer commissions).</p>
                <p>Luis de Torres was extolled by foreign visitors as an informed observer and protector of the Chamor- ro and Carolinian cultures. His career shows that life on Guam could be both personally rewarding and socially useful for the inquiring mind despite the remoteness and small size of the island. The Tor- res family remained prominent on Guam, and the descendants of Joseph Miguel de Torres are still ac- tive in business and civic affairs on the island.</p>
                <p>Governor Blanco was replaced in 1806 by Alex- andro Parrefio, who served until 1812. Under his tenure on Guam, Spain was again stumbling into a disastrous war, this time against France in 1808. As a consequence, all Spanish colonies were neglected even more than previously, leading to revolutions against Spain throughout Latin America from 1808 until 1824.</p>
                <p>These enormous events left distant Guam once more with little oversight by Manila, Mexico, and Madrid. With a completely free hand, Governor Parrefio turned out to be “a tyrant, whom they [the Marianos| never approached without trembling,” wrote the Russian visitor Otto von Kotzebue. The rapacious Parrefo earned a reputation for “insa- tiable cupidity,” according to Kotzebue, owing to his “excesses, disorders, crimes, licentiousness, adultery, seduction and betrayal of girls.” About the only accomplishment of Parrefio was to complete Fort Nuestra Sefiora de la Soledad. This fort with a battery of six cannons was perched on the south side of Umatac Bay on an imposing bluff called Chalan Aniti in Chamorro, the Path of the Ances- tors. It is now a popular tourist site.</p>
                <p>A new governor, José de Medinilla y Pineda, a dap- per bachelor army lieutenant, replaced Parrefio in 1812. Medinilla would serve until 1822 and then return to Guam to serve again from 1826 to 1831, a total of fifteen years, the longest service of any gov- ernor in Guam’s history. During that time, Spanish power was declining in the Pacific, but that decline</p>
                <p>86</p>
                <p>was the least of Madrid’s worries. The rising tide of revolution throughout Latin America was sweeping away the heart of Spain’s overseas empire. In late 1811, Mexican rebels in Acapulco seized the silver ready to be embarked on the galleon for Guam and Manila, leaving the Pacific colonies without situa- dos. The lifeline of Spanish silver across the Pacific was finally cut, not by European enemies, but by one of Spain’s own rebellious colonies</p>
                <p>In these conditions, the Manila governor-general discontinued the Manila to Acapulco voyages after the last two galleons departed Cavite in late 1811. By a cédula in September 1813, King Ferdinand VII ordered the Spanish galleon trade across the Pacific to cease. The appropriately named Magallanes de- parted Acapulco for Cavite in 1815, the last of the famed Spanish galleons to cross the Pacific. After that, all Spanish commercial ships out of Cavite with goods bound for Spain sailed across the Indian Ocean and around Africa to Cadiz.</p>
                <p>The Spanish galleon trade across the Pacific spanned 250 years from 1565 to 1815. It was one of the greatest maritime enterprises in human his- tory. A total of about forty ships were lost, of which some twenty vanished at unknown locations, These lost galleons inspired not only numerous treasure hunters over the years, but also legends and theo- ries that shipwrecked sailors on them married island women in Polynesia, including Hawai‘i, where they supposedly founded the line of nobles on the Big Is- land who would become the kings and queens of Hawai‘.</p>
                <p>It was in Governor Medinilla’s first term that an- other major shipwreck occurred at Guam. In Febru- ary 1814, the Infante Don Carlos, a frigate of the Royal Company and popularly known as the San- tiago, sailing from Callao, Peru, to Cavite by way of Guam, struck some coral heads of the Calalan Bank at the entrance to Apra Harbor. No one was injured in the wreck, and most of the valuable part of the cargo—500,000 Mexican silver pesos—was promptly salvaged. For salvage divers, the Span- iards employed Carolinians and Hawaiians who could free dive to considerable depths despite the absence of masks and fins at the time.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER 6</head>
                <p>By 1814, the Marianos of Guam had lost all the swimming skills of the old Chamorros. In the ac- count of his 1817 visit to Guam on the Kotzebue expedition soon after the wreck, the naturalist Adel- bert von Chamisso noted that “the present inhab- itants no longer know the sea, are not sailors, not swimmers anymore, and they have ceased to build boats.” When the Spaniards needed oceangoing canoes for interisland travel in the Marianas, they now purchased or chartered them from Carolinians, some of whom were remaining on Guam in between their annual trading voyages.</p>
                <p>Guam at this time needed all the trade it could attract since no situados or socorros had arrived be- tween 1810 and 1816 as a result of the revolution in Mexico. The Augustinian Order had let its pres- ence dwindle to just two friars on Guam. Owing to the shortage of priests, regular church services were held in only four villages: Agafia, Pago, Agat, and Umatac. The Rota church had been abandoned but would be revived by mid-century.</p>
                <p>As bad as the financial situation was, it became worse. In September 1817, King Ferdinand VII or- dered the annual situado for the Marianas reduced to only 8,000 pesos a year. The socorro appears to have been discontinued about the same time. That same year governmental supervision of the Philip- pines and the Marianas was removed from Mexico, by then no longer under Spanish control, and placed completely under Manila. The drastic shrinkage of the situado was caused principally by Spain’s loss of Mexico’s silver and by the enormous Spanish war debt. The result was an oversized and underfi- nanced government on Guam, a condition that be- came near permanent.</p>
                <p>Scientists, Whalers, and Distant Revolutions</p>
                <p>The end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe in 1816 brought about a surge in Russian and French scien- tific expeditions into the Pacific. The first of these to visit Guam arrived in late 1817 on a Russian Navy brig, the 180-ton Rurik, on an around-the-world voyage from 1815 to 1818 commanded by Otto Au- gust von Kotzebue. Aboard was the famous natural-</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>ist and author Count Adelbert von Chamisso. On Guam less than a week on his 1817 visit, Kotzebue would return to Guam in 1825 for a second short stop on the sloop Predpriatie on another circum- navigation in 1823-1826. Kotzebue added much to Europe’s hydrographic knowledge of the Pacific (he located over 400 small islands, many in Micronesia, previously unknown to outsiders), but he caused confusion with regard to Chamorro demographics. In his account of his 1817 visit to Guam he wrote, “There is only a man and his wife on the whole is- land, of the original branch [of Chamorros]. With the death of these two people the race of the old Ladrones will be entirely extinguished.”</p>
                <p>Kotzebue did not know Spanish and depended on the multilingual Chamisso as interpreter, so per- haps he misunderstood what the Spaniards told him of the Chamorros. In any case, his statement was wrong. Chamisso gave a different picture of the couple whom Kotzebue thought were the last Chamorros: “In Agafia when we were there, a ro- bust old man aged 86 and four months was living still with his equally aged wife. Around them were no less than 135 descendants, down to the sixth generation.”</p>
                <p>Elsewhere in his accounts, Kotzebue provided figures of the official Spanish census for 1816 that showed 2,559 Chamorro indios on Guam, Rota, and Tinian, or nearly half the total population of 5,389 people. A significant number of these in- dios were likely to have still been of pure Chamor- ro ethnicity. In particular, the 451 indios on Rota, an island Kotzebue did not visit, were mostly pure Chamorros as of 1816 because of minuscule immi- gration to Rota by non-Chamorros. On his 1819 visit to the Marianas, Captain Louis Claude De- saulses de Freycinet noted that the indigenous Cha- morro race “has maintained itself best on Rota, where, until our time, are still found true examples of the ancient types.”</p>
                <p>In the mid-1850s, Governor Felipe de la Corte would report that Chamorros of “pure race,” in his words, still numbered 600 persons in the Marianas. In 1889, the French visitor Antoine-Alfred Marche, who spent the years 1887-1889 in the Marianas,</p>
                <p>87</p>
                <p>noted that there were still “pure blooded indigenes on Guam....It is perhaps possible to find a few in Rota. There, only about fifteen families may rep- resent what is left of pure blooded indigenes.” As late as 1900, on an American military inspection of Guam, Major General Joseph Wheeler observed, “I saw a few people who I was informed were pure Chamorros, and they impressed me very favorably.” Kotzebue’s false assumption in 1817 that the Cha- morros would soon be “extinguished,” a conclu- sion given credence in Europe and America through the popular accounts of his voyages, did a disservice to the Chamorros. They have been far more durable than Kotzebue and other visitors imagined.</p>
                <p>Kotzebue’s 1817 visit to Guam was soon followed by two more Russian visits of short duration: the first under Vasilii Mikhailovich Golovnin in late November 1818, the second by Leontii Adrianovich von Hagemeister two months later in early 1819. Golovnin found that the old antiforeign attitudes of the Spaniards were changing with the more frequent arrivals of non-Spanish ships. He wrote, “For sev- eral years now, foreign shipping has been increas- ing in quest of fresh water and victuals; and when a foreign ship appears, the natives have a festival, for they get a good payment, in money or in kind, for their products.”</p>
                <p>After the Russians, the next significant visitors to the Marianas were members of the French expedi- tion under Louis de Freycinet on the 350-ton cor- vette Uranie. This government-sponsored expedi- tion around the world, like all others from this time forward, was not for exploration to discover islands (most had already been located by the Europeans) but to gather scientific data. The Freycinet expedi- tion had already visited Australia and Timor prior to reaching Guam. In Timor, the crew suffered from malaria and dysentery, so Guam once more served as a recuperative oasis for sailors sick and battered from crossing great stretches of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>The Uranie anchored in March 1819 off Umatac Bay and remained nearly four months. Because of the long duration of the visit and owing to French intellectual curiosity, members of the Freycinet ex-</p>

                <p>pedition compiled one of the most thorough sci- entific and historical descriptions of Guam of any visitors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some of this information was based on the histories by Garcia and Le Gobien, but it was greatly ampli- fied by data from interviews with Chamorros and Spaniards on Guam, particularly Luis de Torres.</p>
                <p>The first thing that struck the French visitors about Guam in 1819 in comparison with other Pa- cific islands that they had visited was the great pov- erty of the Chamorros. Rose Pinon de Freycinet, wife of the commander, was poignant in her description of Chamorros at Ypao village on Tumon Bay when Governor Medinilla took the French party to visit the site of San Vitores’ martyrdom: “The strange- ness, and above all the miserable conditions of the inhabitants astonished us, in view of the richness of the vegetation and the ease with which healthy food can be obtained with little work.”</p>
                <p>Despite the poverty of the people, one of the ex- pedition’s artists, Jacques Arago, noted, “Music is one of the most agreeable amusements of the inhab- itants of the Mariannes; they sing the moment they awake, they sing during the hours of rest, and they fall asleep singing.”</p>
                <p>The amorous Arago found the girls of Guam to be among the most attractive of all Pacific island women he met. The island women were readily available for sex, and he claimed several seductions. Arago attributed the loose sexual behavior of the Chamorros, both men and women alike, to the ca- sual attitudes of the Augustinians: “Nowhere, per- haps, is there so much and so little religion as at Guam.”</p>
                <p>The Frenchmen noted that the Chamorros con- tinued much of the indigenous folklore and tradi- tional Chamorro customs but mixed them with those of the Spaniards and Filipinos. An example was the Chamorro practice of breathing, or simulat- ing a kiss, called mannginge‘, on the cheek or the back of the hand of an older person as a sign of respect and courtesy.</p>
                <p>Louis de Freycinet provided the first written ac- count of a popular legend on Guam of two lovers who committed suicide by jumping from a towering</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>seaside cliff—Puntan de los dos Amantes, or Two Lovers Point—on the north side of Tumon Bay. Ac- cording to Freycinet’s informants, the tragedy took place before the arrival of the Spaniards. The young man was a high-caste chamorri matua who fell in love with a lovely but low-caste manachang maid- en. Refused permission to marry by their families because of their caste difference, they were exiled from their villages. In despair, the lovers jumped together to their deaths from the great cliff. Since Freycinet’s time the tale has changed: in a later ver- sion, the Chamorro girl was betrothed by her fam- ily to a Spanish captain, who became enraged when he learned that she loved a Chamorro youth. In despair, the two Chamorros tied the locks of their long black hair together and leaped to their deaths in each other’s arms from the cliff.</p>
                <p>At the time of Freycinet’s visit in 1819, the Span- ish mission and garrison were in a deep economic de- pression as a consequence of the drastic reduction of the situado. Freycinet wrote that Guam’s economy was “stagnating” in a “state of torpor.” According to his account, packs of destructive semiwild dogs roamed the island. Descendants of these animals, now called “boonie dogs,” still roam free on Guam today, impervious to the attempts of the Spanish and American governments to eradicate them.</p>
                <p>One accomplishment of the Freycinet expedition was a hydrographic survey of all the Marianas. This was published in 1826 with a folio atlas by Lieuten- ant Louis Isidore Duperrey of Freycinet’s staff. The survey was the basis of later Spanish maps and a publication, Derrotero de las Islas Marianas (Navi- gational data for the Mariana Islands), by the Span- ish Hydrographic Office in 1863, which in turn was the basis of American maps in the early twentieth century.</p>
                <p>By the 1820s, whalers were beginning to stop in the Mariana Islands. The first recorded American whaler in the Marianas had been the New England ship Ann cand Hope at Tinian in 1798. She was fol- lowed by the Resource in 1799, which stopped at Guam, where the thirsty whalers were welcomed by the Spaniards and the impoverished Marianos.</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>Captains of whaling ships came to Guam for wood, water, and provisions; the crews came for women, tuba, and aguardiente. The results were predictable: drunken brawls, desertions by disgruntled crewmen, and the spread of the “pox” (venereal diseases, not smallpox) among the Chamorros until whaling de- clined after the American Civil War.</p>
                <p>Local authorities and whalers were surprised in early March 1825 when a Spanish squadron of three men-of-war and a supply ship anchored off Umatac Bay on their way from Peru to the Philip- pines. Aboard were peninsular officers who had been released by South American insurgents after the defeat of the Spanish armies at the battle of Aya- cucho, Peru, in December 1824. That decisive battle resulted in the final loss of all Spain’s colonies in South America. As a consequence, many peninsular officers were being transferred to Spain’s remaining colonies. These peninsulares, all born in Spain, took precedence over local officers so that, for instance, a lieutenant from Spain ranked above a criollo or mestizo major born in the colonies. The same racial privileges applied among priests.</p>
                <p>This discriminatory ranking caused much resent- ment against the peninsulares and in Manila sparked a brief but bloody revolt in June 1823 led by a crio- Ilo captain, Andrés Novales. Although the authori- ties suppressed the rebellion and executed Novales, the incident created fears among the Spanish penin- sulares of conspiracies by criollos and locals against loyalist authorities. Spain itself was in political tur- moil between conservative loyalists, who supported the despotic King Ferdinand VII, and liberals, who had forced the king to accept a liberal constitution in 1820.</p>
                <p>It was in this climate of suspicion that the naval squadron from Peru arrived at Umatac in March 1825. The crews and soldiers aboard the vessels were mostly criollos and mestizos from South Amer- ica. They planned to take advantage of the stop at Umatac to seize the ships before they reached the still loyalist Philippines.</p>
                <p>On the night of March 10, the crews and soldiers on the warships rose in mutiny and arrested all the officers. The supply ship was burned and sank. The</p>
                <p>89</p>
                <p>governor at the time, José Ganga Herrero, although a liberal, was unable to talk the rebels out of the mu- tiny and was afraid of attempting to retake the ships with his feeble local forces. The ships’ officers and other peninsulares were taken ashore and subse- quently departed on two whaling vessels to Manila. The victorious mutineers sailed two of the men-of- war to Mexico, while the other ended up in Chile.</p>
                <p>The people of Guam were passive onlookers to these events since the Marianos were so isolated from outside news they had not yet been infected by liberal politics. When the news of the mutiny reached Manila, the authorities there removed Gov- ernor Ganga. The busy Ganga was popular with the people of Guam. He had allowed free trade with non-Spanish ships and had made legitimate his chil- dren born out of wedlock on Guam. Spaniards of- ten fathered children by island mistresses, but few officials bothered to make these children legitimate under Spanish law by formally giving them the man’s family name in official records.</p>
                <p>In July 1826, Ganga’s replacement arrived. He turned out to be José de Medinilla, the former gov- ernor and staunch loyalist, who had been reappoint- ed after King Ferdinand VII revoked the liberal con- stitution in Spain in 1823. Medinilla, a conservative of the old order who had squeezed money from the Chamorros, was not popular on Guam. So at the change-of-command ceremony in Agafa in July 1826, Medinilla canceled all twba debts owed by the people and allowed aguardiente to be distilled with- out payment of a license fee. These gestures defused the discontent, but only temporarily.</p>
                <p>Into this less than tranquil scene in the Marianas sailed another foreign scientific expedition, that of the Russian Ferdinand Petrovich von Litke, with two ships. They anchored at Apra February 15, 1828, and would depart three weeks later. Liitke had been with Golovnin on Guam back in 1818 and happily renewed his acquaintance with Gov- ernor Medinilla and Luis de Torres. The ever-gra- cious Torres provided his farm on Orote Peninsula for the Russian scientists to set up an astronomical observatory.</p>
                <p>90</p>
                <p>Members of the Russian party, like the French visitors, deplored the impact of Spanish rule on the islanders; the visitors compared the submis- sive Chamorros unfavorably with the still tradi- tional and free Carolinians. Lutke also deplored the many white “tramps” he observed roaming around Guam. These were mostly runaway whalers.</p>
                <p>Lutke was followed to Guam by yet another sci- entific expedition, this one from France under the command of Jules Sébastien César Dumont d’Urville in the corvette Astrolabe. The Astrolabe anchored at Umatac for four weeks in 1828 while thirty-six seriously sick sailors recovered ashore. Dumont d’Urville, like Litke, found a sizable expatriate</p>

The port pilot was by then a Scot, John Anderson, who had come with Freycinet and stayed, marry- ing Maria de Castro and raising twelve children. A Frenchman, Juan Roberto, was the pilot of the governor’s schooner and had married a Chamorrita (chamorrita originally meant a love song, and kan- tan chamorrita are improvised folk songs in Cha- morro in rhyming couplets still sung on Guam; in the 1800s the word “Chamorrita” came to mean a young woman of Chamorro origin).</p>

                <p>years later when on New Year’s Day 1839 Dumont d’Urville again halted at Guam in the Astrolabe, this time with an escort, the 300-ton corvette Zelée, on another circumnavigation that would penetrate to the continent of Antarctica. In his accounts of his voyages, Dumont d’Urville was the first to popular- ize the division of the Pacific world into three major ethnographic regions—Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia—a division that oversimplified the cultur- al complexities of Oceania but one that nonetheless endured.</p>

                <p>century scientific expeditions into the Pacific that paused in the Marianas. By then, the Spaniards had attempted a number of reforms in the Marianas un- der a Spanish officer whose good intentions were similar to those of Mariano Tobias of the century before but whose efforts to help the Chamorros would be just as ineffective.</p>
                <p>Captain Villalobos</p>
                <p>After the loss of most of the Spanish colonies in Lat- in America and following the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne in 1823, Spanish loyalists became</p>
                <p>92</p>
                <p>more attentive to the need to improve the defens- es and governments of the remaining colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. As before, the Marianas figured in these concerns because of their strategic location as a link to the Philippines. In 1828, Madrid ordered Manila to improve securi- ty and administration on Guam. Several plans were debated before one proposed by Ganga Herrero, then assigned to the military staff in Manila, was approved by Governor-General Mariano Ricafort Palacin y Abarca.</p>
                <p>Ganga’s plan was approved because it was the cheapest. Under it, the Marianas were to cost the crown only 6,424 pesos a year in place of the 8,000 pesos then budgeted. In December 1828, Ricafort promulgated Ganga’s plan as an edict (Bando de Ricafort) with thirteen orders to Governor Medini- lla on Guam. The most significant orders were (1) the creation of an “urban militia”; (2) the redistri- bution of unused crown lands to Marianos; (3) the elimination of the governor’s monopoly over com- merce; (4) the opening of the Marianas to trade and of Apra and Umatac as free ports; and (5) the cre- ation of a new position, administrator of the royal treasury, who would handle finances of the situado to be sent every two years from Manila.</p>
                <p>While these steps were being planned in Manila, Madrid also decided to look carefully at Guam at the Council of the Indies level. This resulted in a special report in 1828 titled Memoria sobre las Ys- las Marianas, the first of an endless line of studies by the Spanish and American governments over the next 175 years that proposed much and produced little for the people of the Mariana Islands or for Spain.</p>
                <p>When the Memoria was being prepared, the Spanish government requested the Society of Jesus to send ten Jesuits to Guam to replace the Augus- tinians, who at the time had only one Spanish Rec- ollect and one Filipino secular priest on the island. The Jesuits declined because of a shortage of priests. Madrid then made the same request of the Fran- ciscans, but they too declined for the same reason. Ironically, the two religious orders that had brought about the conversion of the Chamorros were unable</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>to return to reinvigorate the Christian faith in the people whose destiny they had once been so deter- mined to shape.</p>
                <p>Spanish insecurity about Guam was confirmed on May 17, 1829, when a coup was attempted in Aga- fia against Governor Medinilla. This small rebellion was apparently initiated by expatriates and did not spark a general uprising by the Marianos. The dis- turbance was quickly suppressed without bloodshed but left Spanish authorities in Agafia and Manila nervous. In reaction, Ricafort appointed a young bachelor captain of artillery, Francisco Ramon de Villalobos, to head a mission to improve Guam’s defenses against external and internal threats.</p>
                <p>It took two ships to transport Villalobos and a large amount of supplies and armaments to Guam. In August 1829, the ships arrived at Apra, where Governor Medinilla, now middle aged and a lieu- tenant colonel, received the Villalobos mission with proper protocol. By January 1830, Villalobos had sent several long reports to Manila full of propos- als to improve the defenses and the economy of the Marianas. The outcome was that in September 1831 Villalobos replaced Medinilla as governor.</p>
                <p>Manila, however, sent no new funds, so addition- al forts for defense were never built; supplies still only trickled into Guam; the colegio was closed (it would reopen later); and education and religious observances remained inadequate since only a hand- ful of new priests came to the island. Some reforms did help the Chamorros; for example, a number of families received land grants from the limited break- up of excess crown lands.</p>
                <p>The reduction of the island’s subsidy in conse- quence of the Ricafort reforms had an impact on de- mographics in the Marianas. As the situado shrunk, any payments that had to be made in cash became a burden to the increasingly cashless residents. Span- iards, mestizos, and foreigners still paid taxes (such as a 10 percent tax on farm produce) and license fees in cash as in the past. Equally burdensome, they had to pay cash for the obligatory church tithes and other ecclesiastical charges for marriages, baptisms, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Payment of these charges, except for some church</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>fees, applied to everyone except Chamorros. There- fore, mestizos, Filipinos, and others on Guam began to list their newborn children, and themselves where possible, as indios in church and official records to avoid payment of cash charges. One outcome of these claims to be indios (a categorization previous- ly despised by non-Chamorros) was to resurrect the dormant issue of Chamorro identity, the idea of a distinctive Chamorro grassroots presence as some- thing of value for the islanders. This idea would re- turn to haunt later Spanish authorities.</p>
                <p>In October 1837, the administration of the good Captain Villalobos ended, and he was transferred back to Manila to continue his military career. Nearly every one of the thirteen reforms ordered in the 1828 Bando de Ricafort fell short of its intended effect. In 1839, on his return visit to Guam, Du- mont d’Urville sadly commented in what could be an epitaph to Villalobos and other well-intentioned Spanish governors who tried to fulfill their duties in the Marianas but failed: “It was noticeable that Guam had gone downhill for ten years...the island was poverty stricken. The inhabitants, ravaged by leprosy, lived in filthy huts among beautiful orange groves.”</p>
                <p>Earthquakes, Consuls, and Convicts</p>
                <p>The governors who followed Villalobos over the next ten years were José Casillas Salazar (1837- 1843), an alcoholic; Gregorio de Santa Maria (1843-1848), kindly and popular, and who died of an “apoplexy” stroke on Guam; and Félix Calvo y Noriega, elected by local officials to serve as interim governor from April to September 1848. Calvo was the administrator of the treasury. A peninsular, he founded one of Guam’s elite mestizo manak‘kilo families still prominent on Guam today.</p>
                <p>In his brief tenure as governor, Félix Calvo enter- tained another French visit from June into August 1848, that of Jean Edmund Jurien de la Graviére on the ship Bayonnaise. The French captain took refuge on Guam with his ship to avoid British war- ships (Britain was hostile against France owing to the 1848 French Revolution). Like Freycinet and</p>
                <p>93</p>
                <p>Dumont d’Urville, Jurien de la Graviére was critical of the Spanish administration and its destructive im- pact on the Chamorros. He wrote, “It is astonishing to see the swift ravages that primitive peoples suf- fer upon contact with our civilization....Perhaps a day will come when they are called to a more noble destiny without violating the designs of Providence. But today let us not carelessly bring them new suf- fering; let us not try their naive faith; let us respect their calm bliss.”</p>
                <p>With little oversight by Madrid and Manila in this period, the conservative governors and administra- tors of the treasury on Guam once more worked out ways to squeeze personal profits from the system. The governor prevented anyone other than himself from importing goods on the government-chartered Cavite ship, thus blocking competition. Goods were still sold at huge markups in the government store (reopened despite the Bando de Ricafort), as in the old days, but now under the administrator’s control. The governor and the administrator then shared the profits.</p>
                <p>A prime source of income and trade goods on Guam in the 1840s was still from the sales of pro- visions, aquardiente, entertainment, and sex to the whalers who called at Apra Harbor. Up to sixty whaling ships a year stopped at Apra Harbor, often remaining weeks. In trade with the whalers many Chamorros learned English, which became the third main language on the island. The former Torres farm at Sume grew into the thriving little port town of Sumay. Spanish authorities were strict with the whalers. The log of the Emily Morgan, an Ameri- can whaler that visited Guam many times, described Spanish control: “By the laws of the island, every white man or foreigner must have a boarding-house, and be within doors at eight P.M....If any are ab- sent from their respective houses they are found and marched home; and should they be saucy, or show belligerent spirits, off they go to the calaboose.”</p>
                <p>Whaling was beginning to decline when a new governor, Pablo Pérez, arrived on Guam in 1848. Pérez’ job was made more difficult than usual be- cause of natural disasters: Guam and the Carolines had been battered by three typhoons in 1847; an-</p>
                <p>94</p>
                <p>other struck in June 1848; and yet another swept through Micronesia, this time a supertyphoon, on August 10-12 the same year. The August storm resulted in three boatloads of Carolinian refugees sailing to the Marianas, where Pérez allowed them to settle. As if these calamities were not enough, in January 1849 a whaling ship from Hawai‘i brought an influenza epidemic that killed over 200 persons on Guam, mostly young women.</p>
                <p>The influenza was followed on January 25 by a severe earthquake on Guam with days of after- shocks. Massive rock slides crashed off the cliffs all around the island; big cracks opened and then closed in the ground, and most roofs fell in. The new tower on the church in Agafia collapsed, and the old colegio nearly crumbled. In Umatac, the pa- lacio, the San Dionisio Church, and the convento (the priests’ residence) were practically demolished. Only the church was rebuilt and of wood, not coral masonry.</p>
                <p>The earthquake of 1849 also caused disastrous tidal waves that swept over the atolls of Satawal, Lamotrek, and other Carolinian islands. In April, several canoes arrived at Guam from those islands with emaciated Carolinians who told of widespread death and destruction from the tsunamis. Pablo Pérez again permitted the Carolinians to settle in the Marianas, this time mostly on Saipan. Condi- tions worsened on Guam when a plague of worms consumed most crops in the rainy season. Pérez ap- pealed to Manila for help, and funds and supplies were quickly dispatched.</p>
                <p>When conditions were back to normal after a few years, Governor Pérez was surprised in November 1854 by the unexpected arrival of an American consul and his secretary, the first to be assigned to Guam. Samuel J. Masters was an itinerant Ameri- can who had been a U.S. consul in British Guyana, a ship captain, and a police magistrate in the whaling port of Lahaina on Maui in the Hawaiian Islands. A fellow American, Josiah S. Van Ingen, joined him as secretary. Masters and Van Ingen obtained per- mission in Manila to travel to Guam, but the Span- ish officials, suspicious of American agents, never granted formal approval for Masters’ consular au-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>thority. Masters and Van Ingen nonetheless headed off to Agafia.</p>
                <p>On Guam, Masters showed the newcomer syn- drome often seen in Pacific islands whereby the re- cent foreign arrival has immediate insight on how to solve local problems, if people would only listen. As a consequence, he was soon in a dispute with Pérez over his consular authority and with American ship captains over crew matters. A major concern in his sixteen-month stay on Guam was the case of the American merchant ship Sarah Mooers. This bark ran aground on Ngatik Atoll in the Carolines in late 1853. Twenty-nine survivors were kept almost as prisoners by Governor Pérez on Guam for several months. Masters interceded vigorously in Manila on behalf of his countrymen and helped obtain the release of a few still remaining on Guam when he arrived.</p>
                <p>The governor-general in Manila solved the squab- bles between Pablo Pérez and Masters by replacing Pérez with a new governor, Felipe Maria de la Corte y Ruano Calderon, who arrived on Guam in May 1855. The new governor received a shock when the USS Vandalia, the first American warship to visit Guam, sailed unexpectedly into Apra Harbor in July 1855. Its mission was to reprimand the Span- iards for holding the survivors of the Sarah Mooers. After negotiations with Masters and Commander John Pope of the Vandalia under the guns of the warship, Governor de la Corte apologized on behalf of the Spanish government.</p>
                <p>The appearance of the Vandalia was evidence of new geopolitical conditions in the rim lands around the Pacific Ocean that would dramatically affect insular areas in Oceania. California had become a territory of the United States as a result of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Discovery of gold in California in 1848 spurred a massive shift in American interest toward the Pacific. Japan be- gan to emerge from its feudal samurai cocoon when Commodore Matthew Perry, backed by four U.S. warships, concluded the first Japanese-American trade treaty with the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1854.</p>
                <p>Micronesia was being penetrated by non-Span-</p>

                <p>ish traders and non-Catholic missionaries. In the 1840s, the English trader Andrew Cheyne set up trading stations in Palau. In 1852, evangelical Prot- estants from the United States established missions on Kosrae and Pohnpei, and, in 1857, the American ship Morning Star brought a Protestant mission to Ebon in the Marshall Islands. German copra traders soon followed in the Marshalls.</p>
                <p>While more nations encroached on the former Spanish lake of the Pacific, Spain was economically depressed and preoccupied with domestic power struggles. The lack of funds forced Manila to halt the Guam situado in 1855. The end of a regular subsidy plunged Guam’s budgets into a deficit that would continue under the remainder of Spanish rule despite the temporary reinstitution of the situado later. Governor de la Corte wrote prophetically, “We beg our readers to never lose sight of this defi- cit, which will grow...and never drop.”</p>
                <p>All these misfortunes faded into insignificance, however, in the face of one of the greatest disasters in Guam’s history: the massive smallpox epidemic of 1856.</p>
                <p>Smallpox and Political Exiles</p>
                <p>In late February 1856, when the American mer- chant schooner Edward L. Frost arrived at Apra from Manila, it was quarantined only three days before releasing passengers despite a man aboard having died of smallpox and been buried at sea just before the Frost reached Guam. Two passengers from influential Guam families—Silvestre Francis- co Palomo and Francisco Tudela—were permitted to go ashore immediately on Guam. Palomo and Tudela both soon sickened and died in May. The disease spread despite efforts by the Spaniards to isolate the infected and to vaccinate people. Father Aniceto Ibafiez del Carmen described the epidemic: “In the beginning the victims were from Agafia only. By the end of August it had spread with the speed of lightning—like an electric spark—to all the vil- lages of the island. The picture the island presented in September was horrible, sad, deplorable, and heart-breaking.”</p>
                <p>95</p>
                <p>By November 1856, the smallpox had disap- peared, but so had 5,534 people of all ages, or over 60 percent of the entire population of 8,775 on Guam before the dreadful epidemic. Since the ma- jority of the dead were of Chamorro ancestry, the 1856 epidemic affected generations of Chamorros. One example was the death of Silvestre Palomo (whose wife was the daughter of Luis de Torres), in consequence of which his son, José Bernardo Palomo y Torres, entered the priesthood. He was ordained a secular priest by the bishop at Cebu in 1859, the first with Chamorro ancestry (the origi- nal Palomo on Guam was a Mexican criollo who married a Chamorrita), Padre Palomo would serve throughout the Marianas into the twentieth century with distinction.</p>
                <p>In 1857, the governor-general in Manila received a royal order to establish a prison in the Marianas for civilian convicts (confinados). Governor de la Corte transformed the old barracks of the Agafia presidio into a prison, and in 1858 sixty-three Chi- nese civilian convicts from the Philippines arrived, all of whom were sent back to Manila when they turned out to be “vicious, extremely weak, and sick,” in the words of de la Corte. The governor dis- approved of Madrid’s efforts to make Guam into a penal colony. Despite his objections, a royal order in 1860 set up a new prison system, and Manila would dump convicts of all kinds in the Marianas and else- where in Micronesia in the coming decades.</p>
                <p>Felipe de la Corte, a lieutenant colonel in the army engineers, was a perceptive man, and in 1865 he au- thored one of the most thorough descriptions of the Marianas written by any Spanish official. The book, Memoria descriptiva é historica de las Islas Mari- anas, was published by the Spanish government in 1875 and contained numerous recommendations. None of de la Corte’s proposals were put into effect except one that urged the establishment of Spanish missions and government posts in Yap (created in 1886) and Pohnpei (set up in 1887).</p>
                <p>One suggestion by de la Corte was that the Cha- morros be dissuaded from eating federico nuts. Called fadang in Chamorro and Cycas circinalis by scientists, federico is a cycad, a kind of primitive</p>
                <p>96</p>
                <p>palm that looks like a fern tree and bears large nut- like seeds that are poisonous. The people of Guam detoxify the nuts by soaking and boiling them. They then grind them into flour to make tortillas, which have a taste distinctive from corn flour tortillas.</p>
                <p>De la Corte recommended that federico nuts not be eaten because he believed they caused “endemic illnesses which have become hereditary and produce the elephanteasis illness, often causing premature aging and short life.” The Spaniards later called the illness paralytico, or lytico for short, and Chamor- ros called it bodig, which came from the Spanish word bodega (store), where people bought medicine for the illness. No one followed de la Corte’s ad- vice since no one could prove fadang caused lyti- co-bodig. A later governor, Luis de Ibafiez y Gar- cia (1871-1873), did not mention lytico-bodig in his book, Historia de las Islas Marianas, published in Spain in 1886, even though the disease was still present in the Marianas.</p>
                <p>By the 1870s, Madrid was again convulsed by se- rious internal political troubles. With each change in Spain’s government, supporters of the previous regime were arrested and deported as political con- victs—deportados—to the colonies. Governmental upheavals in turn provoked reform movements in the colonies by mestizos, criollos, and locals against the privileges of the Spanish peninsular officials and priests. In the Philippines, reformists sparked the small but symbolically important Cavite Mutiny of January 1872 led by Filipino priests. The Spaniards brutally crushed the mutiny and executed three priests (one was eighty-three years old). Numerous Filipinos were tried in secret and sentenced to politi- cal exile as deportados.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of the mutinies and revolts, 1,200 political exiles from Spain and the Philippines as well as additional ordinary convicts (called pre- sidiarios because they were imprisoned in the Agafia presidio) ended up in the Marianas from 1872 to 1877. The deportados were often not imprisoned, since it was difficult to escape from the island, and they lived among the island people. There were so many convicts and deportados on Guam that the notorious American blackbirder (he kidnapped is-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>landers for labor gangs on other Pacific islands) and sometimes pirate William Henry (Bully) Hayes went into business to smuggle them off Guam at $24.00 per head in his schooner Arabia. Hayes was arrested on Guam in April 1875 and sent off to prison in Manila. By mid-1875, Guam was so full of convicts that, when the steamer Patino arrived with 473 de- portados, they were all sent to Saipan.</p>
                <p>In June 1876 King Alfonzo XII freed all deporta- dos, and most were repatriated, leaving mainly or- dinary civilian and military convicts in the Marian- as. Most of these convicts, with little money for ship fares, stayed on Guam when they completed their sentences and were freed. Many married local wom- en and raised families. However, the deportados, particularly educated Filipinos with radical political ideas of “native rights,” had a subversive impact on the Chamorros among whom they lived. One histo- rian wrote of the Filipinos, “There never ceased to exist a secret revolutionary agitation which culmi- nated in the events of 1898.”</p>
                <p>Spanish officials on Guam appear to have under- estimated the influence of the new political ideas among the heretofore docile Chamorros. On the evening of August 2, 1884, as Governor Angel de Pazos y Vela-Hidalgo entered the palacio on his way to dinner, the guard at the entrance saluted and then shot him in the back as he passed, killing him al- most instantly.</p>
                <p>The guard was a _ twenty-year-old Chamorro named José de Salas. He fled to hide behind the co- legio while the sargento mayor, Captain Antonio Borreda y Arlares, immediately called out all the other local soldiers, coolly inspected them, secured all their ammunition, and relieved them from duty. All the Spaniards and principales then armed them- selves and gathered their families in the palacio, but a feared uprising by the Chamorros did not take place. The next day the assassin turned himself in and Pazos was buried in the Agafia cemetery.</p>
                <p>The authorities first thought that the killing was out of personal resentment at the unpopular Pazos, but a preliminary investigation revealed a conspira- cy among soldiers of the local guard company, near- ly all Chamorros, to overthrow the government.</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>Father Francisco Resano del Corazon de Jesus, who administered the last rites to Pazos, wrote, “Their plans had been to kill the governor first, then all the Spaniards, and some of the principales of Agafia— and then they would do whatever seemed best.”</p>
                <p>News of the event did not reach Manila for weeks, until a boat sailed from Guam to Yap to in- form the Spanish trading post there, and the Yap- based schooner Bartola arrived at Cavite in Oc- tober. The governor-general dispatched troops to Guam under Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Olive y Garcia, who was made the new governor. The investigation lasted into 1885, when forty-seven suspects, all local soldiers, were sent to Manila for trial. Since the Guam guard company totaled only fifty to sixty troops, almost all the soldiers who guarded the palacio and the Agafia presidio build- ings were implicated. The new governor disbanded the local company and replaced it with a regular in- fantry company of Filipino soldiers under Spanish and mestizo officers.</p>
                <p>In Manila at a military trial, twelve of the sus- pects were found innocent, thirty-one were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms, and four were found guilty and sentenced to death. All were then returned to Guam. In April 1885, the four sentenced to death were shot on the beach at Agafia by a firing squad.</p>
                <p>The Spanish authorities treated the murder of Pa- zos as a political crime, that is, “a conspiracy for rebellion.” Years later, Father José Palomo made a different judgment from the local viewpoint when he wrote, “Don Antonio Borreda, who became Governor ad interim, endeavored to profit by this murder, trying to win promotion by making it ap- pear a private act of an individual was the result of an insurrection, and to accomplish this he had several people imprisoned who, under torture, were made to testify.”</p>
                <p>The Spanish End Game</p>
                <p>Regardless of where the truth was in the motiva- tion for Pazos’ murder, Guam was never again se- cure for Spain. As late as 1894, the Spanish naval</p>
                <p>97</p>
                <p>officer Luis Cadarso y Rey, who was governor of the Caroline Islands, noted on a visit to Guam that Spaniards had to be on guard against Chamorros. This distinctive Chamorro identity was demonstrat- ed by the fact that Marianos still spoke the Chamor- ro language among themselves. The perseverance of the indigenous language was remarkable. By the 1890s, the people of the Marianas had lost much of their precontact culture, but the soft and musical Chamorro language was, and remains today, true to its roots. An American linguist later noted, “While Spanish may have left a lasting mark on Chamorro vocabulary, as it did on many Philippine and South American languages, it had virtually no effect on Chamorro grammar.”</p>
                <p>The Chamorro language was maintained primar- ily through maternal control of family life (si nana in Chamorro), an arrangement with precontact roots compatible with Catholicism’s veneration of Mary. Most mixtures of outsiders with Chamorros originated when foreign men fathered children with local women of Chamorro ancestry. In a process of religious genius the Catholic Church transformed the Chamorros from children of women used by aliens to children of the Christian Virgin. This pow- erful integrative religious impulse served not only to reconcile Chamorros with foreigners, it also helped to preserve the Chamorro identity. Although fathers were the heads of families and bilingualism was of- ten practiced, the Mariano mothers raised the chil- dren to speak Chamorro in the home, regardless of the father’s language, and thereby passed on the Chamorro heritage by word of mouth.</p>
                <p>The family in Chamorro society under the Span- iards was strengthened by local acceptance of Span- ish Catholic marriage rites and godparent obser- vances (compadrazzo in Spanish; in Chamorro, compare, or pare/kumpaire, for godfather and co- mare for godmother). By the nineteenth century, a church marriage was an indissoluble bond unlike precontact marriage practices. The roles and obliga- tions of godparents were formalized as kinship ties through baptism and confirmation, thereby extend- ing families and making them and the church the centers of social loyalty rather than civic attachment</p>

                <p>to a distant and alien Spain. This pare system based on strong familial ties between natural parents and godparents (those of baptism and those of confir- mation) would be carried into politics after World War II, often resulting in factionalism and rivalries between extended families in electoral politics.</p>
                <p>The absorption of introduced customs demon- strated how the Chamorros were not just passive subjects of the Spaniards, as many European visi-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>tors thought, but agents of their own transforma- tion. The Chamorros, particularly the women, manipulated alien systems for their own purposes, adopting new concepts and practices to meet local needs while holding to the core of their language and control of family. Largely by means of this language-family linkage and because Guam was a poor and isolated island, the Chamorros were nei- ther totally Hispanicized nor replaced by a hybrid</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>nonindigenous population, as occurred in Cuba and Puerto Rico. Instead, the Chamorros absorbed immigrants into a neo-Chamorro society with new attributes but still permeated by a distinctive univo- cal Chamorro consciousness at the grassroots level. This process would continue after the Americans re- placed the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>The people of Guam also showed a taste for irony and indeterminism manifested, for example, in a gen- eral indifference to planning and financial account- ing or to the accumulation of cash. As elsewhere in the Spanish empire, laws and regulations imposed by distant authorities were often ignored or evaded. This “live for now” attitude, often demonstrated as a calm fatalism (which was not laziness or a manana outlook, as some visitors mistakenly thought), may have derived from Guam’s long, involuntary legacy of devastating typhoons, earthquakes, epidemics, and the imposition of alien values.</p>
                <p>The Chamorro attitude of chastened rebellious- ness is illustrated in the many humorous stories about the legendary Juan Malo (John the Mischie- vous) and his carabao under Spanish rule. In these folk tales, the lowly Chamorro youth Juan Malo, a trickster and the people’s hero, gets back at the all-powerful Spanish officials through his wit. The confrontation between the poor but clever Juan Malo on his stolid carabao and the rich but dumb Spanish governor on his haughty horse became an enduring symbol in local folklore of the Spanish era on Guam.</p>
                <p>In real life, Governor Olive y Garcia was a smart, hard-working army officer. In 1884, he demolished the old Agafia palacio and started construction on the site of a more spacious residence that would take until 1889 to complete. Olive published Islas Marianas: Lijeros Apuntes (The Mariana Islands: Random Notes) in Manila in 1887. In his book, Ol- ive gave the population for the Marianas as of De- cember 1886 as 9,770, of whom 8,618 were listed as Chamorros. Most locals, regardless of ancestry, were lumped into the Chamorro category, which by then was mostly of mixed ethnicity. Guam’s popu- lation was 8,199, with 6,255 (76 percent) concen-</p>
                <p>99</p>
                <p>trated in Agafia alone. Olive noted that everyone on Guam had become “Chamorrized” to avoid taxes.</p>
                <p>According to Olive, Guam’s schools were so poor that students “wrote with little sticks on banana leaves.” Nearly 90 percent of the population was partially or completely illiterate. He complained that Castilian Spanish “has been in the process of disap- pearing and continues to do so in the Marianas.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, petroleum was replacing whale oil for fuel. Only a few whalers a year stopped at Guam by the 1880s, and there was practically no com- merce with the island. Traditional trade between the Carolines and Guam had ceased. All adult local males, except the principales, still had to perform polo communal labor for forty days a year or pay for exemption. Land tenure on Guam had evolved whereby the manak‘kilo families and the church had acquired large estates, the haciendas. A differ- ence in the hacienda system on Guam from other Spanish colonies was that on Guam the major land- owners resided mostly in Agana (the manggi Hagat- na in Chamorro) instead of on country haciendas as elsewhere in Spain’s empire.</p>
                <p>In addition to the polo obligation, many ordinary Chamorros also fell into deep debts to the govern- ment store, to the church, and to manak‘kilo fami- lies as a result of loans, leases of lanchos, and so forth. Debts were normally paid off by labor, re- sulting in peonage for many of the poorest people from one generation to the next, both for polo and on private haciendas. Peonage in turn increased Chamorro aversion to manual labor because such work benefited only the Spaniards and principalia families.</p>
                <p>Consequently, many Chamorro men left the is- lands to work at jobs abroad, with nearly 800 Cha- morros working in Honolulu in the 1880s. Olive wrote in puzzlement that on Guam Chamorros “are lazy, indolent, ignorant,” but once abroad they be- came “good workers.... There is a common saying that the Chamorro away from his island is a lamp brightening a stranger’s door.”</p>
                <p>One positive note on Guam in the last years of the nineteenth century was the emergence of limited democracy at the village level and free use of crown</p>
                <p>100</p>
                <p>lands by Chamorros. By a royal order in May 1885, gobernadorcillos and other local officials were elect- ed for two-years from among the principalia class in the villages in place of appointed Spanish alcaldes. The gobernadorcillos and other officials received small salaries and formed the patroénes, or bosses, of the villages and barrios, dispensing patronage among their families and friends. Further democra- tization at the local level in the Philippine provinces was ordered by a royal decree in May 1893, called the “Maura Law,” but by then dissatisfaction with Spanish rule was too widespread to be stopped.</p>
                <p>Religion, not political reform, was the refuge of the poor on the island, and all Chamorros remained devout. In October 1894, the Cavite ship brought back to Guam the statue of Our Lady of Camarin (originally brought to Guam by Spanish soldiers two centuries earlier) from Manila, where it had been sent to be restored. The procession from An- igua to the Agafia cathedral behind the small, elabo- rately robed statue numbered some 7,000 people. Like similar statues in the Philippines, it was an ob- ject of deep veneration and remains the patron saint of the island in its place of honor above the altar of the Hagatia Cathedral-Basilica. The statue is still honored at the Feast of the Immaculate Conception each December 8 with a special Mass at the cathe- dral and a large procession.</p>
                <p>In August 1896, insurrection against the Span- iards erupted into bloody warfare in the Philippines. Spanish reaction was ruthless, and large numbers of Filipino rebels were rounded up and once more ban- ished as deportados to the Marianas and the Caro- lines. No one on Guam was prepared for the influx of prisoners, so the governor, Lieutenant Colonel Jacobo Marina, crammed many of them, men and women, into the dilapidated old presidio barracks in Agana.</p>
                <p>Among the deportados were many who had pre- viously been exiled to Guam and knew the weak- nesses of the old presidio barracks. On the night of December 19 they attempted to escape through the thatched roof but were captured, with one killed and five wounded. The next night, the prisoners made another attempt, this time en masse through the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 6</p>
                <p>roof and by battering on the doors. The guards— Chamorros from the artillery company—panicked. They blasted volley after volley of rifle fire into the deportados. Father Francisco Resano described the scene the next morning: “The cuartel-prision doors were opened, and there before our eyes was a horrible sight: sprawled on the floor and bathed in their own blood were eighty dead and forty-five wounded.”</p>
                <p>The massacre of Filipino deportados at Agafia in 1896 brought to the surface the main themes un- der the long, fallible rule of Spain in the Mariana Islands, themes that endured like tough threads in a well-worn coat about to be donned by a new owner. The first theme was the close ties between Guam and the Philippines. From the first day of San Vitores’ mission, Filipinos played major roles on Guam under the Spaniards. Pampangos, Ta- galogs, Ilocanos, Visayans, and others infused new customs, commerce, and vitality into the Mariana Islands, sometimes as enemies, sometimes as allies, and sometimes as victims of the Chamorros. Despite Filipino influence, however, there remained in 1898, and there remains today, a distinction between the two ethnicities, with Chamorros and many Filipinos careful to maintain that distinction. Furthermore, the Filipino presence on Guam was not a single enti- ty, but a complex social dynamic in which different peoples from the Philippines each formed associa- tions in which they maintained their own distinc- tive languages and customs until intermarriages ab- sorbed them into the neo-Chamorro society.</p>
                <p>A second underlying theme in Guam’s history un- der Spain was the geopolitical role of the island in support of imperial interests in the western Pacific. Guam both linked the Philippines with and shielded them from the eastern Pacific and was the anchor of Spain’s claims in Micronesia. By the 1890s, not only was Guam a small central coaling station for trade in the region, but it was increasingly important as a naval crossroads. Nevertheless, by then the whole region was openly or latently hostile to Spain owing to inept Spanish policies, and it needed only a shove to break away from Madrid’s tired arms.</p>
                <p>TWILIGHT OF PAX HISPANICA 1800-1898</p>
                <p>Even geopolitics, however, was not as promi- nent a factor in Guam’s postcontact history as was Christianity. At first a scourge, then a refuge against natural calamities and the follies of alien humans, the fierce embrace of suffering and fate that is Ro- man Catholicism became an abiding spiritual heri- tage of the people of the Marianas. Of all the lega- cies of Spain—which included the patron system with its privileges and elitism, the pare system with its reliance on family ties, and male enthusiasm for military service—the Christian religion would be the most enduring for the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>A fourth historical theme in the Mariana Islands almost as durable as Catholicism was the inadequa- cy—at times sheer incompetence—of government. Colonial military government almost destroyed the indigenous people and was inadequate in providing for the needs of the local society, as it was in the Philippines. The government in Agafia—top-heavy and underfinanced—failed to protect the interests of Spain itself despite the efforts of good governors such as Tobias, Villalobos, and de la Corte.</p>
                <p>Colonial military government shaped a fifth theme in Guam’s history under Spain: the Chamor- ros became peripheral to the political and economic development of their island. Nearly all efforts for improvement or reform were aimed at satisfying the interests of the colonial power, not at improv- ing the conditions of the indigenous people. In or- der for any government to be successful, its subjects must accept the legitimacy of the officials who wield power. The Spaniards were able to establish legiti- macy in the Marianas with respect to religion but failed to do so with respect to political authority. Spanish government remained largely authoritarian and alien to the Chamorros throughout Spain’s rule over them.</p>
                <p>Finally, the most hidden historical thread of all</p>
                <p>101</p>
                <p>was the remarkable resiliency of the Chamorro identity beneath the seemingly heavy veneer of for- eign acculturation. This identity was maintained through language and family ties that managed to adapt to conditions imposed by overwhelming alien forces. The neo-Chamorro culture of 1898 was a synthesis, what anthropologist Alexander Spoehr later called “a Hispanicized Oceanic Hybrid,” of foreign and local customs. The Chamorros were considerably changed from their precontact culture, but the Chamorro core identity persevered, at least in the perceptions of the local people themselves.</p>
                <p>None of these themes would end with the coming of the North Americans; all continued in some form after 1898. Moreover, none of these themes applied to other islands in Micronesia to the degree they did in the Philippines and on Guam. The Chamorros had been set apart from their island neighbors by outsiders and by themselves as the most Western- ized and least traditional of all Pacific islanders by 1898.</p>
                <p>That year on the morning of June 20, Governor Juan Marina (who had replaced his brother Jacobo in 1897) was brought information that four uniden- tified foreign vessels, one of them a warship, were steaming past Agafia toward Apra Harbor. No news had reached Guam from the outside since April 9, when the last mail boat from Manila arrived. The governor issued instructions for the strange ships to be received as customary for friendly visitors. He would soon learn to his astonishment that they were hostile American vessels and that Spain had been at war with the United States since April 25. After two centuries of domination by the island’s first alien in- truders, the people of Guam were about to experi- ence the second major invasion in their history, and this time the Spaniards would be the victims.</p>

                <p>The New Imperialists</p>
                <p>Guam had nothing to do with the causes and little to do with the conduct of the Spanish-American War. Nonetheless, the war was an epochal turning point in the history of the Mariana Islands. The Ameri- can clash with Spain grew largely out of the expan- sionist ambitions of highly aggressive and mostly Republican party leaders in the United States. Men such as Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and the influential naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan wanted to make the United States a world naval power.</p>
                <p>Mahan, a rare example of a precise military mind with intellectual vision, preached the gospel of geo- politics and nationalism, that to become a great nation the United States must extend its sea power beyond the North American continent to strategic locations in the Pacific and in the Caribbean. For Mahan, maritime geography was the bones of strat- egy, and trade followed the flag.</p>
                <p>By 1898, the United States had already tiptoed into Oceania as a hesitant colonial power with claims of sovereignty over several tiny unclaimed islands: Jarvis, Baker, and Howland in 1856 and Midway in 1867. Mining of fertilizer (guano) from bird droppings was the main reason for acquisition. The Americans then took a giant imperial step with the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. Next, the United States, along with Germany and Great</p>
                <p>To02</p>
                <p>Britain, became a member of a protectorate over Samoa. This awkward but rewarding colonial ini- tiative led in 1899 to U.S. acquisition of American Samoa.</p>
                <p>These steps paralleled American involvement in Hawai‘i, where in 1887 the United States obtained exclusive use of Pearl Harbor for a naval station in return for which the Kingdom of Hawai‘i could ex- port sugar duty free to the United States. In 1893, American businessmen in Honolulu, eager to have Hawai‘i a part of the United States, overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy, and in July 1898 President William McKinley annexed the islands. With dubi- ous logic, McKinley remarked, “We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did Cal- ifornia. It is manifest destiny.”</p>
                <p>Cuba, however, not the Pacific, was the focus of American colonialism in the late 1890s. American disapproval of the autocratic military rule of Spain in Cuba was fanned by the jingoistic U.S. “yellow press,” such as William Randolph Hearst’s news- paper, the New York Journal. Cuban rebels received U.S. support, and when the American battleship Maine mysteriously blew up on a visit to Havana in February 1898, Hearst’s headlines blared, “THE WHOLE COUNTRY THRILLS WITH WAR FE- VER.” Teddy Roosevelt, by then assistant secretary of the navy, wrote, “The Maine was sunk by an act</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>of dirty treachery on the part of the Spaniards.” In reality, no one yet knows who blew up the Maine.</p>
                <p>Roosevelt had already dispatched the U.S. Asi- atic Squadron of five new steam-powered cruisers and several gunboats under the command of Com- modore George Dewey to Hong Kong in order to blockade Spanish Manila should war break out. On April 25, 1898, the U.S. Congress declared war on Spain. Dewey immediately steamed for Manila, but he did not just blockade the bay. In seven hours of fighting, his squadron blew out of the water a col- lection of antique Spanish warships in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. Dewey became an instant hero and was promoted to rear admiral.</p>
                <p>The new rear admiral, however, faced an unan- ticipated problem: he could not capture Manila from the Spanish army because he was short of ground troops. Instead of American soldiers, Fili- pino rebels under Emilio Aguinaldo proceeded to lay siege to the city. Dewey feared the Spanish home fleet and sizable German and Japanese fleets in the area might attempt to relieve Manila. He cabled the Navy Department to send American ground troops and naval reinforcements urgently so that he could take Manila and Luzon.</p>
                <p>It took three weeks before the first reinforcements in the form of the cruiser USS Charleston with a contingent of U.S. Marines left San Francisco under the command of Captain Henry Glass bound for Manila via Honolulu. The Charleston was the first U.S. Navy steam-powered warship to abandon all- sail rigging. Glass waited in Hawai‘i until joined by the troop transports City of Pekin, City of Sydney, and Australia, all fully loaded with U.S. Army units hastily mobilized on the U.S. West Coast.</p>
                <p>On June 4 the convoy of four ships under Glass put to sea from Honolulu. Anxious to join the fight- ing in the Philippines, Glass opened his sealed or- ders from Secretary of the Navy John D. Long as soon as he was clear of land. Instead of going direct- ly to Manila, he was ordered “to capture the port of Guam, and to make prisoners of the governor and other officials and any armed forces that may be there.” He was to take no more than “one or two days” to accomplish this chore, and only then was</p>
                <p>103</p>
                <p>he to proceed to the Philippines. Glass set course for the Marianas.</p>
                <p>Early on the morning of June 20, the ships en- tered the channel between Rota and Guam, and turned southwest on the same track Magellan had followed nearly four centuries earlier. Sailing past Ritidian Point and then by Tumon Bay, the Charles- ton swung close to shore off Agafia in an unsuccess- ful hunt for Spanish ships. Glass mistakenly thought Agafia was a port. The Americans had little infor- mation about Guam, and most of what they knew came from Thomas A. Hallet, a third officer on the Australia, who had years earlier visited Guam as a whaler captain and who now acted as pilot for the convoy.</p>
                <p>Leaving the transports outside Apra, the Charles- ton entered the harbor through thick tropical rain squalls that made it difficult for Hallet to navigate the entrance. “With all hands at general quarters and guns loaded we steamed in under Point Orote,” according to Robert E. Coontz, a lieutenant aboard who would return to Guam fourteen years later as governor.</p>
                <p>Little Fort Santiago on the top of Orote Peninsula remained silent as the cruiser passed by it to with- in range of old Fort Santa Cruz. Only a Japanese brigantine was anchored in the harbor. Glass fired his three-inch guns at Fort Santa Cruz to draw fire, but no shots were returned. The only reaction was by a couple of startled fishermen at the fort. They paddled away frantically in dugout canoes. The Americans did not know that both of Apra’s forts had been abandoned as fortifications years before. Disappointed at the lack of action, Glass had the Charleston anchor and prepared to land an armed force.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, a group of Spanish officials and civilians had gathered leisurely at the Piti landing on the opposite side of the harbor to conduct cus- toms and health inspections of the foreign ships in the usual manner. They assumed that the shelling was a Salute and sent for two of the six little antique brass cannons in Agafia to be brought to the port to return the courtesy. Among the Spaniards was an American citizen, Francisco (Frank) Portusach.</p>

                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>USS Charleston, 1898. This was a state-of-the-art steam-powered cruiser, the first American armored warship not to use sails, when it served as the flagship of Captain Henry Glass and his naval squadron, which captured Guam for</p>
                <p>the United States on June 21, 1898. After accepting the surrender of Guam’s last Spanish governor, Lt. Colonel Juan Marina, Glass sailed on to take part in the American occupation of the Philippines that ended the Spanish empire in the Pacific. The Charleston subsequently sank in the Philippines after it struck a reef. (From the collection of the Microne- sian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>A Chamorro mestizo who spoke English, Portusach had once worked for the San Francisco Chronicle as an elevator operator. Naturalized in Chicago in 1888, he married an American woman, and they returned to Guam, where the family owned a store and some boats to service ships in Apra Harbor. The Spaniards and Frank Portusach sailed out to the American cruiser in separate boats. There, to their surprise, they learned from Glass of the state of war between the United States and Spain and that the Spanish military officers were all now prison- ers of war. Captain Glass then dispatched two of</p>
                <p>the Spaniards ashore on parole with a letter to Gov- ernor Juan Marina in which Glass demanded that the governor report immediately to the Charleston for the “surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam.”</p>
                <p>While the two Spanish officers went off to Agafia to deliver the American ultimatum to Marina (and halt the salute cannons, which they met en route), Frank Portusach offered his boats to Glass to lighter coal from the transports to the cruiser and to provide supplies to the American ships. There was no coal on Guam at the time, so Glass accepted Portusach’s</p>

                <p>~</p>
                <p>offer. One of the U.S. soldiers later wrote that Por- tusach’s boatmen sold fresh fruit at astoundingly low prices. For one penny they could purchase three bananas, or two mangos, or one pineapple, but a “live monkey” cost two American dollars.</p>
                <p>When Governor Marina in Agafia got over his shock at receiving the ultimatum to surrender, he replied by letter that he could not board a hostile foreign warship. He agreed, however, to meet Glass on shore at Piti. Early the next day, Glass sent two naval officers, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther and Ensign Waldo Evans, ashore to Piti in a whale- boat with a small party of sailors under a white flag of truce. A backup force of infantry, along with marines from the Charleston, followed in boats, but they remained offshore in view of the landing site. After a delay for the sake of Spanish pride, the</p>

                <p>Captain Henry Glass, USN. In command of the cruiser USS Charleston and a naval squadron, he captured Guam for the United States on June 21, 1898. By rigidly following his orders only “to capture the port of Guam,” he missed the oppor- tunity to take possession of all the Marianas or of Micronesia. As a result, the Germans and later the Japanese occupied all of Micronesia other than Guam, and the Marianas remain incongru- ously divided into two political entities today. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>governor wrote out and gave to Braunersreuther a letter in Spanish for Glass in which Marina stated, “T am under the sad necessity of being unable to re- sist such superior forces and I respectfully accede to your demands.”</p>
                <p>Following arguments over procedure when Braun- ersreuther opened and read the letter on the spot, all the Spanish military officers were taken as prisoners to the City of Sydney. With no need to land, the U.S. backup force returned to the ships. One Spanish of- ficial, José Sixto Rodriguez, was not made prisoner, apparently because he was a civilian. He returned to Agafia. Failure to arrest Sixto, who was the ad- ministrator of the treasury, would prove to be a mistake by the Americans. Glass then inspected Fort Santa Cruz with a party that included three war cor- respondents. There the American flag was raised at</p>
                <p>106</p>
                <p>2:45 p.m. on June 21, 1898, over Guam as a twenty- one-gun salute boomed out from the Charleston and the “Star Spangled Banner” was played by bands on the troop ships. The flag was lowered that afternoon and taken back to the Charleston since Glass did not know whether the United States intended to retain Guam permanently or not.</p>
                <p>Later in the day, all the Spanish troops on Guam assembled at Piti to surrender to the busy Lieuten- ant Braunersreuther. Fifty-four regular Spanish ma- rine infantry and two officers were disarmed. Fifty- two Chamorro militiamen and one officer of the local artillery company were released after turning over their weapons.</p>
                <p>The Spanish troops and officers and their small arms, along with four Spanish flags, were taken aboard the City of Sydney, but Glass did not bother with the arms, supplies, and munitions stored in Agafia. An American correspondent reported the “native soldiers joyfully relinquished their arms to the Americans.” In contrast, Spanish priests on Guam reported that the “population became alarmed....Entire families, overwhelmed by fear and anguish, left their homes and fled into the bush.”</p>
                <p>According to Frank Portusach, whose boats were loading coal onto the Charleston, Glass asked Por- tusach to “take care of the island until some other officers or man-of-war might reach Guam.” This casual request was not put in writing, if it was ac- tually made; the U.S. Navy never confirmed it. Ac- cording to Portusach, he accepted the offer and said that there would be no need for “aid, meaning sol- diers for the island.”</p>
                <p>With the bloodless, almost comical seizure of “the port of Guam” completed, the convoy departed the next morning without American troops ever having entered Agafia. Glass, impatient to get to Manila, left no U.S. officers or enlisted men on Guam to oversee America’s newest possession. Spanish au- thority, however, remained present in the person of José Sixto, who was not a man to submit meekly to American rule.</p>
                <p>The departure of Juan Marina left Guam with- out a colonial chief executive for the first time since</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>1668. This inadvertent interregnum, a period of confusion for everyone on Guam, would last nearly fourteen months until the arrival of the first U.S na- val governor in August 1899.</p>
                <p>A Colonial Interregnum</p>
                <p>Elsewhere on June 22, 1898, the day the Ameri- can convoy departed Guam, an American army of 17,000 ill-trained but enthusiastic soldiers was in- vading Cuba. By August 12, the fighting in Cuba and Puerto Rico ceased under an armistice, as it did the next day in the Philippines following the “Battle of Manila,” in which the Spanish forces surren- dered after a mock show of resistance. It was indeed a splendid little war from Teddy Roosevelt’s view- point. In the terms of peace, Spain agreed to relin- quish Cuba, to cede Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States, and to permit the United States to oc- cupy “the city, bay, and harbor at Manila,” pending a peace treaty to “determine the control, disposition and government of the Philippines.”</p>
                <p>While the victorious Americans organized a com- mission to negotiate a peace treaty in Paris with the Spaniards, Germany and Japan moved into the western Pacific as Spain withdrew. The Germans wanted to divide up the Philippines and Micro- nesia with the Americans but were rebuffed. Ger- many then negotiated secretly with Spain, and, in September 1898, the two countries concluded a se- cret agreement whereby Germany would purchase the Marshalls and Carolines, including Palau, and all the Marianas except Guam. The two countries agreed that the islands would remain under Span- ish control until the Spanish treaty with the United States was concluded. The Japanese were left out of the agreement, a mistake, as it would later turn out.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, in late August 1898 the U.S. Na- val War Board recommended that the United States obtain a Philippine base as the ultimate position in a chain of military stations across the Pacific to sup- port American commercial and missionary interests in China in accord with Alfred Thayer Mahan’s doc- trine of maritime geopolitics. Owing to the distanc- es involved—San Francisco is about 7,000 sailing</p>

                <p>miles from Manila—coaling stations were needed en route. Otherwise, steamships had to be accompa- nied by special coal-carrying ships called colliers to be recoaled within 2,000 to 4,000 miles. The Naval War Board suggested three stations west of Hawai'i: a transit station in the Marianas at Guam; a base at Cavite in Manila Bay; and a station at Pago Pago, Samoa, which was between the potential Panama Canal and Australia-New Zealand.</p>
                <p>In September 1898, the Literary Digest confirmed public support of American expansionism in a poll (a new technique at the time) of 192 newspaper edi- tors. The majority of editors favored annexation of the conquered Spanish areas for U.S. naval bases. By October, President McKinley was in a quanda- ry over the pros and cons of annexing the Philip- pines. A religious man, he later wrote, “The truth is I didn’t want the Philippines and when they came to us as a gift from the gods, I did not know what to do about them....I thought at first we would take only Manila; then Luzon; then other islands, perhaps, also. And then I went to bed, and went to sleep and slept soundly.”</p>
                <p>When the U.S. peace commissioners in Paris cabled for instructions, McKinley replied that the United States was to offer $20 million to Spain for all the Philippines, including Guam. Spain reluc- tantly accepted what amounted to an American ultimatum. Guam’s destiny under the Americans, just as under the Spaniards, was initially tied to the Philippines.</p>
                <p>In the treaty negotiations, the United States still had the opportunity to acquire the Carolines, or at least all the Marianas. In an article in October 1898, a perceptive American commentator, Edward Van Dyke Robinson, not knowing of the German efforts, pointed out the strategic value of the Micro- nesian islands that surround Guam, and he noted the possibility of their falling into hands stronger than those of the Spaniards and thereby posing a threat to Guam. He wrote, “Guam is either too much or too little.” Some American naval officers also favored U.S. control of the Carolines. One wrote, “In the hands of an enemy they would offer a serious menace to the line of communication be-</p>
                <p>107</p>
                <p>tween the Pacific Coast and the Philippines.” None- theless, officials in Washington, D.C., let the oppor- tunity pass, and Guam would soon be surrounded by German islands.</p>
                <p>The Treaty of Paris between Her Majesty Maria Cristina, the queen regent of Spain, and the United States was signed on December 12, 1898, ratified in early 1899 by both governments, and proclaimed as law on April 11, 1899. This treaty would be accept- ed by the international community, including the League of Nations after World War I and the United Nations after World War II, as establishing U.S. sov- ereignty over Guam under international law.</p>
                <p>The debate over the treaty was historic in that it made the United States a colonial nation and a ma- jor Pacific power. After initially opposing the treaty, Democratic senators finally supported it under the erroneous assumption that the Philippines would be granted independence. Contrary to that expecta- tion, the United States ended up fighting the Filipino independence movement in a bitter guerrilla war that did not end until 1902. With respect to Guam, the Treaty of Paris stated:</p>
                <p>Article II. Spain cedes to the United States the is- land of Porto Rico [sic] and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and the is- land of Guam in the Marianas or Ladrones.</p>
                <p>Article V....Spain will...proceed to evacuate the Philippines, as well as the island of Guam....Stands of colors, uncaptured war vessels, small arms, guns of all calibres, with their carriages and accessories, powder, live ammunition, live stock, and materials and supplies of all kinds, belonging to the land and naval forces of Spain in the Philippines and Guam, remain the property of Spain.</p>
                <p>Article VIII....Spain...cedes...in the island of Guam...all the buildings, wharves, barracks, forts, structures, public highways and other immovable property which, in conformity with law, belong to the public domain, and as such belong to the Crown of Spain.</p>
                <p>Article IX. The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ced-</p>
                <p>108</p>
                <p>ed to the United States shall be determined by the Congress.</p>
                <p>At no time in the transfer of sovereignty did American or Spanish officials consult with the in- habitants of Guam. The treaty acknowledges the existence of the “native inhabitants” but did not ex- plicitly obligate the United States to bring the peo- ple of Guam to self-government or to improve their political, social, or economic well-being. There is no stipulation in the treaty that residual sovereignty re- mained in the hands of the indigenous people, and there is no acknowledgment of indigenous rights in the treaty other than what the U.S. Congress decides them to be. The treaty was a clear expression of the colonialist values accepted by the Americans and Europeans as normal at the time, no matter how re- pugnant they later became.</p>
                <p>With the conclusion of the Paris treaty, Germany signed its own treaty with Spain to take possession of the Marshall and Caroline Islands, including Pa- lau, and all the Marianas other than Guam. The price for the islands was 18 million German marks (4.2 million American dollars at the time), a bargain for Germany.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy was preparing to oc- cupy Guam even before the Paris peace treaty was signed. In December the USS Bennington visited Guam and conducted a hydrographic survey of Apra Harbor for the purpose of establishing a na- val coaling and watering station. A naval collier, the Brutus, was also ordered to Guam to recoal the Bennington. The navy recommended to President McKinley that Guam be placed under naval admin- istration. McKinley obligingly issued Executive Or- der 108-A on December 23, 1898: “The Island of Guam in the Ladrones is hereby placed under the control of the Department of Navy. The Secretary of the Navy will take such steps as may be necessary to establish the authority of the United States and to give it the necessary protection and government.”</p>
                <p>In January 1899, Navy Secretary Long selected Captain Richard Phillips Leary to be the first U.S. naval governor of Guam. Leary’s instructions stated sternly:</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>Within the absolute domain of naval authority, which necessarily is and must remain supreme in the ceded territory until the legislation of the U.S. shall otherwise provide, the municipal [i.e., Spanish] laws of the territory...are to be considered as continuing in force...the mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule. In fulfillment of this high mission...there must be sedulously maintained the strong arm of authority, to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles to the be- stowal of the blessings of good government upon the people of the Island of Guam under the green flag of the United States.</p>
                <p>The instructions were clear on one point: the needs of the military on Guam took precedence over all other matters in the administration of the island. The island government was designated as the “na- val government of Guam.” The chief executive was given two hats: one strictly military hat by appoint- ment from the secretary of the navy as “Comman- dant, United States Naval Station, Guam,” and a second hat by presidential commission as “Gover- nor of Guam” with jurisdiction over all nonmilitary matters. Thus, despite the rhetoric about “the mild sway of justice and right,” the American naval gov- ernor was given the same supreme politico-military powers over the people and the Island of Guam as the “arbitrary rule” of the Spanish governors.</p>
                <p>While decisions were being taken in Europe and Washington, events back on Guam had taken bi- zarre turns in the absence of American officials. After the departure of Glass, José Sixto assumed charge of the government of the Marianas, includ- ing the treasury, which still contained cash, mostly Mexican silver dollars. Sixto was the only man with a key to the treasury safe with the cash.</p>
                <p>In the absence of American military author- ity, Sixto proceeded to pay himself a salary as act- ing governor from the cash on hand and to gather about him a pro-Spanish group, which included all the priests except Father Palomo. Sixto also paid the Chamorro militiamen salaries from the same cash in order to assure their loyalty to him and to Spain.</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Frank Portusach, Father Palomo, and several other prominent Chamorros formed a pro- American group but did not at first attempt to take control away from Sixto.</p>
                <p>By Christmas 1898, Sixto had nearly emptied the Agafia treasury, mostly into his own pockets. Law and order were breaking down. A small riot between Filipinos and Chamorros erupted at cockfights in December at Sumay. Filipinos on Guam who were former convicts were disliked by Chamorros, and the antipathy was mutual. Portusach, wielding a pistol, broke up the fighting at Sumay and arrest- ed about twenty Filipinos, whom he packed off to jail in Agafia. The public disorder and the news of the American victory in Manila convinced the pro- American group that it was time to depose Sixto.</p>
                <p>On New Year’s Day 1899, Frank Portusach, Fa- ther Palomo, and several other pro-American lead- ers gathered in Agana and signed a document to dismiss Sixto and appoint Venancio Roberto in his place as acting governor. They then started across the plaza toward the governor’s palacio to confront Sixto but halted at the sudden tolling of the signal bells of the old ammunition magazine on the hill be- hind Agana. An American naval vessel was arriving. Everyone immediately postponed all action until the next day to present their cases to the American cap- tain of the ship.</p>
                <p>The ship was the collier Brutus, sent to recoal the Bennington, which was scheduled to arrive later in the month to survey Apra Harbor for a coaling and water station. The captain of the Brutus, Lieutenant Vincendon L. Cottman, was surprised the next day when the two local factions came aboard his ship at Apra Harbor. Cottman at the time had no informa- tion on the outcome of the Paris peace talks, so he let Sixto continue as acting governor.</p>
                <p>Cottman and his officers then undertook recon- naissances of Agana and Apra Harbor to locate a coaling site. The twenty-eight-page handwritten re- port that Cottman prepared in February 1899 for the secretary of the navy was the first detailed and current information about Guam that Washington had received until then. Like many Spanish officers before him, Cottman made a number of recom-</p>
                <p>109</p>
                <p>mendations to his superiors to improve conditions on Guam with respect to land matters, taxes, Apra Harbor, and so forth. The Department of the Navy gave Cottman’s report to Captain Leary, who was then preparing to depart the U.S. East Coast for Guam. Leary later implemented a number of Cott- man’s recommendations.</p>
                <p>On January 23, 1899, the Brutus was joined on Guam by the Bennington under the command of Captain Edward D. Taussig, who brought news that the Paris treaty had been signed and that Guam was now a U.S. territory. After being briefed by Cottman on the local situation, Taussig issued the first two general orders by an American official on Guam. The first order, proclaimed on January 28, contin- ued Spanish laws in force and ordered an audit of the treasury books. The second order on January 30 took possession of “all public lands, recently the property of the Spanish Government, bordering on the port of San Luis d’Apra.” The land was need- ed as a coaling site and navy yard, and its seizure was the first of a long series of controversial steps whereby United States governmental agencies ac- quired large portions of land on Guam.</p>
                <p>The audit of the Spanish treasury records revealed that Sixto had paid himself and other employees eighteen months’ advance pay, leaving the treasury nearly empty for local governmental needs. Taussig stripped Sixto of his position and appointed Joaquin Pérez y Cruz as acting governor, Vicente Pérez as secretary, and Vicente Herrero in charge of financ- es. Taussig also approved of an advisory council, or junta, of six prominent Chamorros, including Pérez as chair. Pérez, from a manak‘kilo family, was the gobernadorcillo of Agafia and thus respected locally.</p>
                <p>On February 1, 1899, the Americans once more raised the U.S. flag over Fort Santa Cruz, but this time they simultaneously raised a flag over the gov- ernor’s residence in Agafia before a detachment of U.S. Marines and the Bennington band. The Brutus departed later the same day for San Francisco, where Cottman sent his report plus reports by Taussig to Washington. Back on Guam, the Yorktown arrived with mail and orders for the Bennington to report to Manila. The two ships sailed away on February</p>
                <p>110</p>
                <p>15. Taussig, like Glass, felt no need to leave troops on Guam.</p>
                <p>With a new government but still no American offi- cials, the Chamorros settled down uneasily to await the next appearance of their casual new masters. While waiting, Joaquin Pérez arrested José Sixto for misappropriation of funds, which Sixto was or- dered to repay. The Spaniard was allowed freedom as long as he did not leave the island.</p>
                <p>Not until after March, when the American-char- tered collier Nanshan arrived, did another U.S. offi- cial spend time ashore. He was Lieutenant Louis A. Kaiser, the only naval officer aboard the Nanshan. The collier’s mission was to recoal U.S. warships. Kaiser had few duties on the anchored Nanshan, so he rented a house in Agafia and spent much of his time hunting with the pro-American group. Soon he was entangled in local politics even though he spoke no Spanish or Chamorro.</p>
                <p>In May, the old Spanish steamer Elcano arrived at Apra en route to Saipan with Colonel Eugenio Blanco, the new temporary Spanish governor of the northern Marianas. The Elcano was “fright- fully overcrowded” with about 700 refugees from the Philippines, according to Kaiser. The passengers included nearly 300 “Macabebes,” Pampango sol- diers still loyal to Spain. Blanco requested that all Spanish arms, munitions, and medical supplies still on Guam be handed over to him in accord with Ar- ticle V of the Paris treaty.</p>
                <p>Kaiser refused Blanco’s request on the grounds that he did not have a copy of the Paris treaty to confirm that provision. The Elcano departed with- out the arms and supplies but with a number of Fili- pino malcontents, to the relief of the Chamorros on Guam. Later in May, the Elcano returned to Guam from Saipan on the way to Spain and this time took away the troublesome José Sixto. He had repaid his debt to the Guam treasury with money borrowed in part from Father Palomo.</p>
                <p>In June, the Spanish schooner Esmeralda, which had carried supplies to the Micronesian islands since 1888, arrived with a Spanish officer from Manila with another request for the Spanish arms</p>

                <p>and supplies on Guam. He had a letter from Gen- eral Elwell S. Otis, the U.S. commander of all the Philippines, authorizing the turnover. Again Kaiser refused, stating that the army general had no au- thority on Guam. The Esmeralda sailed away emp- ty-handed to Yap to retrieve Spaniards. By this time, Joaquin Pérez and the Chamorro junta were fed up with Kaiser. He had become a sort of Lord Jim, as in Joseph Conrad’s novel, assuming authority in his little tropical kingdom when it suited him but with- out taking responsibility for the consequences.</p>
                <p>In July, the Esmeralda returned to Guam, and this time Pérez allowed the Spaniards to take their arms and supplies. Kaiser—angry and insisting that he was the “senior officer” in charge on Guam—tre- moved Pérez as acting governor the next day and appointed William (Willie) Pritchard Coe to the po- sition. This was the first of innumerable later con- frontations between island officials, who acted on the knowledge of complex, sometimes hidden local histories, and American officials, who demanded immediate solutions to problems on the basis of su- perficial information.</p>
                <p>Coe, a friend of Kaiser’s, was a personable Samo- an-American who had been on Guam only a short while. To get around Kaiser and Coe, the Chamor- ros created a bicameral legislature on July 23. Three men, including Father Palomo, were elected to the upper house, and six were chosen for the lower house. Kaiser immediately disbanded what would have been the first legislature in Guam’s history.</p>
                <p>Willie Coe’s two-week tenure as unofficial acting governor and Kaiser’s role as U.S. proconsul ended on the morning of August 7, 1899. On that date, the USS Yosemite steamed into Apra Harbor with the stern Captain Richard Phillips Leary aboard, and Guam officially became a “U.S. Naval Station.” From then on, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind who was the real governor of Guam.</p>
                <p>The First U.S. Naval Administration</p>
                <p>Richard Leary was of the same conservative military mold as Henry Glass: an Annapolis graduate and a Protestant with long service as a line officer. Single,</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>he spoke no Spanish and had little experience in civ- il governmental affairs. After he received his com- mission as the governor of Guam from McKinley, Leary spent four months elaborately outfitting the Yosemite, an auxiliary cruiser of about 6,000 tons, as station ship for Guam. He also purchased consid- erable supplies and equipment to set up the gover- nor’s residence and offices out of an ample budget.</p>
                <p>In May 1899, the Yosemite, with a bright coat of white paint and after a visit by President McKin- ley himself, departed New York with a complement of about eighty sailors and a 120-man U.S. Marine battalion of two companies. The Yosemite sailed lei- surely across the Atlantic, through the Suez Canal, and stopped at Singapore (where Leary purchased new technology called a “telephone system”), which was a normal route in those days before the Panama Canal was constructed. Just three days after his ar- rival on Guam in August, the new governor issued his first proclamation to the people of Guam. In it he stressed separation of church and state and sub- mission to American authority: “All political rights heretofore exercized by the Clergy in dominating the people of the Island, are hereby abolished, and everyone is guaranteed absolute freedom of worship and full protection in the lawful pursuits of life, as long as that protection is deserved by actual submis- sion to and compliance with the requirements of the Government of the United States.”</p>
                <p>Leary lived on the anchored Yosemite for the next three months during the renovation of the ten-year- old governor’s residence in Agana (the Americans in this period dropped the diacritic over the writ- ten letter 7 but continued to pronounce the word as Agafia, as in Spanish). He was joined by his aide, Lieutenant William Edwin Safford, a thirty-nine- year-old bachelor who arrived on the Brutus along with his Japanese manservant, Miyamoto, and three Jersey cows and one bull. The Brutus, with Lieutenant Cottman still captain, had to relieve the Nanshan of its collier duties. The Nanshan would depart three weeks later for Manila with the med- dlesome Lieutenant Kaiser aboard as well as fifteen Filipino former convicts, two Spanish priests, and several Spanish citizens.</p>
                <p>111</p>
                <p>Safford relieved Willie Coe and assumed duties as the trial judge for local cases, recorder of deeds and titles, and auditor of the treasury. These duties in effect, but not in formal title, made him the first lieutenant governor of Guam under the Americans. Although an Annapolis graduate, Safford was not a line officer like Leary or Glass. He had served in Latin America and was fluent in German and Span- ish. This unassuming, intelligent man studied Cha- morro, built a plant nursery, began a catalog of local plants, acquired a house and two lanchos to raise his own food, and in his spare time taught classes in English at night to Chamorros.</p>
                <p>He discovered the Spanish archives in Agana “eat- en in places by termites, and edges mildewed...the writing for the most part beautiful.” He sent all the Spanish documents except for land records back to the Library of Congress. For advice on local cus- toms, he relied on Father Palomo, and the two men became close friends. Palomo brought Safford into contact with the manak‘kilo upper-class mestizos of Agana, among whom he soon became liked and re- spected. He found the local elite well educated, His- panicized, and rather disdainful of the Americans as less sophisticated than the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>The first formal request of the Chamorros to Saf- ford was a petition to have Filipino former convicts remaining on Guam deported because they were a “menace to peace.” Leary concurred, but Safford excused two men because their Chamorro wives and children would be left destitute without hus- bands (families were not deported). The deportees were the fifteen former convicts that departed on the Nanshan with Lieutenant Kaiser.</p>
                <p>While Safford was reorganizing civil authority in Agana, Leary was busy setting up a permanent American military presence on the island. He hired Chamorros as workers at twenty-four cents per day, but they turned out to be unwilling to do manual labor, so Leary put marines to work on civil projects as well as military construction. In the meantime, more U.S. naval vessels were stopping at Apra Har- bor, where a navy yard was created on the former Spanish crown property at Piti.</p>
                <p>One vessel was the USS Nero. Its mission was to</p>
                <p>112</p>
                <p>Lt. William E. Safford, USN. Photograph taken about 1898. As aide from August 1899 to August 1900 to the first U.S. naval governor of Guam, Captain Richard P. Leary, Safford was in effect the first American lieutenant governor of the island. He wrote the first English-language textbook on the Chamorro language and the first two books in English on the plants and history of Guam. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>survey the ocean floor for a trans-Pacific submarine telegraph cable. The Nero discovered the deepest canyon on earth, the Marianas Trench. This canyon begins approximately 200 miles east of Saipan and curves south to its deepest point 36,198 feet below sea level some 210 miles southwest of Guam be- yond the Santa Rosa Reef in an area later called the Challenger Deep.</p>
                <p>On August 16, 1899, Leary issued his first two executive general orders on Guam. Order Number 1 prohibited the sale “of any intoxicating spiritu- ous liquors...to any person who was not a resident of this island.” The second order prohibited the importation of any liquors without a license. Like the prohibition of alcohol elsewhere, these orders were impossible to enforce, and alcoholic beverages</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>continued to be mysteriously available. Leary subse- quently had to issue another order forbidding resi- dents or visitors (meaning American marines and sailors) from obtaining tuba or aguardiente from the locals because fights broke out as a consequence, he noted, of “drunkenness.” Despite official efforts, the problems of alcohol and of military-civilian re- lations would never be completely solved on Guam.</p>
                <p>The new governor went on arbitrarily issuing civ- il orders, usually with Safford drafting the language in both English and Spanish. Order 3 halted all land sales until a new registry system was established by Safford. Order 4 prohibited celebrations and pro- cessions in villages on patron-saint feast days. Leary even halted the customary tolling of church bells in the morning and evening. With Order 5, Leary sup-</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>pressed “the existing system of concubinage,” and all couples “living together out of the bounds of wedlock are...to be married...in order that their children may become legitimate.” Leary instructed Safford to perform divorces and ordered local jus- tices of the peace (the gobernadorcillos) to perform civil marriages, regardless of church views. It was becoming evident to the Chamorros that the intent of many of these orders was to restrict the Catholic Church and to change local customs, not just to re- form laws or governmental procedures.</p>
                <p>Leary considered the remaining Spanish priests a problem because they condoned concubinage and themselves fathered illegitimate children. In August 1899, he ordered the Recollects expelled despite their pleas to Safford to remain. In September, Fa- ther Resano and another Augustinian departed for Saipan, where Resano was assigned as provincial vicar. Later the same day, the last Augustinian Rec- ollects on Guam departed on the collier Nanshan when it left for the Philippines. The priests’ com- mon-law wives and children remained on Guam with the mothers’ families. Father Palomo was per- mitted to stay, probably at Safford’s request and be- cause he was a Chamorro.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the U.S. Marines were get- ting tired of pick-and-shovel work. Leary had the troops digging sewers, repairing roads, working on the governor’s residence, and cleaning up the main Agana plaza for a parade ground. Trained for com- bat and unaccustomed to manual labor in a tropi- cal climate, forty-seven resentful marines refused to report for work detail. They asked that “natives” be hired for the work. Furious, Leary assembled all the marines the next morning and reprimanded them for their “mutinous, disgraceful conduct.” Accord- ing to one marine, Leary grimly threatened to shoot them, stating, “I have the law. I am supreme.” The marines went back to work.</p>
                <p>Owing to the “licentious and lawless conduct” of the marines, Leary issued Order 11, admonish- ing all Americans that “the natives of Guam are not ‘damned dagoes, nor niggers,’” as marines and sailors at times derisively called them. Nonetheless, the marines continued to cause serious problems</p>
                <p>113</p>
                <p>(the next governor described some as “vicious and refractory characters”). A naval engineer on the is- land, Leonard M. Cox, wrote in 1904 of this early period of U.S. rule: “Colonies were a new thing to us....Our troops, new to conquest and familiar with only one race other than their own... were in many cases lawless and turbulent.”</p>
                <p>While the Americans were getting established on Guam, the Germans replaced the Spaniards in the islands in Micronesia ceded by Spain to Germany. In November 1899, the German “district cap- tain” for the Northern Marianas, Georg Fritz, ar- rived aboard the warship Kudat at Saipan, where he would serve energetically for eight years. Two weeks later, the last Spanish officials, along with the Macabebe troops, departed the Mariana Islands. For the next forty-two years, Guam as an Ameri- can colony would have a history separate from the rest of Micronesia under the Germans and then the Japanese. The artificial—in terms of culture and ge- ography—separation of the Marianas into two po- litical entities endures today even though both are now under American sovereignty.</p>
                <p>In the meantime on Guam, Governor Leary re- ported to the Navy Department with satisfaction that he had “disposed of the priests who were the ringleaders in encouraging vicious and demoralizing habits and customs.” What Leary did not know was that the navy was releasing his reports to the Ameri- can press. American Catholics all over the country angrily protested Leary’s orders.</p>
                <p>The Catholic archbishop of New Orleans, who was also apostolic delegate to all the new U.S. ter- ritories, wrote Leary and asked to visit Guam on his way to the Philippines. Leary at first agreed and then reneged because of what he considered the “ex- traordinary egotism and officiousness displayed” in a second letter from the archbishop, which request- ed Leary “to revoke all orders issued...depriving the people of their legitimate religious liberty.” As a result of the uproar, General Otis in the Philippines ordered an army major general, Joseph Wheeler, to inspect conditions on Guam en route back to the mainland. The elderly Wheeler, known as “Fight-</p>
                <p>114</p>
                <p>ing Joe” from the Civil War, had been Teddy Roos- evelt’s divisional commanding officer in Cuba in 1898 and was highly respected. Despite Wheeler’s reputation, Leary objected to the visit as an un- warranted army intrusion in a navy command. He was then instructed by his own superiors to receive Wheeler, but he was to “decline to recognize his in- structions as official.”</p>
                <p>While Leary awaited Wheeler, Leary moved into his newly renovated Agana residence with colonial pomp equal to any Spanish governor. Safford wrote of Leary’s arrival in Agana, “He brought with him the band from the Yosemite....The Governor’s steward and house servants are enlisted mess-Jap- anese. He has a pair of white stallions which he bought in Manila, and a Filipino coachman to drive them. He has a fine outfit of table-linen, silver, por- celain, and glassware.”</p>
                <p>The American newcomers wore different uniforms, spoke a different foreign language, and had more cash than the Spaniards, but, like the Spaniards, they also brought disease to Guam. By December 1899, typhoid fever was widespread. Six marines died the first year, along with a number of Chamorros.</p>
                <p>In a proclamation on January 1, 1900, Governor Leary started the twentieth century off on Guam by abolishing peonage. This reform eliminated the practice whereby the poor manak‘papa paid debts to the Agana elite manak‘khilo (by now also called manak‘Hagatna or manak‘ ge‘hilo‘) by labor that sometimes lasted years. By February, after six months on Guam, Leary had issued fourteen execu- tive general orders and three proclamations, most of them reforms of Spanish laws.</p>
                <p>As Cottman had proposed originally in his report of 1899, Leary set up a public education system under naval control in place of the church school system, but, owing to the lack of teachers after the priests departed, only a few schools remained open initially. He prohibited religious instruction in schools, ordered all adult residents to learn to write their names, and urged everyone to learn English. Instruction in schools was to be in English, as soon as enough teachers were available.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>In February 1900, Major General Wheeler arrived. Leary let Safford escort the unwanted guest, along with Wheeler’s secretary and a Harper’s Weekly correspondent, around the island for most of the four days the group was on Guam. A contingent of Chamorros, including Father Palomo, gave Wheeler a flowery petition in Spanish that requested Safford (who knew nothing about it) be named governor if Leary was to be replaced.</p>
                <p>While on Guam, Wheeler issued no instructions. He carried the Chamorro petition to Washington but did not mention it in his report. The report was largely descriptive and noted only that “the orders with regard to religion are evidently considered as a hardship and are distasteful to a majority of the peo- ple.” As a consequence of Wheeler’s mild assessment, no changes were made by Washington, D.C., with regard to Guam, and Leary stayed on. Complaints by American Catholics subsided. In a brief but sig- nificant letter in February, Leary requested that the official name for the island be “Isle of Guam, Pacific Ocean,” in place of “Ladrones Islands.” Washing- ton eventually accepted the change in 1908 with the added designation “Mariana Islands.”</p>
                <p>Health conditions on Guam began to improve as drainage systems, a water distillation plant, and water storage tanks were constructed. Leary insti- tuted and enforced garbage collection and required outhouses as toilets in the main villages. Treatment by navy doctors started to reduce infection among the islanders of syphilis, tuberculosis, and a horribly disfiguring disease thought to be syphilis or leprosy but later diagnosed as gangosa, a form of tertiary yaws. In March, Leary reported that Guam’s first telephone system was installed between Agana and Piti. He asked Washington to authorize a military commissary and a post exchange, and these would later be established permanently on Guam.</p>
                <p>In an order reminiscent of Spanish galleon days, Washington, D.C., instructed U.S. Army Transports (USATs) steaming to the Philippines from San Fran- cisco via Hawai‘i to stop at Guam on the westward leg with people, mail, money, and supplies. On the eastbound leg from Manila to San Francisco, the army transports followed the shorter great circle</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>route directly across the north Pacific, just as had the Spanish galleons. An army transport stopped in Apra Harbor every one to three months. The transports were usually met a mile or so outside the harbor by small boats to sell fresh fruit to the passengers and crews as the Chamorros had done with Spanish galleons. This line of communication would continue until World War II.</p>
                <p>One problem on Guam that surprised Safford was how local officials defrauded their own people. Two elderly women walked all the way from Merizo to Agana with an appeal against their gobernadorcillo. This official had altered the land title of one of the women to reduce the size of her property and dis- pose of the land gained. He had arrested the son of the other woman for stealing coffee plants when in fact it was the gobernadorcillo himself who stole the valuable plants. Leary removed the gobernador- cillo from office, and Safford went on to grant over 1,000 fee simple titles of land to Chamorros under a new system of surveying and registration that he initiated on the basis of Spanish records. Nonethe- less, land frauds would recur on Guam. However, no income tax would be imposed on local residents under U.S. rule until 1950.</p>
                <p>Like other aspects of the American occupation that sowed the seeds of future problems on Guam, the local judicial system was initially left under Spanish laws and procedures and replaced piece- meal by measures based at times on American laws but more often on immediate naval operational needs. The most troublesome administrative prob- lem for Leary and all later U.S. naval governors, just as under the Spanish governors, was inadequate funding for Guam. Eventually, the U.S. Congress began to appropriate funds for Guam through the navy budget, but it was invariably stingy. When funds were available, the navy gave priority in the Pacific to bases at Pearl Harbor and at Cavite and Olongapo in the Philippines, not Guam. One his- torian later commented that Congress “showed a curious indifference to the affairs of Guam, while it succored the Philippines and Puerto Rico.”</p>
                <p>Leary requested another U.S. Marine battalion for Guam, but it was not sent. Frustrated, Leary asked</p>
                <p>115</p>
                <p>for reassignment. In his last edict, Order 21, Leary prohibited public appearances in the nude by “males of the Caroline Islander’s community.” There were still ninety-six Carolinians at the village of Maria Cristina (today’s Tamuning) living in their tradition- al style. Female Carolinians presumably could still appear nude in public. The same order also forbade cockfighting, the main sport on Guam. This order was as impossible to enforce as were earlier ones that attempted to discourage gambling and alcohol.</p>
                <p>In July 1900, Captain Leary was relieved as gov- ernor and as naval station commandant by Com- mander Seaton Schroeder. Safford was replaced by Ensign A. W.Pressey, who also spoke Spanish. Be- fore departing, Safford gave away his furniture and household items and most of his land to his Chamor- ro servants and friends, selling only the San Ramon Hill property. When he and Captain Leary departed on the Yosemite for Cavite in August 1900, Safford wrote in his diary, “As the ship weighed anchor and sailed away I felt real grief, as though leaving people of my own blood. I shall always look back upon the year spent on this lovely island as one of the happi- est in my life.”</p>
                <p>Back in the United States, Leary—still a captain and disappointed with his dull new assignment in command of a ship in the Philadelphia Navy Yard— died in 1901 of heart disease. Safford resigned from the navy in 1902 and became a curator at the Na- tional Herbarium in Washington, D.C. He earned a Ph.D. in 1920 and pursued a career as a botanist, ethnologist, and philologist. He wrote eighty pub- lished works, including the first English text on the Chamorro language (dedicated to Father Palomo) and two books about the plants and the history of Guam. Modest and intellectually inquisitive until the end, William Safford died in 1926 without re- turning to the island where he had served the lo- cal people and his own government with quiet distinction.</p>
                <p>The Practice of Manifest Destiny</p>
                <p>Governor Seaton Schroeder was more like Safford than Leary in his approach to the administration of</p>
                <p>116</p>
                <p>Guam. He spoke French and Spanish, and within a month he allowed celebrations once more of saints’ feast days in the villages and abolished ecclesiastical tribunals, which Leary, for all his anti-Catholicism, had neglected to eliminate. Within a year, the gov- ernor permitted the return of Catholic priests, three Spanish Capuchins. Schroeder was joined by his wife, Maria, and their children, the first American military family on Guam. American military wives soon established in Agana a social circle that mir- rored the protocol and traditions found on U.S. naval bases in that period. Some members of the upper-class Chamorro families of Agana were in- cluded in this small, elite society.</p>
                <p>Navy doctors believed the mortality rate among Chamorro infants and mothers was too high. As a remedy, Governor Schroeder in November 1900 ordered all Chamorro midwives (pattera) to take a course of instruction in modern hygiene and to ob- tain midwifery licenses. These arbitrary steps trod on long-standing traditional customs that not even the Spaniards had intruded upon. Chamorro wom- en resisted navy orders concerning birth practices for years.</p>
                <p>Many Chamorros also feared the new medical procedures the navy introduced, and it was difficult to get the seriously ill to remain in the hospital, par- ticularly women. The islanders still preferred home cures or folk remedies by the surubanus and suruha- nas. Nonetheless, the high Chamorro mortality rate began to decline. Outpatient treatment also began to reduce common afflictions such as “dhobie itch” (ringworm) and “lumbricoid worms” (mostly in- testinal hookworms and also tapeworms). Accord- ing to naval physician J. E Leys, hookworms were a “veritable curse in this community.”</p>
                <p>The American doctors also found Chamorros infected with the degenerative neurological disease called locally lytico-bodig. The first death certifi- cate under the U.S. naval government for this dis- ease was in 1902. Initially it was called “progressive muscular atrophy” by the Americans and later amy- otrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), known later in the United States as Lou Gehrig disease after the popu- lar baseball player who died of it in 1941. The navy</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>doctors were unable to prevent or cure the disease, which lingered on.</p>
                <p>The new governor was rudely introduced to the hazards of the western Pacific when on November 13, 1900, a monstrous supertyphoon slammed into the island. A marine in Agana gave an eyewitness account:</p>
                <p>The sea rose three feet in the streets, carrying build- ings, trees and bridges away. Roads were torn up by falling trees, and only four stone buildings remained standing. The wind was very strong, blowing at the rate of 140 miles an hour, lifting the corrugated iron roof of the Governor’s palace and carrying it out to sea....It was a pitiful sight to see men, women, and children out in the streets crying; mothers with ba- bies in their arms looking for shelter.</p>
                <p>At Apra Harbor, the Yosemite was at anchor with its engines disassembled for overhaul when the storm swept in. The ship’s anchor lines parted, and the fierce winds drove the Yosemite over the Calalan Bank and out to sea, killing five sailors. The collier Justin put to sea the next day and found the Yosemite drifting helplessly northwest of Guam. The Justin’s crew showed extraordinary heroism in the rescue of the sailors still on the Yosemite and in transferring $60,000 in Mexican gold coins to the collier. The Yosemite could not be towed, so the crews opened the sea valves, and the ship sank. It was the first American military vessel to join the many sunken Spanish ships in the deep blue waters off Guam. A replacement, the USS Supply, reached Guam in Jan- uary 1903 and would remain until November 1917.</p>
                <p>Thirty-four Chamorros died in the supertyphoon of 1900, with twenty-eight of these killed in Ina- rajan when enormous waves engulfed the village. Devastation was so widespread that Schroeder dis- patched the Justin to Cavite for food and supplies. Schroeder wrenched his shoulder in a fall during the typhoon, and the stress may have made him touchy. In January 1901, he deported all ninety-six of the Carolinians living in Maria Cristina. They had stub- bornly refused to clothe themselves as ordered by Leary. Unlike European visitors to Guam in the Spanish period, who viewed Carolinians as noble</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>savages and disdained the Hispanicized Chamorros, the Americans held the opposite view. Schroeder wrote that the Carolinians were a “very low order of human animal...[who] contributed nothing to the welfare of the Island.” So he sent them all to Saipan, where German governor Georg Fritz wel- comed them into the community of Carolinians still living there since Spanish times.</p>
                <p>While the inhabitants of Guam were adjusting to U.S. military rule, the people of the Philippines had been waging war to get rid of the Americans. Most Americans have now forgotten the brutal and bloody subjugation of Filipino guerrillas fighting in the period 1898-1902 for independence of the Phil- ippines. In that insurrection 4,374 American sol- diers died (ten times as many as died in Cuba dur- ing the Spanish-American War) and about 16,000 Filipino guerillas and at least 20,000 Filipino civil- ians were killed. The Philippines, which had been an economic and largely peaceful asset for Spain for two centuries, never fully recovered from the American colonial occupation and subsequent ef- fects of World War II. One commentator wrote in 2006: “As in other parts of the world, Washington’s fear of radicalism led it to support an oligarchy that was more interested in stealing money than in devel- oping the country. The United States did bequeath to the Filipinos a form of democracy, but when the archipelago was finally allowed to go its own way in the 1990s [when U.S. bases were finally closed], it was as poor as it was unstable.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Guam felt the impact of the unsuc- cessful Filipino war for independence after the U.S. Army captured the rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo and other principal insurrectionists in February 1899. Aguinaldo subsequently took an oath of al- legiance to the United States, was imprisoned for a time, and then freed. Other Filipino prisoners, how- ever, refused to take the oath, notably the brilliant Apolinario Mabini, who had a paralytic disability. The American commander, Major General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. (father of General Douglas MacAr- thur), sent these irreconcilables to Guam, just as the Spaniards had done with their Filipino rebels.</p>

                <p>In January 1901, thirty-four insurgent Filipino prisoners with fourteen servants arrived at Apra Harbor aboard the USAT Rosecrans. A week later, eleven more prisoners from Ilocos arrived on the USS Solace. Among the Rosecrans prisoners were Mabini, his brother Prudencio, and five generals. Governor Schroeder had his marines and the prisoners erect tents as a temporary prison on the shore near Asan.</p>
                <p>The exiles were allowed freedom to socialize with Americans and Chamorros, as Mabini wrote in his memoirs. On July 4, 1902, the United States offered a pardon and amnesty to all Filipino insur- gents who would take an oath of allegiance to the United States. Mabini and General Artemio Ricarte refused, but others accepted and departed Guam in September 1902 for Manila on the USAT Sheridan. Three men opted to remain on Guam.</p>
                <p>In February 1903, after two years of imprison- ment, Mabini and Ricarte were finally allowed to return to Manila on the USAT Thomas. The prison camp at Asan was closed the same month. In Ma- nila, before disembarking from the Thomas, Mabini took the oath of allegiance. Ricarte, however, again refused and was deported, eventually settling in Ja- pan, recalcitrant to the end. Mabini, a tragic hero to his countrymen, who called him the “Sublime Para- lytic,” died of cholera three months after his arrival back in Manila. He was only thirty-eight years old.</p>
                <p>The three former insurgents who chose not to re- turn to the Philippines were the teacher-lawyer Leon Flores (who founded a prominent Guam family), the lawyer Pancracio Palting (a future judge), and a young cook, Maximo Lorenzo Tolentino (who married a Chamorrita, Tomasa Crisostomo Lizama, and raised a large family on Guam). Decades later, on July 4, 1961, the Filipino community erected on the Asan site a memorial to Filipino patriots held prisoner on Guam. The invocation at the ceremony was by Monsignor Felixberto Camacho Flores, son of Leon Flores. Proudly present was the last survi- vor of the Filipino exiles, the eighty-five-year-old former cook Maximo Lorenzo Tolentino.</p>
                <p>Governor Schroeder had his staff conduct a census of Guam in August 1901. He reported the popu-</p>
                <p>118</p>
                <p>lation as fourteen American civilian citizens, 9,630 “citizens” of Guam, and thirty-two aliens (mostly Spaniards), for a total of 9,676 people on the is- land. There were actually more since he did not in- clude U.S. military personnel in the report. These averaged about 158 in this period, mostly marines. Schroeder’s census showed that the population of Guam had increased by almost 20 percent since Governor Olive’s count of 8,199 inhabitants fifteen years earlier in 1886.</p>
                <p>In late December 1901, the Chamorros of Guam presented another petition to the Americans. Thirty- two prominent island men requested Washington to send a commission to Guam to study ways to create a permanent civilian government on the island. The petition noted, “It is not an exaggeration to say that fewer permanent guarantees of liberty and property rights exist now than under Spanish domain.”</p>
                <p>Schroeder (who had already asked for a commis- sion to study Guam’s laws) endorsed the petition. The islanders described navy rule as “a military gov- ernment of occupation,” which should end since the war was over. By 1901, they feared that the naval government might become permanent. Their fears were justified; the Navy Department disapproved of any commissions to study civil issues.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, in 1903 the U.S. Senate passed a bill for a new government on Guam in partial response to the petition. The House of Representatives let the matter die, mainly because of navy objections. The Chamorro petition of 1901 was the first in a long series of proposals that sought normal civil liber- ties and representative government for the people of Guam within the American federal system. The U.S. Navy blocked all of these proposals until 1950.</p>
                <p>The navy’s absolute authority on Guam was con- firmed indirectly but definitively in 1901 by the U.S. Supreme Court in four cases that concerned the newly acquired American insular territories. Collec- tively referred to as the Insular Cases, these arose over the Foracker Act of 1900, which established new tariff laws and a civil government in Puerto Rico. A major issue was whether constitutional re- strictions (such as the Tenth Amendment) on con- gressional authority over the U.S. states also served</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 7</p>
                <p>to check federal power over the new island acquisi- tions, which were now called “flag territories” or “possessions.”</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court decided by a narrow five to four decision in the key case, Downes v. Bidwell, that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the in- sular territories as it does to the states. This deci- sion confirmed that the U.S. Congress has “plenary power” (unlimited authority) over all U.S. territo- ries under Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 2 (called the Territorial Clause) of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>The reasoning of the majority was unabashedly Victorian as expressed in the opinion of Justice Henry B. Brown: “If these possessions are inhabited by alien races, differing from us in religion, customs, laws, methods of taxation and modes of thoughts, the administration of government and justice, ac- cording to Anglo-Saxon principles, may for a time be impossible.”</p>
                <p>In a concurring opinion, Justice Edward D. White established a new territorial doctrine for the United States by making a distinction between “incorpo- rated” and “unincorporated” territories. An in- corporated territory is treated as part of the United States and may become a U.S. state. An unincorpo- rated territory, in contrast, is not “an integral part of the United States,” according to Justice White, and thus not intended to become a U.S. state. The Insular Cases also clarified the distinction between “organized” and “unorganized” territories. Unor- ganized territories are those that have not received an “organic act” from the U.S. Congress to estab- lish local self-government. Guam would be an unor- ganized territory until the 1950 Organic Act, but it remained an unincorporated territory. The “Territo- rial Doctrine” established by the Insular Cases re- mains the basic law governing relations between the U.S federal government and American possessions.</p>
                <p>It is worth noting a dissenting opinion in the In- sular Cases by Justice John Marshall Harlan:</p>
                <p>Whether a particular race will or will not assimilate with our people, and whether they can or cannot with safety to our institutions be brought within the operations of the Constitution, is a matter to be thought of when it is proposed to acquire their ter-</p>
                <p>THE ANGLO-SAXON WAY 1898-1903</p>
                <p>ritory by treaty. A mistake in the acquisition of ter- ritory, although such acquisition seemed at the time to be necessary, cannot be the ground for violating the Constitution or refusing to give full effect to its provisions.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for the people of Guam, Justice Harlan’s opinion did not become law. With consid- erable understatement, the U.S. attorney general in- formed the U.S. secretary of the navy in 1904 that, as a result of the Insular Cases, “the political status of these islands is anomalous. Neither the Consti- tution nor the laws of the United States have been extended to them.” In other words, the navy could run the island as it wished.</p>
                <p>In June 1902, Schroeder established a leprosarium at Tumon Bay, where twenty-five persons suffer- ing from gangosa, yaws, and Hansen’s disease (leprosy) were involuntarily isolated. The distinc- tions between these diseases were unclear to the navy doctors at the time, and all were thought to be infectious. This camp lasted until 1912, when all remaining lepers were shipped to a leprosarium on Culion Island south of Manila. Thereafter until World War II, all lepers on Guam were sent to Cu- lion for treatment. Most of these unfortunates died there. The navy’s isolation of the victims angered Chamorros, who traditionally cared for them at home.</p>
                <p>Normal life on Guam was disrupted violently on September 22, 1902, when a tremendous earth- quake struck the island. The Agana church lost its</p>
                <p>119</p>
                <p>bell tower once more, and one of the church walls collapsed. Bridges on the Agana-Piti road caved in, along with many coral masonry structures on the island. The Umatac church was again left a pile of wooden rubble, just as in the great 1849 quake. Tremors continued for an entire week, and public schools were closed for nearly two years. The extent of damage caused Schroeder to implement new con- struction standards to make buildings safer.</p>
                <p>In the period 1901-1902, a topographical sur- vey of Guam was done by a young naval civil en- gineer, Leonard M. Cox, who was chief of public works. Schroeder later had Cox write a description of Guam based on Cox’s observations and Safford’s writings. Schroeder persuaded the navy to pub- lish the ninety-five-page study in 1904. It became the standard guide in the pre-World War II era for Americans assigned to Guam. It was updated and republished in 1917 and 1926. In his original 1904 report, Cox noted that the people of Guam desired a civil government under a civilian governor and that they sought U.S. citizenship. That part of the original report was not included by the navy in later editions.</p>
                <p>In February 1903, Schroeder’s tenure as governor ended. By then the legal basis and the military ratio- nale for U.S. naval authority on Guam were firmly established. Until World War II, the island would be administered as if it were a warship, the “USS Guam,” with the governor as captain, American military personnel as crew, and the Chamorros as mess attendants.</p>

                <p>1903-1918</p>
                <p>American Outpost</p>
                <p>From February 6, 1903, until December 10, 1941, Seaton Schroeder was followed by over two dozen sometimes capable and sometimes obtuse American naval officers as governors and acting governors of Guam. These naval chief executives usually served short tours of duty, averaging only one year and five months each on Guam. Tours for American officers and enlisted men were deliberately kept short be- cause of the unhealthy climate and poor living con- ditions on Guam in those days before air-condition- ing. Officers received 10 percent additional salary and enlisted men 20 percent more as hardship pay for service on the island.</p>
                <p>The short tours of American governors contrasted with the longer tenures of the sixty-three Spanish chief executives after Father San Vitores. The Spaniards had averaged three and a half years each on Guam. As a consequence of their short tenures, American governors rarely became knowledgeable about local conditions or the island people. These men all held midlevel ranks, and thus for most of them Guam was only a brief, somewhat exotic step on a career ladder to higher rank. For the people of the island, the naval and marine officers and their wives seemed mostly a blur of tall, red-faced men in starched white uniforms and delicately complected women in full-skirted dresses and wide-brimmed hats.</p>
                <p>In the early 1900s, the daily life of the Chamor-</p>
                <p>I20</p>
                <p>ros still revolved around three basic elements: the extended family, the church, and a subsistence econ- omy based on farming family-owned lanchos and on some fishing. Every Monday morning there was a migration of whole families of Chamorros out of Agana and the villages to lanchos, some for a day or so, some for a week. Attachment to the land re- mained the bedrock of Chamorro commerce and family wealth. There were as yet few metal plows; planting was done mostly by hand. Everyone re- turned at the weekend to their villages for church services, socializing, and cockfights. An American journalist visiting in 1905 called Guam “a lump of oriental loveliness” and described the average Cha- morro as “less than a child, obstinately gentle, full of caprice...apparently wealthy, utterly poor.” A German expatriate and longtime Guam resident, Hermann Costenoble, wrote of the people of Guam, “As a matter of fact, everything that calls itself Chamorro has a wide and generous heart when ap- proached by love.”</p>
                <p>A striking aspect of U.S. Navy rule on Guam the first decade was how little different it was for or- dinary Chamorros from the previous Spanish mili- tary rule, other than the imposition of the English language and new governmental procedures, and the welcome elimination of polo labor. Technol- ogy, however, was changing rapidly in the 1900s,</p>

                <p>linking Guam closer to the United States and to the outside world. Under Schroeder’s successor, Com- mander William E. Sewell, Guam was connected by an undersea commercial telegraph cable to Manila in June 1903 and with Midway, Honolulu, and San Francisco a month later. This linkage completed the encirclement of the globe by cable, with a key way station at Sumay village.</p>
                <p>One of Governor Sewell’s major acts was to for- malize Guam’s judicial system and institute new land tax rates in 1903 to replace the old Spanish tax of 1 percent of assessed value. The new tax var-</p>
                <p>ied with the type of property and location but was higher in any case than 1 percent. The Chamorros at that time were “land rich but dollar poor,” and many did not have the cash to pay even this low property tax. The result was that, over the years, the naval government gradually acquired property through foreclosures for delinquent taxes, slowly alienating Chamorros from their land. Every year, “four to six titles, usually to poor land, reverted to the naval government,” wrote one observer. Japa- nese migrants began to buy the choicest crop lands, which had the highest taxes, from the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>122</p>
                <p>The need to improve Apra Harbor was dramati- cally demonstrated in March 1904, when the ca- bleship Scotia struck the Calalan Bank. The early morning sun blinded the captain and crew as the ship attempted to enter the harbor. The ship sank without loss of crew in shallow water not far from where the Spanish frigate Infante Don Carlos hit the same rocks and sank in 1814. These danger- ous “Spanish Rocks” were eventually covered after World War II by the huge breakwater constructed by the Americans over the Calalan Bank and Lumi- nao Reef.</p>
                <p>By the time of Governor George L. Dyer (May 1904-November 1905), governors were gener- ally required to obtain approval of the Navy De- partment before issuing orders on new policies for Guam, and the navy became increasingly inflexible on political matters. In 1905, the navy approved a change of the old Spanish titles of village officials to English versions. The four appointed district gober- nadorcillos became “commissioners.”</p>
                <p>A positive step by the navy was the creation in 1905 of a local civil service for islanders and Ameri- cans employed by the naval government. Under Dyer, the Maria Schroeder Hospital was enlarged with a new wing named after Susana Dyer, the governor’s wife, who obtained a $10,000 endow- ment for the hospital (later called the Susana hos- pital) from the Russell Sage Foundation. The new wing served only women and children for modest fees. Systemic instruction in midwifery was insti- tuted for native nurses in 1907 to help overcome the continued reliance on village pattera (traditional midwives). The enlarged facility became the Naval Hospital in Agana. To help staff the medical com- plex, American naval nurses began to be assigned to Guam in 1910.</p>
                <p>In 1905, Governor Dyer disbanded the Insular Artillery and replaced it with the Insular Patrol, composed of a dozen marine enlisted men under a marine officer who also served as chief of police. The marines were assigned to the island’s four dis- tricts, where they worked with the commissioners as police and also acted as foresters and game war- dens and even taught English and served as prin-</p>

                <head>CHAPTER 8</head>
                <p>cipals in village schools. A separate, small civilian police force of one sergeant and ten policemen, all Chamorros, served mainly in Agana.</p>
                <p>Because of imprecise property boundaries on Guam, Governor Dyer requested a detailed cadas- tral survey of the island and its waters by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Bureau. The U.S. Navy had acquired all Spanish crown lands when Guam came under American rule, but the precise sizes and locations of crown parcels were not clear. Crown property was initially estimated by the surveyor Cox to total about 105 square miles, or 67,200 acres, nearly half the island. Later estimates placed crown lands at about half Cox’s figure, that is, about 36,000 acres, or nearly one-quarter of the island’s 136,960 acres of land area. Dyer’s request was ap- proved, and piecemeal cadastral plots of Agana and other specific areas were surveyed. Topographic and hydrographic maps of the island were made sporadically over the coming years, but a thorough cadastral survey of the entire island has yet to be completed after more than a century of U.S. rule.</p>
                <p>In consequence, transfers of land titles on Guam have often been inaccurate and temptingly suscep- tible to fraud. By 1915, Governor William J. Max- well complained that land ownership “was the source of many crimes and scandals, family feuds, and much protracted litigation.” Poor land man- agement, questionable tax assessments and con- demnations, massive court litigation, and huge real estate swindles would occur in the decades ahead as consequences of inadequate cadastral informa- tion. Astoundingly, islandwide home mail delivery on Guam was still incomplete as of the year 2006 because many houses did not yet have numbered street addresses.</p>
                <p>It was in the year 1907 that racial segregation was officially instituted on Guam. Segregation of races under Jim Crow laws for schools, housing, and so forth had been legal in the United States since the Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Fergusen in 1896. On Guam, Naval Station Order 47 in 1907 decreed that the Navy Department “opposed marriages be- tween Marines and natives except in specially meri- torious cases which must be referred to the [navy]</p>
                <p>ORDERED TRANQUILITY 1903-1918</p>
                <p>Secretary.” Later, the order was extended to cover navy enlisted men as well.</p>
                <p>These efforts would fail to keep lonely marines and sailors on Guam from marrying Chamorritas in the coming years, even in cases that were not “specially meritorious,” whatever that meant. One of the first Americans to marry a Chamorrita was Marcelo Sgambelluri, a young musician in the navy band who in 1905 organized an all-Chamorro band. He married Joaquina D. Camacho, and the Sgam- belluri family is still prominent on Guam. A marine who was a village schoolteacher in 1903, Corporal James H. Underwood, also married a local woman, Ana Martinez. Another marine, First Sergeant John F. McDonald, married Dolores Mariano of Agana in 1908. These new Chamorro-American families, sometimes referred to as “American bamboo,” as- sumed increasing prominence in the decades ahead.</p>
                <p>While American naval administration of Guam was settling into routine military colonialism, the geopolitics of Oceania acquired new dimensions in the early years of the twentieth century. President McKinley won reelection in 1900, only to die from an assassin’s bullets in 1901. Vice President Teddy Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency and was re- elected in 1904. Under his big stick diplomacy, a new republic—Panama—was carved out of Colom- bia in 1903-1904 with American help to permit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct the Pan- ama Canal. Started in 1906 and completed in 1914, the canal would enable the U.S. Navy to operate in either the Pacific or the Atlantic, or in both. These developments locked Guam permanently into a line of communications for American military and com- mercial interests across the Pacific to the Philippines from the U.S. West Coast and Central America in almost a replica of the Spanish Pacific empire, just as Alfred Thayer Mahan had postulated.</p>
                <p>By this period, Japan was the dominant naval power in East Asia, but it lacked natural resources to continue its industrial growth. To obtain resources, Japan expanded in two directions: one into North Asia to gain access to the iron, coal, and other as- sets of Manchuria, and the other southward through</p>
                <p>123</p>
                <p>Micronesia to reach the tin, oil, and rubber of South- east Asia. Japanese companies began to dominate the copra industry and other commerce on Guam and in the rest of Micronesia. The Germans in Mi- cronesia, overextended and far from their European heartland, were not perceived by the Americans to be as much of a threat in the Pacific as the Japanese.</p>
                <p>On November 30, 1908, U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japanese Ambassador Takahira- Kogoro exchanged diplomatic notes that created an agreement by which the two countries pledged mu- tual respect for the status quo and for each other’s territories in the Pacific. Under the Root-Takahira agreement, the north-south line of communica- tions of Japan into Micronesia and the east-west line of American communications to the Philippines crossed peacefully, for the time being, in the western Pacific Ocean. This situation created the potential for confrontation as the two nations’ strategic inter- ests became increasingly competitive. Guam was at the geographic center of this premonitory Japanese- American rivalry in the western Pacific.</p>
                <p>As the new geopolitical scene unfolded in Ocea- nia, the U.S. Navy began in 1904 to ask for funds from the U.S. Congress to fortify Guam. To justify these requests, in 1906 the navy started to formu- late secret contingency war plans, each called “War Plan Orange,” which cast Japan (designated by the color orange; the United States is always blue in American war plans) as the enemy in a future war. A premise of the Orange Plans was that the U.S. Army would defend the Philippines until the U.S. Navy could carry reinforcements and supplies across the Pacific. The navy’s mission thus depended on hold- ing Hawai‘i and, if possible, Guam to secure the line of communications to the Philippines.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Army War College began to hold Blue- Orange war games in 1907. Simultaneously, Japa- nese naval planners were becoming aware of the strategic significance of Micronesia to Japan’s na- tional security. The first Japanese naval maneuvers in which the U.S. Navy was the hypothetical enemy were held in 1908, and in 1910 the Japanese began to draft their own battle plans to defeat the United States in case of war.</p>
                <p>124</p>
                <p>The American Plan Orange was revised repeat- edly, becoming joint army-navy plans, and in the 1911 version reasserted the “absolute necessity” of building heavily fortified bases at Hawai‘i and Guam. The American Congress, however, assumed that war in the Pacific was unlikely and repeatedly refused to provide money for any large-scale forti- fications on the American islands west of Hawai‘i. A corollary of the American Orange Plans and of navy policies in general was that any interference in military authority on Guam by civilian concerns was to be opposed in the interests of U.S. national security. The secret Orange Plans were not known to the people of Guam or the United States until af- ter World War II.</p>
                <p>To placate the navy and enhance island security at minimal cost, President William H. Taft issued an order in 1912 that Guam (along with Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Pearl Harbor, and Subic Bay) be closed as a port to all “foreign vessels of commerce... ex- cept by special authority.” This order was the first of several such edicts that would keep Guam isolat- ed from American and international commerce for the next fifty years, except for local trading ships, yet paradoxically would not prevent Japanese spy- ing on the island.</p>
                <p>On Guam, naval governors routinely came and went. In 1908-1910, Governor Edward J. Dorn, who stressed the Americanization of Guam, made American money the sole medium of financial ex- change, and in October the U.S. Congress autho- rized duty-free importation of Guam products into the United States and its territories. As an addi- tional protective measure, Dorn prohibited aliens from purchasing or leasing Guam land for peri- ods longer than five years. He wanted to curb the power of Japanese merchants, who, he reported, “still control the major part of the business of the Island.”</p>
                <p>Under Dorn the Guam Newsletter was initiated in May 1909. A monthly in both English and Span- ish, it was written by naval personnel. The Spanish- language portions were dropped in 1911. Wire ser- vice news came daily by telegraphic cable from San</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
                <p>Francisco and was censored before publication of any disastrous events or matters that threw a bad light on the United States. One of the paper’s first scoops was of the 1909 earthquake on Guam that destroyed the Susana Hospital and damaged the old Agana church, still in disrepair from the 1902 quake. The hospital was immediately rebuilt, but not so the church.</p>
                <p>In July 1910, Governor Dorn established the Is- land Court to replace the Court of First Instance. As since 1899, there were no trials by jury, and no deci- sions could be appealed beyond the island, even in capital cases. Maintaining law and order among the Chamorros was not a problem since all guns were strictly controlled, but by Dorn’s tenure the heavy caseload of the trial court had backed up, owing to the tangle of Spanish laws and navy civil orders. Despite the efforts of Dorn and later governors, the problem of inadequate police and judicial resources to cope with heavy legal caseloads would never be fully resolved on Guam.</p>
                <p>It was also in 1910 that a schism threatened the Catholic hierarchy on Guam. Back in 1907, the Vatican removed the Marianas from the Diocese of Cebu, and the islands were made an apostolic pre- fecture under a German Capuchin order. A German, the Reverend Father Paul von Kirchhausen, was appointed apostolic prefect that year; he resided in Saipan. In 1910, he attempted to appoint another German Capuchin, Father Peter Callistus Lapinot, to Agat. This provoked a local uproar. When Kirch- hausen arrived at Apra Harbor with Callistus, Dorn refused to permit the two German Capuchins to stay, and they returned to Saipan. This intervention in church matters earned Dorn sardonic acclaim in a poem by an anonymous member of the Civilian</p>

                <p>ORDERED TRANQUILITY 1903-1918</p>
                <p>To calm religious matters, in 1911 the Catholic Church separated Guam from the other Marianas and made it an apostolic vicariate under a Spanish Franciscan Capuchin order from Catalonia. In 1915, Monsignor (later Bishop) Felipe Joaquin M. Olaiz y Zabalza became the apostolic vicar; he served until 1934. Olaiz and all subsequent Spanish missionar- ies on Guam until World War II were conservative Basques from the Capuchin Order of Navarre.</p>
                <p>The acquisition of Guam had in the meantime at- tracted the attention of American Protestant mis- sionaries. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a Boston-based interdenomi- national agency that had successfully established missions in the Hawaiian Islands, Kosrae, and Pohnpei, sent five American Congregational mis- sionaries to Guam under the leadership of Reverend Francis M. Price and his wife. This dedicated little group founded a Protestant mission and church on Guam in 1901 with the help of, among others, Ma- jor Kelton of the U.S. Marines, the Vicente M. Tai- tano family of Santa Rosa, and two brothers, José and Luis Castro (sometimes called Custino), and their families.</p>
                <p>The Protestant community grew despite Catholic antipathy. The Congregationalists were replaced in September 1911 by Baptist missionaries under Rev- erend Arthur U. Logan and his wife, who would re- main for eleven years. Protestantism persevered and grew on Guam during the coming decades, with the Taitano family notably prominent in government, but the island populace remained overwhelmingly Catholic.</p>
                <p>By 1912 under Governor Robert E. Coontz, life on Guam for the Americans had settled into the placid colonial tedium of a small tropical outpost. Americans were beginning to find duty on the island rather pleasant. Coontz was a genial conservative who proposed few civil changes. He was, however, an energetic proponent of fortifying Guam. In this he was supported by the naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who declared, “Our every inter- est in the Pacific” could be secured by converting Guam into “a kind of Gibraltar.” Coontz went on</p>
                <p>125</p>
                <p>to become a four-star admiral and the chief of na- val operations, but neither he nor Mahan, who also became an admiral, could persuade Congress to for- tify Guam.</p>
                <p>It was under Coontz in 1912 that the old Agana church was torn down. The historic Spanish-built church had huge pillars of unhewn fil tree trunks as interior supports, but the structure was unsafe since the earthquakes of 1902 and 1909. Fierce typhoons in December 1912 and November 1913 delayed construction, and a handsome new domed cathe- dral, still named Dulce Nombre de Maria, was not completed until 1917 under the dedicated supervi- sion of Father Luis de Leon.</p>
                <p>Despite efforts at Americanization, by 1913 com- merce on Guam was still dominated by Japanese firms and merchants, notably by the Nambo Com- pany (Nanyo Boeki Kaishi, the South Seas Trading Company) and by José Katsuji Ogawa Shimizu on Guam. Shimizu, through his second Chamorro wife, Concepcion Torres as the legal land owner, acquired large tracts of land in 1911 for copra production on Guam. He became known as the “Coconut King of the South Sea,” and his descendants are still active in politics and business on Guam.</p>
                <p>To counter Japanese influence, the Navy Depart- ment in 1913 invited a San Francisco trading firm, Atkins, Kroll and Company, to establish a branch on Guam to grow copra and import American goods. The invitation was accepted by the firm’s head, Clif- ton H. Kroll, and the company set up an office in Agana and a warehouse in Piti in 1914. This resil- ient firm soon became the largest private business on Guam, and it would go on to diversify and sur- vive both World Wars I and II. The company con- tinues to serve the people of Guam into the twenty- first century.</p>
                <p>The health of the island people was still a prob- lem for the navy by the eve of World War I. In 1913, a measles epidemic with over 2,000 cases took more than three dozen lives, and, in 1915, whooping cough killed sixty Chamorro children. However, gangosa had been almost completely eradicated by this period.</p>
                <p>Regardless of persistent health problems among</p>
                <p>126</p>
                <p>the Chamorros, the material quality of life on the is- land was gradually improving. Since 1911 the navy had operated a small oil-fueled generator that sup- plied power for the radio station, telephones, and electric lights in Agana, mostly for American instal- lations and officers’ quarters as well as to down- town streetlights and some businesses. Baseball was becoming a favorite sport of Chamorro youths, even though the navy forbade use of the Chamorro language on the playing fields in order to encourage the use of English. A few Ford Model-Ts and motor- cycles chugged up and down Agana’s dusty streets, still surfaced only with crushed cascajo. One of the autos was owned by Frank Portusach, by then a well-off rancher.</p>
                <p>There were also by this period six “saloons” in Agana and sixteen “public women,” who depended “almost entirely on the enlisted force of the United States for their support,” according to the gover- nor’s report of 1915. These local prostitutes were given navy medical checkups every Monday and came to be known as “Monday Ladies.”</p>
                <p>Public education on Guam was expanding but remained inadequate. Schools were perpetually overcrowded owing to shortages of classrooms, particularly in the southern villages. There was no coeducation; boys went to school in the morning, and girls used the same classrooms in the afternoon. All students were given free periodic medical ex- aminations by naval doctors assisted by Chamor- ro practical nurses, a small number of whom were graduating each year from the Native Nurses Train- ing School established at Susana Hospital.</p>
                <p>English had largely replaced Spanish in schools, government offices, courts, and most businesses by 1914, but Chamorro was still the dominant lan- guage in local homes and gatherings. Employment in the government bureaucracy was becoming a ca- reer for more and more Chamorro men, so in 1914 Governor William J. Maxwell, an innovative but unstable executive, created a local retirement fund for the Guam civil service. Employees could obtain loans against their retirement accounts, a service that for the first time provided Chamorros some capital for major purchases and investments.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
                <p>Two local civilian wage rates evolved: one rate for American citizens, and a considerably lower one for Chamorros, even if they performed the same work. By 1912, a few Chamorro men had been permitted to enlist in the U.S. Navy, but only as mess atten- dants. Despite the racial inequity in navy hiring and the double standard in wage scales, and because the private sector paid even lower wages, government and miltary jobs with the prospect of retirement benefits became the mainstay of Guam’s economy.</p>
                <p>By this time the Chamorros were no longer grow- ing as much food on their lanchos. Governor Max- well noted unhappily, “The whole population is now almost wholly maintained directly or indirectly by the allotments from Appropriations, Navy, for the maintenance of the Naval Establishment.” To reduce this dependency on government, Maxwell proposed that Guam be made an open port for nor- mal commerce. His appeal was refused by higher authorities, who included by this period as assistant secretary of the navy a young, wealthy New Yorker named Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was also Roo- sevelt in 1914 who rebuffed a proposal by Maxwell that U.S. citizenship be considered for the people of Guam. As acting secretary of the navy, Roosevelt wrote, “The Department does not consider that the public interests make it desirable at this time to take up the general question of the citizenship of persons residing on Guam.” Roosevelt’s opposition “at this time” endured as navy policy for the next thirty-five years until the Organic Act of 1950.</p>
                <p>It was Governor Maxwell who one day at the end of June 1914 received the news of the assassination of an Austro-Hungarian archduke in Europe. Max- well did not know that the consequences of that distant event would soon bring a German warship to its demise on Guam and would drive him to a nervous breakdown.</p>
                <p>The Cormoran and Preparations for War</p>
                <p>The archduke’s assassination alerted the Japanese more than it did the Americans, or even the Ger- mans, to the potentialities of the oncoming war in the Pacific. The Japanese, having laid the basis of</p>
                <p>ORDERED TRANQUILITY 1903-1918</p>
                <p>their strategy by allying themselves with Great Brit- ain in 1902, quickly prepared in 1914 to displace the Germans throughout Micronesia with British backing. Following the outbreak of war in Europe in early August 1914, Japan declared war on Ger- many, and the Japanese navy swiftly seized the is- lands of German Micronesia. New Zealand troops took German Western Samoa, and Australian forces occupied most of German Melanesia.</p>
                <p>The rapidity and breadth of the Japanese occupa- tion of Micronesia stunned not only the Germans but also the Americans. Even the British were not pleased by their ally’s audacity. The entire balance of power in Oceania was altered, leaving the United States and Japan to face each other uneasily north of the equator and Britain and France with their dominions and colonies dominant south of that line.</p>
                <p>Little Guam was a neutral oasis in the swirl of war around it. It was not long, however, before Guam became involved when a thirty-foot cutter in near-sinking condition sailed into Apra Harbor in October with an exhausted crew of three German officers and four Papuan crewmen. They had voy- aged from Lamotrek Atoll in the Carolines. Their mission was to arrange for their mother ship, the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cormoran, to recoal at Guam. The Cormoran, formerly the Russian ship Riasan, a mail carrier out of Vladivostock before its capture by the Germans, was hiding at Lamotrek from the Japanese and desperately needed coal to escape from the Pacific.</p>
                <p>After dispatching the cutter to Guam to arrange for coal, Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt of the Cormoran kept his ship on radio silence at La- motrek for the next two months as the allied noose tightened around the few German ships still in the Pacific. When the cutter failed to return, and after friendly Carolinian canoe voyagers warned that the Japanese were converting nearby Truk into a major base, Zuckschwerdt decided to make a run for neu- tral Guam before the Japanese located him. In De- cember, with barely enough coal to reach the Mari- anas, the Cormoran steamed out of Lamotrek and headed north at top speed. On December 14, the</p>
                <p>127</p>
                <p>ship anchored in Apra Harbor with less than fifty tons of coal left.</p>
                <p>Captain Zuckschwerdt requested provisions and 1,500 tons of coal from Maxwell in order to steam to German East Africa for safe haven. When Max- well could only provide 200 tons of coal and limited provisions from Guam’s small stocks, Zuckschw- erdt resigned himself to internment. Neutral na- tions normally removed interned crews from their ships, but in this case there were no readily available facilities to house the Germans on Guam, so they remained aboard the Cormoran. Crew members were permitted ashore in uniform. These were mild restrictions. Maxwell was well aware that the 373 men on the Cormoran outnumbered the American marines on Guam. Highly disciplined, the German officers and sailors avoided any disorderly conduct as they settled down in early 1915 for a long stay.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of war in Europe and the Pacific had in the meantime stirred up considerable activ- ity on Guam. In March-April 1914, a joint U.S. Army-Navy Board visited the island to assess de- fense needs. As a result, War Plan Orange was re- vised with an estimate that, in case of war, 8,500 marines would be needed to defend Guam. It was assumed at the time by military planners that the reefs around the island would deter a massive en- emy invasion. As before, Congress did not authorize what the military proposed. Instead, the marine bat- talion was increased in early 1914 by only 200 men.</p>
                <p>Additionally, a new local military unit was formed, the Insular Force (not to be confused with the Insular Patrol, which was still functioning) to assist navy personnel at the port. Popular with Cha- morros, the Insular Force would grow in the coming years to over 100 men. Chamorros jokingly called them marinon mantiquilla (butter sailors) because they enlisted to obtain navy commissary privileges. Access to military commissaries and post exchanges with their reduced prices has been a powerful in- ducement for Chamorros to have at least one family member work for the military ever since the Ameri- cans took over Guam.</p>
                <p>Among the officers who arrived in 1914 with the joint U.S. Army-Navy Board was an exceptional</p>
                <p>German warship SMS Cormoran in- terned on Guam. Disguised as a mer- chant vessel, the Cormoran fled to Guam in 1915 to avoid Japanese fleets hunting her in German Micronesia after the out- break of World War I. While interned, her captain, Adalbert Zuckswerdt, enter- tained aboard. He is shown here with American military wives. In 1917 when the United States entered the war, the ship was scuttled by the Germans. Her remains still lie in Apra Harbor. (Cour- tesy of Herbert T. Ward, 1970)</p>
                <p>ORDERED TRANQUILITY 1903-1918</p>
                <p>marine officer who would become a legend, Cap- tain Earl Hancock (Pete) Ellis. After the board de- parted in May, he stayed on as police chief, in which capacity he was also head of the Insular Patrol and intelligence officer for the military command on Guam. Bright and innovative, but at times bizarrely nonconformist owing to alcoholism, Ellis in 1915 demonstrated the practicality of amphibious as- saults over reefs (a new concept at the time) by suc- cessfully landing a squad of marines by boat with a 4.7-inch gun and crossing the reef to Gab Gab Beach in Apra Harbor. These exercises revealed for the first time the vulnerability of Guam to seaborne invasion, if the invaders were well supported by off- shore naval gunfire.</p>
                <p>Ellis actively engaged in intelligence gathering for the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Ellis, as Guam’s ONI officer, posed as a businessman and reconnoitered Saipan, from which he theorized— correctly, as history would show—that a Japanese attack would be launched against Guam. Ellis also assigned one of his enlisted men in the Insular Pa- trol, a German-speaking corporal named Hans George Hornbostel, to determine if the German resident Hermann Costenoble was a German spy, as Ellis suspected.</p>
                <p>Costenoble, formerly of the German army, had settled on Saipan in 1903 and moved to Guam a year later. He became a prosperous farmer with stores in Agana, Piti, and Sumay. Hans dutifully be- friended the Costenoble family by dating one of the daughters, Gertrude. The young corporal confirmed that the father was indeed a German patriot and probably an agent for Berlin, but in the meantime Hornbostel fell in love with Gertrude.</p>
                <p>He decided to ask the father for Gertrude’s hand, but the old man, now suspicious of the young ma- rine, refused. The two lovers then eloped and were married by the Reverend Arthur Logan at the Prot- estant church in Agana beneath an arbor of cadena de amor (chain of love, Antigonon leptopus), a pink and white flowered vine introduced to Guam by the Spaniards from Mexico. Hans turned in his reports on Costenoble, but the governor allowed the father to remain free for the time being.</p>
                <p>129</p>
                <p>Ellis in the meantime was transferred back to the mainland, where he wrote a “Report of a Mili- tary Reconnaissance of the Island of Guam, 1914- 1915,” in which he concluded that Guam could be defended for a limited time and with great difficulty by a marine battalion if it retreated into strongholds on Orote Peninsula and in the Mount Tenjo area instead of trying to hold the beaches. Ellis would go on to become a combat hero in France after the United States entered the war, but this was not the last that Guam would see of him, or of Hans and Gertrude Hornbostel.</p>
                <p>World War I increased demand in Japan for coco- nut oil, and Guam’s copra production doubled from prewar sales of 1 million pounds annually. With the growth in the economy, Governor Maxwell estab- lished the Bank of Guam as a governmental entity in December 1915. The increased workload im- posed by the war began to affect Governor Max- well. High-strung with a short temper, he became autocratic. He prohibited whistling in public to stop Chamorro boys from mischievously whistling the wrong cadence when naval personnel were march- ing. His relations with his staff and with Captain Zuckschwerdt deteriorated.</p>
                <p>The stress apparently pushed Maxwell to a ner- vous breakdown. In April 1916, according to a terse statement in the Annual Report of 1916, “Captain W.J. Maxwell was relieved from duty on account of illness, and on May 12th he sailed for the United States.” He departed under a medical escort. After a brief interim of several acting governors, Captain Roy C. Smith became governor in May.</p>
                <p>Relations with the German internees immediately improved. The Cormoran’s excellent thirty-five- piece band began playing regular performances in the Plaza de Espafia and occasionally at the gover- nor’s residence. A typical morning at the plaza in 1916 was described by a resident:</p>
                <p>Guam was like the setting of a comic opera...there passed by, going about their business, American Naval officers in spotless white, Marine officers in white or khaki, German officers from the Cormo- ran in meticulous uniform, native men with their</p>
                <p>130</p>
                <p>shirt tails always hanging out, lovely women of the island tightly swathed from waist down in their gaily colored trained skirts with sheer bouffant blouses of pifia cloth, Marines in khaki, Franciscan monks in their brown cassocks and rope belts, American women carrying bright Japanese parasols, and Ger- man sailors on bicycles with ribbons dangling from their child-like straw hats.</p>
                <p>In January 1917, the U.S. Navy made a secret study titled “Strategic Problem, Pacific,” which revised the 1914 Orange Plan and estimated that 185,000 troops would be needed to defend Hawai‘i, Guam, and the Philippines. Later, Governor Smith recommended a defense force of 37,000 men on Guam alone, backed by 100 destroyers, fifty sub- marines, and six mine layers, to defend against a hypothetical invasion by 250,000 Japanese troops. The reefs were now acknowledged not to be a bar- rier to amphibious assaults. None of these fantastic estimates ever came close to being realized as de- mands in the Atlantic and in France took priority over the Pacific in American preparations for war.</p>
                <p>While naval strategists debated, Governor Smith, with Navy Department concurrence, took unprece- dented initiatives on Guam. In early 1917, he estab- lished the First Guam Congress. It was a unicameral body made up of thirty-four legislators who were commissioners, deputy commissioners, and other prominent Chamorros, plus three American officers ex officio, all appointed by the governor.</p>
                <p>The Guam Congress opened on February 3, 1917, with a speech by the governor. He suggested that the congress focus on local economic matters. The Chamorro members, however, immediately be- gan to debate political issues, as expressed boldly in a speech by member Tomas Calvo Anderson: “It is high time that there be granted to the people [of Guam], respectful, loyal, and devoted to the great American nation, the same rights that have been granted to the different States, territories and pos- sessions...that we may know whether we are to be members of the American people or their servitors.”</p>
                <p>The Chamorros received a negative reply from the navy in a special session of the Congress in March:</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
                <p>“.,.the Congress is intended as an advisory body to the Governor. Its recommendations should be limited to matters in the power of the Governor to regulate. Other matters cannot be even considered by the Governor.... Hence any power not within the power of the Governor to regulate cannot be con- sidered by him and is out of order in the Congress.”</p>
                <p>This circular but nonetheless clear message damp- ened the hopes of the Chamorros. The Guam Con- gress would continue to meet dutifully but unenthu- siastically to discuss village affairs once a month or so over the next fourteen years until it was dissolved in 1931. Inevitably, public interest in the power- less Guam Congress waned, and it became a rubber stamp for the governors, when it was not ignored by them.</p>
                <p>In March 1917, Governor Smith established the Guam Militia, and by June there were 920 enthusi- astic Chamorros in the militia’s sixteen companies, with one or more companies from each village. The whole force was under the commanding officer of the marines, and, extraordinarily, the troops were unpaid. As under the Spanish, the Chamorro men responded with zeal to a purposeful cause that orga- nized their otherwise unused energies.</p>
                <p>Relations between the Americans and the interned Germans continued to be correct and at times even more so. On January 1, 1917, an American naval nurse, Eleanore Blain, married Lieutenant Karl von Gebhard, an officer on the Cormoran. One hundred American, German, and Chamorro guests danced at the reception to music by the Cormoran’s band.</p>
                <p>The good feelings soured in February when U.S. diplomatic relations with Germany were severed as a result of U-boat attacks on American ships. It was becoming clear that the United States might soon be at war with Germany. Governor Smith imposed tighter restrictions on the Germans. In April, when Captain Zuckschwerdt learned that war would soon be declared against Germany by the United States, he secretly ordered that six drums of coal dust mixed with gasoline and armed with electrical blasting caps be hidden in the ship’s forward star- board coal bunker next to the hull. He then waited to see what the Americans would do.</p>
                <p>ORDERED TRANQUILITY 1903-1918</p>
                <p>Guam and World War I</p>
                <p>Captain Zuckschwerdt did not have long to wait. Early on the morning of April 7, 1917 (April 6 by Washington, D.C., time, which is nine hours behind Guam time), Governor Smith received a coded flash cable that war had been declared. As previously planned, the governor immediately dispatched Lieu- tenants Bartlett and William E Lafrenz to demand surrender of the Cormoran. At the Piti landing, the two lieutenants boarded the governor’s “barge,” actually a large, sleek mahogany speed boat, with an Insular Force crew and several armed marines under Lieutenant W.A. Hall to take over the Ger- man ship as a prize.</p>
                <p>As the governor’s barge set out, the prize party saw coming toward them the Cormoran’s daily sup- ply launch under the command of von Gebhard, who was given the duty so that he could visit with his American bride at the dock. On seeing who was in the governor’s barge, von Gebhard promptly turned back toward the Cormoran. The faster American boat pulled up parallel to the German launch, and Hall ordered Marine Corporal Michael B. Chockie to fire a shot across von Gebhard’s bow to halt him.</p>
                <p>Chockie stood up with his rifle and fired a shot. The Germans continued on until a second shot by another marine, apparently (this is a matter of con- troversy) Lieutenant Hall with his .45-caliber pistol, caused them to heave to. Hall and some marines then took the Germans to Piti in the Cormoran’s launch as prisoners of war while the barge went on. Only about two hours had elapsed since President Woodrow Wilson had signed the declaration of war. Therefore the shot by Chockie was the first one fired by an American in World War I. This action made the corporal something of a celebrity the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Bartlett and Lafrenz proceeded to the Cormoran, where Bartlett alone went aboard just before eight o’clock. He presented a brief letter to Zuckschwerdt from Smith that demanded “the im- mediate and unconditional surrender of the ship and personnel.” The German captain offered to turn</p>
                <p>131</p>
                <p>over his officers and men but said that he could not surrender the ship. Shrewdly, he then asked Bartlett to submit that offer to Governor Smith.</p>
                <p>Bartlett, put off by this unforeseen equivocation, saluted and left to deliver the offer to Smith. This was a mistake. While Bartlett was rejoining Lafrenz on the barge, Zuckschwerdt had all secret docu- ments burned and gave the order to abandon ship over the stern. Most of the crew was on deck. They cheered the captain and began jumping overboard, lustily singing their national anthem, “Deutschland, Deutschland, uber alles.” Zuckschwerdt then or- dered the switch to be thrown to blow up the ship.</p>
                <p>Bartlett and Lafrenz in the barge were moving away from the Cormoran as the cheering and sing- ing occurred. Suddenly, Bartlett later wrote, they felt the “dull heavy shock of a muffled underwa- ter explosion” against the bottom of the barge. Im- mediately, a mass of red flames, smoke, and debris shot with a roar up through the forward deck of the Cormoran, blowing away much of the bridge. Cap- tain Zuckschwerdt and the last of his officers then calmly climbed over the stern rail and swam away as the Cormoran swiftly sank beneath the waters of Apra Harbor.</p>
                <p>Boats from all over the harbor converged to pick up the survivors. Seven Germans died in the scut- tling. Six of the bodies were found and buried with military honors in the small U.S. Naval Cemetery in Agana near the beach where Father San Vitores had landed over two centuries earlier. The Germans lat- er erected next to the graves a cement obelisk with the inscription “Den Toten von $.M.S. Cormoran, 7 IV 1917” (To the dead of the SMS Cormoran, April 7, 1917). The meter-high obelisk still stands among the rows of tombstones and crosses in the nearly forgotten little cemetery now flanked by Marine Drive, a busy six-lane highway.</p>
                <p>The German officers were held at Camp Barnett and the enlisted crew at a camp at Asan, that favor- ite holding place on Guam. Corporal Hans Horn- bostel was then given the unpleasant task of ar- resting his German father-in-law, Herr Costenoble, and the old man was interned with the Cormoran crew. All the German prisoners were sent back to</p>
                <p>132</p>
                <p>the United States for confinement until their return to Germany after the war. Captain Zuckschwerdt eventually became a rear admiral in the German Navy in World War II. After its machinery and ar- mament were salvaged by navy hard-hat divers, the Cormoran was left on the bottom of Apra Harbor at 120 feet, where it remains today, a prime attrac- tion for scuba divers.</p>
                <p>After the dramatic scuttling of the Cormoran, life on Guam settled down again to ordered tranquility. A civic organization of Chamorro-speaking men, the Young Men’s League of Guam (YMLG), was organized in April 1917. The YMLG would work quietly to support Chamorro sports, culture, and identity over the next seven decades. The purposes of the YMLG, however, were hampered by Naval Government Executive General Order 243 in 1917, which designated English as the only official lan- guage of Guam and ordered that “Chamorro must not be spoken except for official interpreting.”</p>
                <p>In the July Fourth ceremonies in 1917, a new Guam flag was flown by the Guam Militia. Designed by Helen L. Paul, wife of a naval officer, and ap- proved by Governor Roy Smith, the flag has a blue field with a central emblem bordered in red in the elliptical shape of a Chamorro sling-stone. Within the sling-stone are a proa and a coconut tree on the beach at Agana with the word “Guam” in the center. Governor Lloyd S. Shapley asked for formal approv- al of it in 1929. Approval was granted, and in 1930 Governor Willis W. Bradley adopted the distinctive central emblem as the official seal of the island.</p>
                <p>World War I had little impact on the Chamorros of Guam. A “back-to-the-soil” program to expand farming was mounted by Governor Smith in 1918, but, like most agricultural promotions by naval authorities, the effort produced little. After nearly two decades of U.S. naval government, local cus- toms remained a conservative mix of neo-Chamor- ro and Spanish traditions beneath the governmental mantle of the Americans. The Guam News Letter of April 1917 complained that, after nineteen years of American rule, “very few inhabitants had learned to speak English.” The main change was that the old manak‘kilo families in Agana, whose ancestors</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
                <p>were Chamorro principales and Spanish mestizos, now had competition from families into whom the new rulers, usually military men, were marrying.</p>
                <p>In most Chamorro families, the mother was the treasurer to whom all unmarried working children obediently gave their earnings. Marriages were of- ten arranged by the parents, and surubanu herb doc- tors were routinely consulted for common ailments and pattera midwives still practiced in most rural villages despite naval efforts to replace them with trained nurses and doctors. Religious observances remained strict, with twenty-four-hour wakes. Many Chamorros still gave and received chenchule‘ gifts and practiced ika reciprocity and still avoided manual labor for the government while working hard on their own lanchos. Land and family lineage continued to be the basis of wealth and prestige, as described by a Chamorro historian, Reverend Joa- quin Flores Sablan:</p>
                <p>The caste system was an unwritten code, but it deter- mined the status of an individual in the society. The criteria by which a person was measured included wealth, family line, marriage with the ruling class, rental of church pews in the cathedral, the barrio of residence, and whether a person lived in a limestone- walled house or a wood-frame structure with sheet metal roofing. Land ownership was the greatest se- curity, particularly inherited properties which they treated as a sacred trust from their parents. To part with the land was the same as committing suicide.</p>
                <p>While Guam had been coping with the Cormo- ran, the Japanese were restricting trade by foreign businesses to their islands in Micronesia, just as the U.S. Navy had done earlier for Guam. Atkins, Kroll complained to Governor Smith that its copra trade in Micronesia was being blocked by Japan. After State Department protests to Tokyo, the Japanese allowed the Atkins, Kroll schooner Avarua to trade at Saipan, Truk, and Jaluit under tight controls. The U.S. Navy suspected that the Japanese wanted to hide military bases from prying foreign eyes, so the navy requested Governor Smith in September 1917 to “submit to ONI any information of interest in regard to activities of Japanese subjects...that may</p>

                <p>This surveillance improved in November 1917, when the navy installed new facilities with two tow- ers, each 400 feet high, at Libugon Hill for a high- powered radio station on Guam. The first small ra- dio station had been set up at Agana Heights back in 1906 and by World War I radio almost eliminat- ed cable as the means of official communications. Primarily a relay point between Pearl Harbor and Cavite for commercial and governmental messages, the Guam radio station would become an intercept</p>

                <p>In the meantime, ONI asked Clifton Kroll to have civilian employees of Atkins, Kroll report on Japanese activities and allow ONI agents to pose as crewmen on the Avarua to spy on the islands the schooner visited. Clifton Kroll agreed, and intelli- gence reports resulted, although in this period Japan was not yet seriously fortifying its newly acquired Micronesian islands.</p>
                <p>Military matters became secondary on Guam in 1918, when several disasters struck the island. On July 6, 1918, a huge typhoon hit Guam, killing two</p>

The lone palm tree at the mouth of the stream in the seal is based on the scene above the old outlet of the Agana River after the massive typhoon of 1918 destroyed all but the tree. A Chamorro proa was added, as was Urunao Point, in the background.</p>
                <p>persons. “Telephone and electric light lines were a mass of tangled wire,” according to the July 1918 Guam News Letter. Next, from late October to De- cember, one of the worst epidemics in Guam’s his- tory swept across the island. This was influenza; it was raging worldwide and was brought to Guam by the USAT Logan. On Guam the disease killed 858 people, or nearly 6 percent of the population, according to navy records. Many older Chamorros were victims, and one historian estimated that 80 percent of the Chamorros who spoke Spanish died in the influenza epidemic.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 8</p>
                <p>Perhaps because it was wartime, the governor downplayed the epidemic’s impact. The governor’s Annual Report of 1919 blandly asserted, “The general sanitary conditions have perceptibly im- proved.” Yet an American sailor wrote in Decem- ber 1918, “We are carrying them [the dead] past the house at the rate of about fifty per day.” The sailor’s letter was intercepted by navy censors in Honolulu and was never delivered. Later, President Woodrow Wilson acknowledged the seriousness of the epidemic on Guam when he awarded a medal to Father Roman Maria de Vera, one of the Spanish Capuchins, for his dedicated service in nursing hun- dreds of civilian and military victims of influenza on the island.</p>
                <p>With the terrible influenza still rampaging on the island, it is understandable why the armistice that ended World War I on November 11, 1918, was not officially celebrated by the governor on Guam. By then Smith was under severe stress as a result of wartime pressures. He was one of the more active naval governors, but the navy did not appreciate his initiatives such as the Guam Congress or his han- dling of the Cormoran. Smith began to feel as if he had been unfairly exiled to Guam while his fellow officers were fighting gloriously in the Atlantic and in Europe. His messages to Washington, D.C., were becoming close to incoherent when on November 15, 1918, the navy replaced him with Captain Wil- liam W. Gilmer.</p>
                <p>Early the next year, the Navy Department inves- tigated Smith’s tenure in a process reminiscent of the old Spanish residencias. The investigators con- cluded that Smith had been too innovative and too lenient in wartime conditions, mingling civil and military functions in a way that could have jeop- ardized the security of the island. In the history of the American naval governors of Guam, the Navy Department rewarded most those, such as Coontz, who changed things least.</p>

                <p>With the war over, the people of Guam and the American military personnel on the island hoped for a relaxation of wartime restrictions. This was not to be. Governor Smith’s replacement turned out to be a humorless autocrat. Worse, he was a rac- ist, not just personally, but in his official capacity as chief executive of the island.</p>
                <p>In less than two years on Guam, Governor Gil- mer issued over fifty stultifying general orders. He ordered, among other things, a halt to any whistling (Smith’s earlier order against whistling had been ignored by Chamorro boys), a halt to smoking, and institution of a preferential system by military rank for commissary purchases. He also ordered all military personnel “to be in their quarters by 11:00 p.m. and remain there until 5:00 a.m.” Nearly all the orders prescribed fines for disobedience.</p>
                <p>His EGO (Executive General Order) 312 in May 1919 decreed that all males on Guam were liable to a tax of twenty-five cents if they did not deliver five dead rat heads to their district commissioner each month. All governors, including the Spaniards, re- peatedly tried to eliminate the many rats on Guam, but without success. The repressive social atmo- sphere under Gilmer was made worse when the manufacture or consumption of alcoholic beverages became illegal in July 1918 when the Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition) to the U.S. Constitution</p>
                <p>passed. Bootlegging of aguardiente, “agi” to sailors and marines, soon became common despite efforts by the Insular Patrol to ferret out stills.</p>
                <p>It was during Gilmer’s tenure that Padre Palomo died of a heart attack in 1919 at the age of eighty- three. This fine priest had been a pillar of spiritual strength for generations of islanders. A small park next to the U.S. Naval Cemetery on the Agana shoreline was later dedicated as the Padre Palomo Park with a statue of the father.</p>
                <p>What provoked a public backlash against Gilmer was EGO 326, which he issued in September 1919. Back in 1907, the navy had tried to prevent military interracial marriages with Naval Station Order 47, but over the years it had given up on the matter as a lost cause. By September 1919, according to a letter by former marine James H. Underwood, then the postmaster of Guam (he served as postmaster from 1915 to 1941 and then after World War II), there had been sixty-three “white men who have married Natives of Guam.”</p>
                <p>Governor Gilmer decided to remedy what he saw as a failure of navy resolve on the marriage issue; he would crack down on the mixing of races. His EGO 326 stated, “It is hereby ordered and decreed that on and after October 1, 1919, any white person re- siding on the Island of Guam, is forbidden to marry any person whole or part of Chamorro or Filipino</p>
                <p>135</p>
                <p>136</p>
                <p>extraction.” Furthermore, common-law interracial marriages (which had been a routinely accepted practice on Guam for over two centuries) would be punishable as adultery.</p>
                <p>Gilmer’s decree immediately sparked howls of protest. Americans who were married to Cham- orritas and Filipinas fired off angry letters to the governor and to officials in Washington. A com- mittee was formed to fight the order, and forty-two prominent Chamorros signed a letter to the gover- nor with the demand “to have this discriminating law revoked.” The Guam Congress followed with a similar request. Even Bishop Olaiz, who person- ally disapproved of American servicemen marrying Chamorro women, objected to the order.</p>
                <p>Because of the backlash, Gilmer “temporarily suspended” the order while he referred the mat- ter to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Gilmer wrote to Roosevelt that inter- racial marriages created a new clique of Chamor- ro-Americans that “wields a powerful influence” and that men were leaving the service to remain on Guam with their wives.” While waiting for Roose- velt’s reply, Gilmer continued to issue ludicrous or- ders: one prohibited any dance, play, or “nocturnal revelries” after a curfew of 10:00 p.m.</p>
                <p>In March 1920, he ordered compulsory registra- tion of all residents of Guam, who were then issued a certificate of identification to be used for any transaction to do with the government. The effect of this order was to reduce the centuries-old Span- ish custom whereby each child bore the father’s family name first and the mother’s family maiden name second, as for example in Joaquin Torres y Martinez. By dropping the y, the navy gradually re- duced the practice of double names, with the result that some residents of Guam ended up with their mother’s family name. Chamorros keep their names straight by often referring to a family or clan name (familian) of a person, which may be different than baptismal or birth certificate names. They also cus- tomarily use terms such as Tan (Madame) and Tun or Tom (Sir) when referring to prominent persons, or Don or Dona for persons with official titles. Fur- thermore, Chamorros love nicknames and use them</p>
            </div>

                <head>CHAPTER 9</head>
                <p>frequently in place of formal names. World War II put a halt to the registration but not to the confu- sion among outsiders over Chamorro names.</p>
                <p>The marriage matter was resolved when Postmas- ter Underwood went to Washington, D.C., in early 1920 and met with the chief of naval operations. This official was none other than Robert Coontz, now an admiral. Embarrassed by Gilmer’s orders, Coontz promised to remedy them. In June 1920, Roosevelt sent Gilmer a telegram: “You will revoke EGO 326.” In July, Gilmer was relieved by Captain Ivan C.Wettengel. The new governor, an intelligent and fun-loving man, rescinded the 10:00 p.m. cur- few and Gilmer’s marriage and adultery law, there- by becoming instantly popular on the island.</p>
                <p>In 1920, the ten-year U.S. national census was taken on Guam. It showed a total population of 14,724, of whom 13,698 were “Natives.” This re- flected a 70 percent growth in the Chamorro popu- lation in the first twenty years of American rule. Of all the changes brought about by the Americans, the improvement of sanitation and medical services, which in turn reduced infant mortality and pro- longed lives, was proving to be the most beneficial to the local people, despite the erosion of traditional health practices.</p>
                <p>The main increase in military personnel on Guam in this period came in 1921, when a seaplane base was established at Sumay. Ten officers and ninety enlisted men of Flight L, Fourth Squadron (later called Scouting Squadron One), of the U.S. Marine Corps arrived in Apra Harbor with six seaplanes. The water landing strip for the planes was off Gab Gab Beach, as suggested years earlier by Pete Ellis, with a hanger, fuel tanks, and dock at Sumay. The presence of military aircraft on the island was an indicator of the changing technology of war that would reach a crescendo in World War II.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, external forces were once more shap- ing Guam’s destiny. In order to consolidate Japan’s control of Micronesia, Tokyo concluded a secret treaty in 1917 with Britain, France, and Russia whereby in the peace agreement for World War I those countries would support Tokyo’s claims in</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>Micronesia in return for Japan’s support of British, Australian, and New Zealand retention of German colonies south of the equator in the Pacific. When the Americans learned of this secret agreement in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference, the U.S. Navy objected.</p>
                <p>As a compromise, the British proposed that the former territories of Germany be divided into three kinds of mandates (A, B, and C, depending on state of development) and that these be administered by the occupying powers under the new international organization to be established—the League of Na- tions—by the peace treaty. President Wilson reluc- tantly agreed but demanded that the administering nations, such as Japan, agree to develop their man- dates, to open them to free trade, and to refrain from fortifying them. Since Guam and the other U.S. ter- ritories were not mandates, they were exempt from these conditions. This formula was accepted in the Treaty of Versailles signed in June 1919 that formal- ly concluded World War I.</p>
                <p>The former German islands in Micronesia be- came a Class C Mandate, the least developed, under which technically they were wards of the League of Nations, but in effect they became possessions of Ja- pan. A historian later described this arrangement as “a fig leaf for the annexation of the territories cov- eted by Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, while it preserved the fiction of guardianship by the League of Nations.”</p>
                <p>President Wilson still attempted to limit the Japa- nese presence in Micronesia by demanding that Yap, a key international cable station, be exempted from the League of Nations mandate and be internation- alized. The Japanese refused this unprecedented de- mand, and the “Yap crisis” provoked hysteria for a time in the U.S. press. American commentators indulged in an orgy of anti-Japanese books.</p>
                <p>One remarkable book in 1921, Sea Power in the Pacific, by British naval expert Hector C. Bywater, predicted that in a war Guam “would doubtless be the first Japanese objective.” He also predicted a Japanese surprise attack on the American Pacific fleet in a prophetic book in 1925, The Great Pa- cific War. Bywater influenced U.S. naval strategists</p>
                <p>137</p>
                <p>to alter War Plan Orange in 1926 and may also have inspired Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (the Japa- nese naval attaché in Washington, D.C., in the late 1920s) to plan the Pearl Harbor attack that even- tually took place in 1941. The Yap crisis faded in the early 1920s, when the United States settled into “normalcy,” as the new U.S. president, Warren G. Harding, a Republican who died in office in 1923, described the postwar era. Bywater’s prophecies were forgotten by everyone—except the Japanese.</p>
                <p>Japanese control of Micronesia became solidi- fied when the U.S. Senate subsequently refused to ratify the Versailles treaty, thereby keeping the United States out of the League of Nations. In the end, the United States emerged as a loser in the post- war settlement in the Pacific, to the dismay of the U.S. Navy. To forestall a naval arms race in which Japan might emerge dominant in Asia, the Hard- ing administration convened an international big- power conference that met in Washington, D.C., in 1921-1922.</p>
                <p>The landmark Washington conference created a system to limit naval arms through a series of mul- tilateral treaties, one of which—the Five-Power Naval Treaty—set limits on the numbers and ton- nage of battleships and aircraft carriers that could be constructed by the major naval powers. Further- more, the United States agreed not to fortify any of its Pacific islands west of Hawai‘i for ten years, at which time the treaty was to be renegotiated. In return, the old Anglo-Japanese alliance was abro- gated. Ratification of the treaties by the U.S. Senate put a halt—again to the dismay of the U.S. Navy— to any fortification of Guam, including military airfields. A geopolitical calm then settled over the western Pacific for the next ten years.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Navy nonetheless continued the secret game of intelligence gathering. In order to obtain more reliable reports than those of Atkins, Kroll and civilian travelers in the Pacific, the U.S. Marine Corps sent Pete Ellis, now a lieutenant colonel, back to the region. Ellis traveled as a “copra trader” in Japan and throughout Micronesia, bouncing in and out of hospitals as a result of drinking bouts between spying efforts. He died on Palau in 1923</p>
                <p>138</p>
                <p>in an alcoholic haze. His mission was never clear and in the end was mostly futile. He found that the Japanese as of the early 1920s were not fortifying Micronesia as the U.S. Navy thought.</p>
                <p>While on his strange last journey, Ellis was in contact with another ONI source, none other than Hans Hornbostel. Ellis’ former assistant had been commissioned a marine lieutenant in the war and afterwards he and Gertrude worked as archaeologi- cal-naturalist field investigators for the Bishop Mu- seum of Honolulu. In this work, Hans traveled sev- eral times to the Marianas between 1924 and 1926. He also secretly provided information to the ONI on Japanese economic and political activities.</p>
                <p>The Japanese grew suspicious of American visi- tors to Micronesia, so ONI switched its main sur- veillance to radio intercepts. In 1920, two new radio towers 600 feet high were erected at Libugon Hill on Guam. By 1929, intercepts of Japanese open and coded radio signals were under way. In that year, the navy moved a small cryptological team from Shang- hai to Libugon. By 1935, U.S. intelligence services were breaking the Japanese military Red Code as well as the diplomatic Purple Code.</p>
                <p>In internal Guam affairs, the navy in 1922 reorga- nized the Guam public school system and patterned the courses of study after the California system. Coeducation was instituted because of the shortage of classrooms, and the navy continued to prescribe a detailed, rigid curriculum and all textbooks. In- structions to teachers in 1922 stated, “No teacher or principal is permitted to deviate from this course of study.” Steps were taken against use of the Cha- morro language in schoolrooms and on school grounds. In an incredible action, naval authorities had Chamorro-English dictionaries collected and the books burned.</p>
                <p>In March 1922, the last issue of the Guam News Letter appeared. The publication ended “on ac- count of economic reasons.” It was replaced in March 1924 by a new monthly, the Guam Recorder, which was privately owned by William W. Row- ley, a former sailor on the Yosemite. Editor of the new monthly for years was Lieutenant Commander</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>P. J. Searles. Associate editors were Hans Hornbostel and William G. Johnston. Searles was the mainstay of the Guam Recorder before World War II, writing numerous articles and the first history in English of Guam, which unfortunately was never published as a book.</p>
                <p>By 1923, a golf course, the Sumay Golf Links, with eighteen holes was in place, and the Guam Golf Club was organized. By this period, America’s favorite soft drink, Coca-Cola, was being sold on Guam by the Agana Bottling Works, owned by C.C. Butler and family. The year 1924 saw the es- tablishment of the Guam Chamber of Commerce, which concentrated on promoting copra and agri- cultural production. Also active on Guam by then were B.P.O. Elk’s Lodge 1281, established in 1914, and Charleston Lodge 44 of the Free and Accepted Masons, established in 1918 under the authority of the Grand Lodge in Manila. Agana and Sumay, but not the rural villages, were becoming more Ameri- canized every year.</p>
                <p>One event reported in the Guam Recorder was the establishment of a local holiday to commemo- rate Magellan’s landing on its 400th anniversary. Chamorros had assumed through oral tradition that, since the Spanish galleons had normally halted at Umatac, Magellan must also have landed there. Funds were collected by public donations, and on March 6, 1926, an obelisk was unveiled near the beach at Umatac. A plaque on the monument, which still stands, reads, “Magellan landed near here.”</p>
                <p>Thereafter, March 6 was celebrated annually on Guam until World War II as Magellan Day. It was revived as Discovery Day in 1971, complete with a lively village fiesta in Umatac and a reenactment of Magellan’s landing. Research by the author of this book and colleagues in the 1980s concluded that Magellan probably landed at either Tumon or Aga- na and that he came ashore on March 7, not March 6. Nonetheless, the Umatac landing is still celebrat- ed each year, commemorating, in the words of a Chamorro historian, “the association of the village of Umatac with an icon of historical significance.” In 1996 the name of the holiday was changed to Discovery Day/Chief Hurao Day to honor the Cha-</p>

                <p>morro leader who led the resistance to the Span- iards in the 1670s.</p>
                <p>In the 1920s, increasing numbers of high-ranking American federal officials and congressmen started visiting Guam by army transports on official junkets to the Philippines and Asia. Secretary of the Navy Charles Denby initiated the junkets in August 1923, and in July 1925 eleven members of the U.S. House of Representatives spent three days on the island. The U.S. congressmen attended a session of the Guam Congress, where Chamorros took the oppor- tunity to ask politely for U.S. citizenship. The years 1926, 1927, and 1928 saw over two dozen more American congressional visitors stop on Guam. Sev- eral of these visitors promised to submit bills in the U.S. Congress to give American citizenship to the people of Guam.</p>
                <p>The Guam Congress was aroused by a different issue in September 1926, when a resolution was introduced in the Philippine House of Represen- tatives to request the United States to cede Guam to the Philippines. The Guam Chamber of Com- merce called it “ridiculous.” In October 1926, the Guam Congress adopted a resolution that not only rejected the Filipino initiative but again asked for “full” U.S. citizenship. Nothing came of the Fili- pino resolution.</p>
                <p>The Chamorro request for American citizen- ship, for its part, was taken up when a bill was in- troduced in 1927 in the Sixty-Ninth Congress by two U.S. congressmen who had been on the 1925 visit to Guam. The bill was submitted in the con- text of efforts in 1926 and 1927 to grant American citizenship to the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Although acquired for defense purposes and under navy administration from 1917 to 1931, the Virgin Islands never assumed strategic military importance. Navy officials therefore endorsed U.S. citizenship for the Virgin Islanders. The Guam bill died owing to navy opposition, while citizenship for the Virgin Islanders was granted by the U.S. Congress in 1927.</p>
                <p>In 1927, Chamorros heard rumors that the U.S. Department of the Interior might take over admin- istration of Guam and the Philippines. Chamorros knew that Interior had a reputation of treating na-</p>

                <p>tive American Indians shabbily and that it received less money from the U.S. Congress for its wards than did the navy. Alarmed, the Guam Congress swiftly adopted a resolution, stating, “The people of Guam are perfectly satisfied with the present form of Government.” The navy used this and similar statements by Guam Congress members to block the Chamorros when they later asked for more po- litical rights. The switch of island administration to Interior died, for the time being.</p>

                <p>It was not until June 1929 that political conditions on Guam significantly changed when Commander Willis W. Bradley, Jr, replaced Captain Lloyd S. Shapley as governor. Bradley considered himself to be a “Progressive Republican” and a civil libertar- ian, a combination that made him more liberal than any other American naval governor on Guam. First in his class at Annapolis, he had won the Congres- sional Medal of Honor in World War I. Moreover, he knew the island well, having been in command in 1924-1926 of the USS Gold Star, known as the “Goldie Maru,” a 4,500-ton cargo-passenger car- rier, which was Guam’s station ship from September 1924 until World War II.</p>
                <p>Bradley immediately used the 1929 Annual Re- port (which covered the last year of the previous governor) to recommend that U.S. citizenship be granted Chamorros by federal legislation. This proposal was endorsed by a surprised Guam Con- gress in a resolution in December 1929. The Guam Chamber of Commerce “emphatically” concurred. Pending federal action, Bradley issued a proclama- tion in March 1930 that established “Guam citizen- ship” for all residents and set up procedures for the naturalization of resident aliens as Guam citizens.</p>
                <p>Then Bradley recommended to Washington that a bill of rights be granted Guam citizens in order to protect the islanders from arbitrary decrees of naval governors. When Washington failed to respond for several months, Bradley went ahead and proclaimed the Guam Bill of Rights in December 1930. There were twelve provisions in the bill, including for the</p>

                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>Governor Willis W. Bradley, Jr., signing Bill of Rights, 1930. Beside him sits Monsignor Felipe Joaquin M. Olaiz y Zabalza, a Basque Capuchin and bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Guam from 1915 to 1936. The signing was in the garden of the governor’s residence enclosed by old Spanish fence pillars (in background). (From the collection of the</p>

                <p>first time the right of writ of habeas corpus and the privilege of voting in local elections regardless of race or sex. In January 1931, the islanders held a large parade that ended in a public demonstration in the Plaza de Espafia to thank Bradley. Former ma- rine James Underwood, as the postmaster of Guam and the president of the Chamber of Commerce, led the speeches of appreciation.</p>
                <p>The energetic Bradley followed up these startling measures with an even more dramatic reform, the reconstitution of the Guam Congress. By the time that Bradley arrived on Guam, the First Guam Con- gress was, in his words, “not functioning either as</p>
                <p>a representative body or in a manner to take full advantage of its possibilities.” He accordingly dis- solved the old congress in March 1931 and issued another proclamation that established the Second Guam Congress. This body consisted of two hous- es: a House of Assembly, with twenty-seven mem- bers elected for two-year terms, and the House of Council, with fifteen members elected for four-year terms. The first election to the new congress was held in March 1931, and Bradley opened the first session in April.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the Great Depression was in full swing in the early 1930s. The navy, squeezed by</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>congressional budget cuts, was not happy with Bradley’s efforts and threatened to remove him in 1930. Bradley replied, “When I see and understand the crying needs of Guam I shall fight for them as long as I am governor, even if it wrecks my future naval life.”</p>
                <p>The navy backed down temporarily, but less than a year later in April 1931 Bradley was recalled. The Guam Congress passed a resolution in praise of his “brilliant and vigorous” administration. Another resolution asked the secretary of the navy to per- mit Bradley to act as “an agent to represent them in the United States.” This appeal was ignored, and Bradley was replaced by Captain Edmund S. Root in May 1931. Bradley was subsequently passed over by the navy for promotion to captain, but World War II revived his career. He retired as a captain</p>

Of all U.S. naval governors of Guam, Bradley, who served from June 1929 to May 1931, was the most helpful to the island’s people. In addition to issuing Guam’s first Bill of Rights, he sought U.S. citizenship for Chamorros, pro- claimed them to be citizens of Guam, and reor- ganized the Guam Congress. (Painting by Robert H. Clark; courtesy of Anne Bradley Brucker)</p>
                <p>in 1946 and went on to serve in the U.S. Congress from 1948 to 1950.</p>
                <p>While Bradley left Guam in 1931 much more politi- cized than when he arrived, external events in the late 1920s and early 1930s had a deeper impact on Guam’s future. Plan Orange had been revised by the U.S. Navy in 1927-1928, and for the first time it assumed that Guam would fall in a war with Japan. In 1928, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet steamed to Guam for a mock invasion exercise. The fleet admiral found Apra Harbor too small for his ships and of “no value as a haven for vessels of war.” In a some- what feeble measure to prevent foreign surveillance, President Herbert C. Hoover in 1930 declared the airspace of Guam as well as of Pearl Harbor, Guan- tanamo, and Subic Bay prohibited to civil aircraft.</p>
                <p>142</p>
                <p>In accord with international treaties and budget cuts caused by the Depression in the early 1930s, the U.S. Marine Corps seaplane squadron on Guam was withdrawn to San Diego in 1931, and all ma- jor ordnance pieces on the island were dismantled in 1932 even though conferences in Geneva in 1927 and in London in 1930 had failed to control the arms race. In 1935, the arms reduction system collapsed at another London conference. The same year, Japan formally embarked on the creation of the “Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere,” a new regional order under Japan’s control against Western colonialism.</p>
                <p>By then Japan’s government was dominated by militarists bent on expansion in the spirit of bushido, the traditional code of honor and courage for samurai warriors of old for whom surrender was the ultimate dishonor. Ominously, the Japanese Im- perial Navy staged war maneuvers within sight of Guam and undertook surveys to construct military airfields, naval bases, and fortifications throughout Japanese Micronesia.</p>
                <p>The United States in the meanwhile had elected a Democrat—Franklin Delano Roosevelt—as presi- dent in 1932. His platform of New Deal social and welfare programs to combat the Depression was welcomed by the new generation of Chamor- ro leaders who had grown up under American rule on Guam. These new Chamorro leaders included attorney Francisco Baza (Kiko Zoilo, also called “F.B.”) Leon Guerrero and businessmen Eduardo T. Calvo and Baltazar Jeronimo (called “B. J.”) Bor- dallo. They were all members of the Second Guam Congress. The Second Guam Congress, like the First Congress, was purely advisory, and the gov- ernors after Bradley largely rejected its resolutions. As a consequence, public interest once more fell off, and at the second election in 1933 twelve seats were vacant for lack of candidates. The governors there- after regularly appointed members to the vacant seats.</p>
                <p>In this depressing political climate, Chamorro leaders tried once more to obtain American citizen- ship. In the January 1933 issue of the Guam Record- er, Congressmen Manuel F. Ulloa and Dr. Ramon</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>M. Sablan made another appeal for U.S. citizenship, and the same issue printed a letter from Guam Post- master James Underwood to a U.S. senator with yet another appeal. Encouragement came from Presi- dent Roosevelt himself, according to a Chamorro who visited with the president in 1933 on a trip to the mainland. When the leaders on Guam learned of this encouragement, they organized a drive for another petition for citizenship. In December 1933, the petition with nearly 2,000 signatures was en- dorsed by Governor George A. Alexander and sent to the White House and various federal officials.</p>
                <p>In Washington, the petition was referred as a bill to the Senate Committee on Immigration of the Sev- enty-third Congress by Senator Ernest W. Gibson, Republican of Vermont. Gibson had been a visitor to Guam a few years earlier, and this conscientious New Englander took up the cause of the Chamorros out of sympathy with their plight. The secretary of the navy immediately opposed any bill based on the petition because, he wrote, Chamorros “are Orien- tals.” President Roosevelt concurred, according to navy files, and the petition was filed and forgotten.</p>
                <p>The Depression in the meantime had smothered economic activity on Guam. Copra exports declined and prices fell disastrously. Another victim of the Depression was the Guam Recorder, which Rowley had to sell in 1933. The buyer was none other than the U.S. Navy, which had not been happy with some of the monthly’s editorials. The quality of the ar- ticles in the Guam Recorder remained high under the navy. These included contributions of historical and other nonfiction pieces by writers such as the Hornbostels and excellent translations by Margaret L. Higgins of the history of Father San Vitores by the Spanish Jesuit historian Garcia.</p>
                <p>In this period, a daily newspaper appeared in mimeographed format, named the Guam Eagle in allusion to the great brown flying cockroaches on the island. The navy edited and distributed the paper, as it did the monthly Guam Recorder. Both publications would fall victims to World War II. The mid-1930s also saw for a few years Guam’s first commercial radio, K6LG, owned by C.C. But- ler’s company.</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>A significant governmental change took place in December 1933, when Guam’s judicial system was reorganized by Governor George A. Alexander. He abrogated previous laws and established new codes based on California codes. The last of the old Span- ish laws, mostly to do with property matters, were eliminated or absorbed into the new codes. None- theless, as under the old codes set up by Governor Sewell in 1903, none of the justices on the Court of Appeals—the highest court in the system—had to be an attorney or otherwise qualified in law. The new codes still were a confusing mix of U.S. Navy and California procedures and laws.</p>
                <p>Education on Guam was retarded by the Depres- sion. Chamorro children in public schools num- bered around 4,000 islandwide by the mid-1930s, but funds limited the number of teachers to 175, or a ratio of twenty-two students to one teacher. Navy policy had long been to provide schooling only to the sixth grade for Chamorros outside Agana. Local teacher leader Agueda Johnston and others had to fight for the expansion of the education of village children through the high school level. Moreover, a large number of Chamorro children, predominantly girls, were still unable to attend school because of the shortage of classrooms.</p>
                <p>Many Chamorro teachers could still barely speak or write English and were not certified by U.S. stan- dards. In contrast, the navy had been operating two elite schools on Guam since 1929, one in Agana and one at Sumay, for American children only, mostly military dependents. These two schools, with thirty students and six American teachers, had a student- to-teacher ratio of only five to one and charged a nominal tuition.</p>
                <p>The end of the Depression brought one major commercial improvement and one minor social ben- efit to Guam. The minor benefit was the ending of Prohibition in June 1934. The major improvement was the advent of civil aviation. In 1935, the dy- namic Juan T. Trippe, president of Pan American Airways, initiated regular trans-Pacific airmail ser- vice from San Francisco to Manila and back with a huge new seaplane, the Martin 130, named the</p>
                <p>China Clipper.</p>
                <p>143</p>
                <p>On Guam, Pan American seaplanes landed in Apra Harbor in a channel marked by lighted buoys. Shore facilities were built at Sumay on leased property of the former seaplane base. In 1936, Pan American constructed a twenty-room hotel, the Skyways Inn, at Sumay, and, on October 14, 1936, the inaugural passenger flight landed in Apra Harbor. Those aboard were mostly newsmen on a free junket to provide publicity. Among them was Thomas H. Beck, the influential head of Crowell, Collier, and Macmillan publishers, who would lat- er be of great help to Chamorros in their quest for U.S. citizenship. Regular flights with a crew of four or five and about fifteen passengers on the average took six days to cross the Pacific from San Francisco to Manila with overnight stops in Honolulu, Mid- way, Wake, and Guam.</p>
                <p>By 1937, Chamorros were traveling on Pan American flights, and Governor James T. Alexander reported postal receipts on Guam had trebled as a result of airmail service. Pan American added two more Martin 130s, called the Hawaii Clipper and the Manila Clipper, and extended passenger and cargo routes to Macao, Hong Kong, and Shanghai with weekly trans-Pacific flights out of San Fran- cisco. The Pan American clippers made Guam the “Hub of the Pacific,” according to publicity releas- es, with celebrities such as former world champion boxer Jack Dempsey and novelist Ernest Heming- way stopping for the one-night layover on Guam. Dempsey refereed a boxing match, and Hemingway went fishing for marlin.</p>
                <p>The Hawaii Clipper disappeared mysteriously in March 1938 on the Guam-to-Manila leg. A two-week ocean search by the Guam station pa- trol ship, the USS Penguin (which had replaced the Piscataqua in 1929), failed to find any trace of the aircraft, crew, or passengers. A hijacking or sabo- tage by Japanese saboteurs was conjectured (Japan suspected that Pan American was spying for the ONI on flights near Rota and perhaps Palau), but the plane most likely went down in a storm or as a result of systems failure. In 1939, Pan American added a new and bigger flying boat to their routes, the Boeing 18, each of forty-one tons with a 152-</p>

The Pan American clippers made Guam the “Hub of the Pacific,” according to Pan American publicists, until World War II ended the flights. (From the collection of the</p>

                <p>foot wingspan. The romantic Pan American clipper service would end, as did so many other things with the special style of the 1930s, with World War II.</p>
                <p>The Depression years brought about sharp changes in American relations with the Philippines, which in turn affected Guam. Philippine products, which were duty free in the United States, and Filipino im- migrants, who worked for low wages, were now seen as unfair competition by depressed U.S. busi- nesses and labor. With the rise of a militaristic im- perial Japan, it was also becoming apparent that the United States might not be able to defend the Philippines in a Pacific war. Conservative American businessmen and military strategists joined in an odd coupling with liberal advocates of Filipino self- determination to “free” the Philippines. As a con- sequence, and pushed by the desire of Filipinos for</p>
                <p>independence, authorities in Washington decided on a divorce from Manila.</p>
                <p>In 1934, President Roosevelt signed the Tydings- McDuffie Act, which made the Philippines a lo- cally self-governing commonwealth for a ten-year period, after which it would be independent and American military bases there would be withdrawn. The Tydings-McDuffie Act alarmed Guam’s lead- ers, who still feared Guam might be ceded to the Phillippines. When U.S. Secretary of War George H. Dorn stopped on Guam in late 1935, B.J. Bordallo, president of the House of Council of the Second Guam Congress, asked him to deliver another ap- peal to the U.S. president to clarify the civil status of Guam’s people. Again, no action was taken by anyone in Washington.</p>
                <p>In July 1936, the Second Guam Congress once more adopted a resolution that requested the U.S.</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>Congress to grant American citizenship to Guam’s people. This time the Guamanians planned to send two delegates—B.J.Bordallo and F.B.Leon Guer- rero—to Washington to deliver the petition per- sonally and to lobby for a bill to implement it. The Chamorros asked the governor, Captain Benjamin W. McCandlish, to match local donations with offi- cial funds to help pay for the expensive 16,000-mile trip, estimated to cost around $10,000. The gover- nor refused the request with the excuse that official financial support of lobbyists for U.S. citizenship would be a breach of faith between the naval gov- ernment and the federal government.</p>
                <p>Undaunted, the Chamorros then launched a fund- raising campaign, and with the nickels and dimes of schoolchildren as well as the dollars of their par- ents, money was gathered. It was not enough, so Bordallo and Leon Guerrero made up the difference with their own funds. In November 1936, they em- barked on the Gold Star for Japan. From there they took the Matson liner President Lincoln for San Francisco and traveled by train to Washington.</p>
                <p>In Washington, the two men were taken under the wing of publisher Thomas Beck, who had stopped on Guam on Pan American flights and had empa- thy with the Chamorros. Consequently, the Cha- morro delegates received good U.S. media coverage. The men also enlisted the help of Senator Gibson in drafting a bill for submission to the Seventy-fifth U.S. Congress to give American citizenship to the Chamorros of Guam. In February 1937, Gibson and Senator Millard E. Tydings introduced the bill, S. 1450. Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland and chair of the Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs, had drafted the Philippines commonwealth legislation. A companion Guam bill was submitted to the House of Representatives. Hearings in the Senate followed, and the two Chamorros and their sponsors immediately ran into a high, hard wall erected by the U.S. Navy.</p>
                <p>In a straightforward colonialist statement, Secre- tary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson wrote to the Senate committee: “...these people [the Chamor- ros] have not yet reached a state of development commensurate with the personal independence,</p>
                <p>145</p>
                <p>obligations, and responsibilities of United States citizenship.... The Navy recommends against the enactment of Bill 1450.”</p>
                <p>In their testimony, the two Chamorro delegates refuted the navy’s points and criticized naval rule of Guam as “without any justification.” They noted that Puerto Rico’s people had been granted Ameri- can citizenship in 1917 and that residents of the Vir- gin Islands were granted citizenship in 1927.</p>
                <p>The navy trumped the Chamorros’ testimony by asking for a closed session with the committee to discuss classified information without the pres- ence of Bordallo and Leon Guerrero. Behind closed doors, the navy presented national defense consid- erations based on the secret Orange Plans, of which the Chamorros were unaware. Navy officials also cited earlier resolutions by the Guam congresses and statements by Chamorros of how satisfied they were with navy government. The Department of State opposed the bill largely because it might pro- voke the Japanese, who were already suspicious of American purposes in Guam. By the final hearing, it was clear the bill might not pass. Bordallo and Leon Guerrero then obtained, with Beck’s help, a meeting with President Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>In the Oval Office, Roosevelt asked them, “Are the Navy people treating you right on Guam?” Im- mediately both delegates respectfully replied, “Oh yes!” They apparently assumed that the president was asking about personal treatment of Chamorros by navy personnel (which was generally friendly), not about general political treatment (which was au- thoritarian). Their reply also reflected the custom- ary tendency of Pacific islanders to avoid confron- tations in a personal exchange and to be respectful (tabdong in Chamorro) of persons in authority. The meeting turned to the presentation of gifts, and the president chatted about deep-sea fishing until the meeting ended. The two delegates, by being so discreet, lost a once-only opportunity to argue the Chamorro case energetically to the president.</p>
                <p>Short on money, Bordallo returned to Guam, flying between Honolulu and Guam on the China Clipper after writing a long report with recom- mendations to the Second Guam Congress. In his</p>
                <p>146</p>
                <p>comments on the report, Governor McCandlish criticized Bordallo “because many of his statements were incorrect and many of his recommendations are in my judgement imprudent.” McCandlish re- flected the unchanging navy argument that the Cha- morros needed more time, in his words, “to develop the intelligence and managing ability for progress,” before they could undertake the self-government that American citizenship would entail. He, like most naval officers, linked political rights to eco- nomic progress; that is, the Chamorros did not merit political rights because, he said, they “do not work hard to improve their economic conditions.” The U.S. Congress agreed with the navy view, and no action was taken on the citizenship bill for Guam’s people. Tydings and Gibson resubmitted the bill in the Seventy-sixth Congress in August 1939, but by then official Washington was focused on the threat of world war, and Guam’s appeal once more died. Subsequently, Guam’s leaders obtained the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to attain rights for Chamorros, but nothing was ac- complished before World War II suspended Guam’s quest for citizenship. In the meantime, Leon Guer- rero had remained in Washington and was low on money. He had to borrow against his land for cash. When he returned to Guam and was unable to re- pay all his travel debts, he lost some of the land.</p>
                <p>End of an Era</p>
                <p>While Guam’s drive for American citizenship was dying in Washington, the “international situation,” as Secretary of the Navy Swanson asserted, was de- teriorating rapidly. At the end of 1936, Japan abro- gated its obligations under all existing arms treaties and sealed off most of its Micronesian mandate to outsiders. The military-dominated government in Tokyo began construction of large-scale military fortifications and bases on its islands throughout Micronesia. Diplomatic maneuvering and its shad- ow, spying, heated up in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>By the mid-1930s, a Japanese intelligence system was operating among patriotic Japanese nationals resident on Guam, including nisei (second-genera-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>tion Japanese immigrants, that is, those born outside Japan). Needing imports to Guam, the U.S. Navy for years had given permits to Japanese-owned com- mercial vessels with Japanese captains and crews to trade in and out of Apra Harbor. Japanese loyalists on Guam included Samuel Takekuma Shinohara, owner of the Rooster Bar, Agana’s only restaurant, and president of the Japanese Society of Guam; Je- sus Sayama, a merchant; and Mrs. Nao Kaneaki Sawada, widow of a Japanese businessman. By the late 1930s, these Japanese patriots and others were under surveillance by the Guam police for the ONI as possible informants working for Japanese intel- ligence agencies.</p>
                <p>To assess whether Guam should be fortified as a defensive base with new airfields and naval facilities in the threatening new strategic situation, a board of naval officers under Rear Admiral Arthur J. Hep- burn was formed in May 1938. Like the early Or- ange Plans, the Hepburn report recommended that Guam be developed “as a major air and submarine base...and a fully equipped fleet base at a cost of $200 million.” The Navy General Board, however, rejected large-scale fortification and narrowed the recommendations to harbor improvements, includ- ing once again the proposal to build a breakwater at Apra.</p>
                <p>The Hepburn report was too late. Republican Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York objected that any military bases on Guam would constitute “a dagger at the throat of Japan.” The Department of State wavered before also opposing the board’s recommendations. Once more Congress did not au- thorize money for the fortification of Guam or even for the breakwater. The only action taken was that Guam was closed in 1938 to all vessels of foreign registry, isolating the island even further.</p>
                <p>Events in Europe took center stage in Washing- ton’s eyes when World War II erupted in 1939 with Germany’s invasion of Poland. The American high command decided to make campaigns in the Atlan- tic and in Europe against Nazi Germany the number one priority, with war in the Pacific secondary. New U.S. global strategic plans, called Rainbow War Plans, were drawn up in late 1939 and early 1940</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>to replace all previous U.S. strategic plans. Under Rainbow War Plan Five (which assumed war in Asia and in Europe and a U.S.-U.K. alliance), the navy placed Guam in Category F, the lowest defense cat- egory, as a U.S. territory that could not be defended.</p>
                <p>As part of its preparations for war, the United States stepped up its efforts to decode Japanese en- crypted communications after Japan joined the Axis Pact with Germany and Italy in September 1940. The cover name for the collection and analysis of Japanese signal intelligence was Operation Magic. The naval communication facilities on Guam played a valuable role in Operation Magic until December 1941. The Americans, however, never fully broke the JN-25 upgraded Japanese code after 1940. This code, called ULTRA by the Americans, contained Japanese naval plans to assault Pearl Harbor and Guam in surprise attacks.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in retaliation for Japanese aggression in China, the United States and Britain imposed a trade embargo against Japan in July 1940 on avia- tion gasoline and strategic metals. In February 1941, President Roosevelt declared Guam to be a “defen- sive sea area and airspace reservation” off-limits to all foreign and U.S. sea and air commercial carriers without permission of the U.S. Navy. Because mili- tary needs took priorities over civil needs even after the war ended, Guam would remain a closed port to all normal commerce for the next twenty-two years until 1962, crippling development of the island for seventeen long years after 1945.</p>
                <p>A final drastic worsening of Japanese-American relations came in July 1941, when Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets in the United States in retaliation for Japanese aggression in French Indochina. The Japanese promptly retaliated by freezing American assets in Japan. From then on war between the two nations was inevitable.</p>
                <p>On the eve of America’s entry into World War II, social conditions on Guam were substantially dif- ferent, and better in many respects from the navy’s point of view, than they had been four decades ear- lier when Captain Glass steamed into Apra Harbor. Acculturation of the Chamorros into the American</p>
                <p>147</p>
                <p>ethos was already deeper than their absorption into the Spanish culture in all social aspects except reli- gion. The use of English on Guam was more wide- spread than had been the use of Spanish, and accep- tance of the American lifestyle by Chamorros was already pronounced.</p>
                <p>The 1940 census showed a total of 23,067 people on the island. Military personnel and dependents numbered 778, “Non-Native” residents (over half of whom were part Chamorro) numbered 787, and “Natives” 21,502. The local population had in- creased by 128 percent over the 9,630 recorded in 1901, an average of 3.2 percent per year, far high- er than under Spanish rule. For years, officials of the U.S. Navy had been self-congratulatory about their accomplishments on Guam. The Aznual Re- ports were full of compliments of governors to their predecessors and to themselves. Back in 1928, Sec- retary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur wrote, “Dur- ing the period of Naval administration the popula- tion of Guam has doubled and the government has produced a happy, contented and patriotic peo- ple.... The needs and desires of the people of Guam, it is believed, are fully and sympathetically cared for by the present arrangement.”</p>
                <p>Beneath this assumption of benevolent progress by the navy, however, the reality of life by 1941 for ordinary Chamorros contradicted the official view. The island still had a subsistence economy; the port remained closed to normal commerce; de facto ra- cial segregation between Chamorros and Americans still existed; and an unfavorable trade balance per- sisted, just as under the Spaniards. Rats and packs of boonie dogs still happily roamed the island out- side the military facilities, just as in Spanish times. Health standards were still low, and the government was still one of authoritarian military colonialism.</p>
                <p>Navy efforts over the years to stimulate island agricultural production and to foster local industry were only marginally successful. Although unem- ployment was low, the majority of the population now depended on government support in some way. In a confidential intelligence assessment in June 1942, the Office of Strategic Services (the OSS, pre- decessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA)</p>
                <p>148</p>
                <p>characterized prewar Guam as an island “with a ba- sic tropical agricultural economy thrown seriously out of gear by the presence of the United States Na- val Station...and by Naval Station work projects which have set wage standards out of proportion to return for labor in agricultural occupations.”</p>
                <p>The navy had brought electricity and many oth- er amenities to Guam, but by late 1941 roads still amounted to only a meager eighty-five miles, all of crushed limestone cascajo except for the Sumay to Agana section, which was the island’s first asphalt road. Improvements in island infrastructure were related mostly to naval needs. There was still no road covering the eighty miles around the island.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the Americans had been gradually tak- ing land away from the Chamorros. Land taking by the Americans on Guam, primarily for military purposes, was a root cause of Chamorro dissatis- faction with American government before and after World War II, and this dissatisfaction remains to- day. By 1941, the two American governmental enti- ties on Guam, the federal and the naval (the distinc- tion was inconsequential to the Chamorros), owned over one-third of the island. This was an increase of over 30 percent since 1899, and much of the expan- sion was at the expense of the Chamorros the naval government was supposedly protecting from exploi- tation. In the meantime, defense needs for land on Guam had actually shrunk in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
                <p>The lack of economic progress, however, had not inhibited the growth of the island’s government. The executive branch—in1941 still under the abso- lute authority of the governor—included fifteen mu- nicipalities, each with an appointed commissioner and all under a chief commissioner in Agana since 1931. The Marine Corps Insular Patrol rather than civil police still operated in each village. Chamorros still had no right to legal protection by grand jury, there were still no trials by jury or appeals to fed- eral courts off-island, and all judges and attorneys served at the will of the governor. A comprehensive printing of Guam’s laws was issued in 1937 as The Codes of Guam, but this compilation was soon in- complete because the navy never had a regular com- piler of laws.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>In religious matters, the U.S. Navy was still not comfortable with the Catholic Church on Guam. Monsignor Olaiz was replaced in 1936 as titu- lar bishop and apostolic vicar of Guam by Father Miguel Angel de Olano y Urteaga, a Spanish Capu- chin, who had long been the parish priest at Sumay. The Capuchins on Guam, all conservative Basques, opposed practices introduced by the Americans. Worst of all in the American view, the Spanish priests helped perpetuate the Chamorro language in their sermons and writings. In particular, Father Roman Maria de Vera, who had received a medal from President Wilson for dedicated service in the 1918 influenza epidemic, helped preserve the Cha- morro language in church rituals and daily life. A linguist, Father Roman served from 1915 to 1941 on Guam and was a prolific writer of Chamorro- Spanish dictionaries, grammar texts, and hymnals, none of which were under navy purview.</p>
                <p>As a result, the navy began to replace the Span- ish Capuchins, to the latters’ dismay, with American Capuchins in 1937. In 1939, the Guam diocese was placed under a Capuchin order based in Detroit. By December 1941, of the fourteen priests on Guam, ten were Americans, two were Chamorros—Father Jesus Baza Duenas (ordained in 1938) and Father Oscar Lujan (Pale‘ Scot) Calvo (ordained in 1941)— and two were Spaniards. These fourteen men served nineteen churches and over 22,000 Catholics.</p>
                <p>The Baptists on Guam had also grown in numbers under the leadership of a Chamorro lay preacher, José Aguon Flores, during 1930-1935. After that, they were led by Reverend Joaquin Flores Sablan, the first General Baptist minister of Chamorro de- scent. There were two Baptist churches on Guam in the late 1930s with approximately 400 members. Reverend Sablan, who was rector of the Agana Gen- eral Baptist Mission Church, would also become one of Guam’s most prominent educators.</p>
                <p>Education remained inadequate and an issue of contention on Guam right up to the war. The school system by late 1941 comprised twenty-four pub- lic primary schools, one private school (the Guam Institute), and George Washington High School. Chamorro children in school numbered a little over</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>5,000 out of over 7,500 school-age children, or only 60 percent, and were taught only by Chamorros. All six American contract teachers on the island by 1941 taught in the two exclusive American schools.</p>
                <p>A local board of education had finally been estab- lished in 1938, but it was only advisory to the gov- ernor and had no authority over personnel or the curriculum. An informed commentator would later write of the public schools, “Not a single textbook adapted to the local customs and every day experi- ences of the Guamanian child had been developed.” The Catholic Church, however, had prepared a number of such books, mostly by Father Roman, for their private schools on Guam, including some in the Chamorro language.</p>
                <p>Use of the Chamorro language in public schools was still forbidden as of 1941. The 1940 census re- ported nearly 75 percent of all persons on Guam over age ten spoke English, yet Chamorro remained the main language in nongovernmental life despite four decades of American efforts to suppress it. The navy viewed Chamorro insistence on speaking the indigenous language as a cognitive deficiency on the part of the islanders.</p>
                <p>Navy expenditures for education per pupil on Guam in 1934 were $16.09 and by 1941 had dropped to $14.10, lower than the poorest U.S. state. Illiteracy among Chamorros was actually in- creasing in 1940-1941 to nearly 17 percent over age ten. Despite the low wages of Chamorro teach- ers ($0.80 a day at entry versus $1.00 a day for la- borers in navy jobs), their prestige was high, and many, such as Nieves M. Flores (owner of the Guam Institute private school), Superintendent Simon A. Sanchez, and Agueda Johnston (principal of the ju- nior and senior high schools), were leaders in civic affairs.</p>
                <p>One knowledgeable person who was critical of the prewar Guam school system was Laura M. Thompson, an American cultural anthropologist. In 1938-1939, she did ethnographic field research on the island as a consultant for the naval govern- ment. That fieldwork, mostly in Merizo, resulted in several scholarly articles and an outstanding book, Guam and Its People. Her book, published in 1941</p>
                <p>149</p>
                <p>and reprinted after the war, was the most compre- hensive analysis of neo-Chamorro culture since Louis de Freycinet’s research in 1819.</p>
                <p>In contrast to education and democratization, the American navy’s record in public health on Guam was considerably better. The death rate fell from 27.8 per 1,000 persons in 1905 to 11.7 in 1940. Gangosa and Hansen’s disease were all but elimi- nated on the island, even though lytico-bodig per- sisted. Overall, Guam’s population in 1941 in com- parison with 1899 was more multiethnic, was better educated, enjoyed higher living standards, and was much healthier than when the Americans arrived.</p>
                <p>One difference since Spanish times was that Americanization and education had sown the seeds of social discontent to a more profound extent among Chamorros in regard to political liberties, which had improved little since 1899. Chamorros resented most of all the pervasive racial discrimina- tion practiced in the naval system under the mantle of American rhetoric about equality and liberty for all. Americans were less class conscious but more racist than the Spaniards had been.</p>
                <p>Over the sweep of Guam’s long history, American government of the island for the forty years prior to World War II can be judged to have been as much of a failure as that of the Spaniards, who made no pretense of trying to improve political and eco- nomic conditions on the island. Laura Thompson made the following judgment of the difference be- tween the Spaniards and the Americans: “The Span- ish Catholic regime, although involving great initial loss of physical life...introduced new channels of native self-expression and spiritual growth....The American naval regime, on the other hand, while fostering population increase and physical develop- ment...suppressed many channels of native self- expression and creativity, apparently without pro- viding adequate substitutes.” Much of the military authoritarianism in imposing American military values on island traditional mores appeared to be without thought about the local impact rather than due to official racist policies by other than a few naval governors.</p>
                <p>150</p>
                <p>Prior to World War II, not only did the U.S. Navy on Guam fail to improve local civil liberties and governmental standards to anywhere near U.S. stan- dards, it also fell short in its strategic defense mis- sion of assuring the line of communications across the Pacific west of Hawai‘i. Military personnel to defend the island were clearly inadequate. The original compulsory Guam Militia was disbanded in 1937 owing to budget cuts. It was reinstituted as a small voluntary unit and in April 1941 was reor- ganized as the Insular Force Guard. The entire U.S. military presence numbered only 698 people. Of those, personnel in units that could be used in com- bat (i.e., sailors on armed vessels, U.S. Marines, and the Insular Force Guard) numbered only about 340 men. They were all simply cannon fodder in U.S. defense plans.</p>
                <p>Of the four naval vessels at Apra Harbor in late 1941, the most effective was the World War I-vin- tage minesweeper that served as a patrol ship, the 1,000-ton USS Penguin. It was armed with a few .50-caliber machine guns. The other fair-sized ves- sel was an old decommissioned oiler, the USS Rob- ert L. Barnes, affectionately known as the “Barney Maru,” which had two .50-caliber machine guns. The other two vessels were small “YP” patrol boats. A fifth vessel, Guam’s station ship, the USS Gold Star, was away on a trip to the Philippines when the war came.</p>
                <p>The Barney Maru, immobile and tied to buoys in Apra Harbor, served as a training ship for navy mess attendants, among whom 358 Chamorros had graduated by the end of 1940 to earn $21.00 a month. This was the same pay as Filipino and American seamen received. The difference was that Chamorros and Filipinos usually stayed at base pay for years, while white seamen “advanced quickly to higher rungs on the pay scale,” according to one Chamorro former mess attendant. Dozens of these Chamorro mess attendants were serving off Guam in the navy when the war started.</p>
                <p>The U.S. forces for the defense of Guam on the eve of World War II were thus fewer than in World War I and were eerily similar in weakness to the Spanish forces on Guam in 1898. Other than two</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 9</p>
                <p>salute cannons, there was no artillery on the island, just as in 1898. Critics of the navy, such as Willard Price in his 1934 book Japan’s Islands of Mystery, had long argued that, having allowed the surround- ing Micronesian islands to fall into alien hands, the United States could no longer defend Guam. Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner—who was head of the navy’s war plans division—in a letter in Octo- ber 1941 to the captain of the USS Gold Star wrote, “Guam is not really defendable no matter how many troops and fortifications you put there.”</p>
                <p>If the navy’s judgment in all the Orange Plans on the defense of Guam was faulty, then all the au- thoritarian restrictions imposed on the Chamorros for over forty years by the navy in the name of U.S. national security were needless. It would have made little difference to the defense of the island in 1941 if Chamorros had been granted U.S. citizenship or had been governing themselves.</p>
                <p>The failure of American government in prewar Guam cannot, however, be attributed solely to the U.S. Navy. The main mission of the military was one of defense, not civil development. The real cul- prit in Guam’s needlessly constricted civil develop- ment and inadequate military defenses was the U.S. Congress. By allowing the archaic colonial doctrine of the Supreme Court’s Insular Cases to stand in- stead of responding to the many appeals of the Cha- morros and Americans (mostly liberal Democrats) for full civil liberties and self-government in accord with the nation’s Constitution, the Congress itself perpetuated ineffective colonialism on Guam and still does.</p>
                <p>Judgments of military colonialism were doubtlessly far from the mind of the last prewar naval governor of Guam, Captain George J. McMillin, who knew only too well Guam could not be defended. In a spasm of war jitters in early 1941, the U.S. Con- gress appropriated $4,700,000 for defense projects on Guam. The island had been heavily damaged in November 1940 by a typhoon and was still recover- ing when the new appropriation was made. Nearly seventy American contractors arrived by December 1941, and work on new airfields, oil storage tanks</p>
                <p>THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY 1918-1941</p>
                <p>and other projects got under way, but all these ac- tivities would prove useless.</p>
                <p>Earlier, the last American military dependents, 104 women and children, had departed Guam on the USS Henderson except for one pregnant wife, Mrs. J.A.Hellmers. The last issue of the Guam Recorder in November 1941 did not say a word about the threat of war, but the cover showed the Henderson departing full of American families with the word Aloha alongside. Many Chamorros, alarmed by the evacuation and by blackout drills, began hoarding food, and some began to move to their Janchos for safety in anticipation of a Japanese attack.</p>
                <p>Japanese military aircraft and ships from Saipan had begun reconnaissance of Guam as early as March 1941, and by November, Japanese seaplanes were taking aerial photographs of the island with impunity. The U.S. State Department protested in vain to Tokyo. More ominous, formidable Japanese ground forces of over 5,500 soldiers in the South Seas Detachment from China, plus what would be- come the Fifty-fourth Navy Defense Force Guard (Keibitai, similar to the U.S. Marines) of about 450 men were being assembled in the Bonin Islands. The commander of these ground forces was Major General Tomitara Horii. He received his orders for “Operation G” on November 29: “The detachment will seize Guam.”</p>
                <p>The American high command in Washington was well aware of Japanese war preparations through intercepts and decoding of Japanese communica- tions. On November 24 the acting chief of naval</p>
                <p>151</p>
                <p>operations sent a secret message to all commands, warning, “Chances of favorable outcome of nego- tiations with Japan very doubtful. This situation coupled with statements of Japanese Government and movements of their naval and military forces indicate in our opinion that a surprise aggressive movement in any direction, including attack on Philippines or Guam, is a possibility.”</p>
                <p>On December 4, McMillin received a coded tele- gram to “destroy all secret and confidential publi- cations and other classified matter.... Retain mini- mum cryptographic channels necessary for essential communication.” On December 6, the navy radio station at Libugon received a message from Wash- ington, D.C., to destroy all remaining classified materials.</p>
                <p>Thus, the outbreak of war in the Pacific was ex- pected by everyone on Guam. Despite this expec- tation, the Chamorros and many Americans were confident that the United States would easily defeat the Japanese. This misplaced confidence was due to “childlike faith in the might and power of Ameri- ca,” wrote Chamorro historian Pedro C. Sanchez.</p>
                <p>In reality, the parable of the tribes was again about to overwhelm Guam, this time in the form of twentieth-century warfare in a terrible sequence of two massive invasions within three years. These invasions would bring greater destruction to the en- vironment and the culture of the island than all the previous alien intrusions, including even the origi- nal Spanish invasion of Guam two and a half cen- turies earlier.</p>

                <p>Dawn on Monday, December 8, 1941, on Guam, over 2,300 miles west of the international dateline, came four hours after the sunrise on Sunday, Decem- ber 7, at Pearl Harbor, about 1,400 miles east of the dateline. Nearly everyone on Guam was preparing for the celebration that day of the Feast of the Im- maculate Conception. Bishop Olano described the preparations: “It was a beautiful morning. People, especially the younger men and women, thronged the door of the Cathedral to attend Solemn High Mass in honor of the Immaculate Concepcion. The Mass was to begin at eight. The Cathedral was be- decked in gala attire, for Agafia, Guam, was ready for the celebration.”</p>
                <p>A little after 8:00 a.m., eleven-year-old Paul Jo- seph Bordallo at his father’s market in Agana was receiving a shipment of fish and lobsters from Mer- izo when he heard aircraft flying over Agana. He looked up to see nine planes, but they were flying so high he could not see that they were Japanese. At about the same time, in his office across the plaza from the cathedral, Governor McMillin was informing Paul’s father, B.J.Bordallo, of a tele- gram received earlier that morning from the U.S. Asiatic Fleet headquarters in Manila with the news that Pearl Harbor was under attack. McMillin had alerted the military command and summoned Bor- dallo because he owned a small fleet of taxis that</p>
                <p>152</p>
                <p>McMillin wanted to use to evacuate people from the capital.</p>
                <p>A few minutes later, and six miles away at Sumay, two Chamorros employed by the navy, Benito Wes- ley, the eighteen-year-old grandson of a New Eng- land whaler, and his friend Joaquin Sablan had just begun their daily chores in the Marine Corps offi- cers’ quarters when they heard the roar of aircraft. The young men rushed outside in time to see two warplanes with round red markings on their wings sweep by not more than a hundred feet over their heads. Bombs dropped from the planes over the nearby Pan American buildings and the big Stan- dard Oil fuel tank. The tank was hit and burst into flames that sent up massive grayish-black billows of oil smoke to tarnish the clear blue sky over Guam for the first—but not the last—time in the island’s history.</p>
                <p>Another bomb from a following aircraft struck the Pan American hotel kitchen and killed workers Larry Lujan Pangelinan and Teddy Flores Cruz, the first fatalities of the war on Guam. At the adjacent Pan American office building, Juan Wesley, Benito’s father, fled outside just as another bomb struck. Stunned by the blast, Juan looked down to see his intestines oozing from a slash in his abdomen. He ripped off his T-shirt and plugged the wound as he staggered off to his Sumay home. There he fortu-</p>

                <p>nately caught a truck to the Naval Hospital in Aga- na. Juan Wesley survived the wound and the war.</p>
                <p>Communion was ending in the Agana cathedral, and Bishop Olano asked a woman what was the cause of the commotion among the congregation. “Gerra, gerra, Sefor Obispo” (War, war, Sir Bish- op), she replied. The bishop completed the mass and hurried across the plaza to the governor’s office, where he learned that war was indeed under way. The governor closed all schools, stores, and offices; set up the evacuation of civilians from around mili- tary facilities; and mustered all military personnel. He also ordered the arrest of thirty-five Japanese immigrants to the island, notably José Shimizu and Mrs. Sawada as well as Samuel Shinohara—who had showed his sympathies by proudly flying a Jap- anese flag at his Agana home that morning.</p>
                <p>The Japanese planes turned to bombing military targets at the Piti navy yard, the Libugon radio towers, and vessels in and around Apra Harbor. Refugees from Sumay and Piti began to flee toward Agana, jamming the main road. In Apra, the Rob- ert Barnes was repeatedly punctured by bullets but remained afloat while the crew swam to safety. The old ship would later be towed to Saipan after Guam was captured by the Japanese.</p>
                <p>The Penguin was on patrol at sea the night of De- cember 7-8 and had sprung a leak in a boiler. It also lost radio communication, so it was out of contact with the navy command radio station in Agana. The old converted minesweeper returned to Piti just be- fore 8:00 a.m., and a third of the crew went home. The captain, Lieutenant James W. Haviland III, then received a handwritten note from Governor McMil- lin to put to sea immediately because of hostilities. Short of crew and at reduced speed, Guam’s only warship of sorts then chugged out of Apra Harbor to meet its fate.</p>
                <p>Three Japanese warplanes found the Penguin about a mile off Agat, and the pilots dove to the at- tack. Ensign Robert White, manning an anti-aircraft gun, was killed by strafing. Lieutenant Haviland and two sailors were seriously wounded as the Japa- nese riddled the ship with machine-gun bullets and the shrapnel of near misses from exploding bombs.</p>
                <p>153</p>
                <p>Leaving the Penguin dead in the water, the Japanese aircraft flew off to the north to refuel on Saipan.</p>
                <p>Unknown to the Americans, some of the Japanese fighter and bomber aircraft had made an extraor- dinarily long flight in November from their base in Japan to Saipan via the Bonins. These planes plus naval aircraft and the Seventeenth Air Unit of the aircraft carrier Seikawa from the Japanese navy base at Truk reinforced the seaplanes of the Eigh- teenth Air Unit at Tanapag, Saipan, in attacking Guam. The combat aircraft included the Mitsubishi A6M Navy Type O Carrier Fighter Reisen (Zero, or Zeke as it was called by the Americans). At the time this was the best combat aircraft in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>On the Penguin, Lieutenant Haviland, with part of his left arm blown off, ordered the crew to take off White’s body and the wounded men in the ship’s two life rafts (the one lifeboat was full of bullet holes) and then to scuttle the stricken ship before the Japanese returned. With insufficient room on the small rafts, uninjured men jumped into the wa- ter and swam safely to the Agat beaches after re- leasing the sea valves of the doomed Penguin. The little ship sank in the deep waters south of Orote Point. Once ashore, some of the uninjured sailors were armed to reinforce the Insular Force Guard in Agana.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, aliens, presumed to be Japanese, had been seen landing by canoes at daybreak; one group of five slipped ashore near Ritidian Point in the north, and another group landed near Inarajan in the south. The five at Ritidian were caught and in- terrogated. They turned out to be Chamorros from Saipan sent ahead by the Japanese to cut telephone lines and act as scouts and interpreters for the in- vading forces. The men said that the invasion would come the next day at Agana Bay. The infiltrators were crowded into the same Agana jail cell as the Japanese residents arrested earlier.</p>
                <p>McMillin thought the infiltrators’ warning was, in his words, “a trick to have the Marines move from Sumay to the Beach during the night, in order that they [the Japanese] might make a landing in the Apra Harbor area without opposition.” This would prove to be a costly misjudgment by McMillin.</p>
                <p>154</p>
                <p>McMillin also failed to give orders as planned previously for the thorough destruction of all mili- tary installations, stores, and facilities to deny their use by the Japanese. McMillin’s aide for civil affairs, Commander D.T. Giles, the next day told one of the naval staff radiomen, George Ray Tweed, “We are going to offer only token resistance and surrender.” Giles also gave Tweed permission to hide out in the countryside to avoid capture.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, on December 8 the Japanese be- gan to bomb Agana. The bombing was not inten- sive. Nonetheless, civilians fled in terror into boonie areas until the air attacks stopped around five in the afternoon. Hardly anyone remained in Agana or the main villages. That night, during the long hours of blackout, thousands of Chamorros huddled in the jungles in what would become a vigil of courageous despair for the next thirty-one months.</p>
                <p>The next morning the Japanese leisurely resumed their bombing. They struck the Libugon radio tow- ers and downtown Agana once more and strafed villages throughout the island during the day. Mc- Millin had the U.S. Marines at Sumay take up de- fensive positions in the butts of the rifle range on Orote Peninsula. The marines shot down one Japa- nese twin-engined medium bomber by .30-caliber machine-gun fire. The 125 officers and men (minus the twenty-eight enlisted marines and one officer as- signed elsewhere with the Insular Patrol) were un- der the command of Lieutenant Colonel William K. MacNulty. He and McMillin anticipated that the Japanese would land on the beaches near or inside Apra Harbor and come under the marines’ guns.</p>
                <p>To defend Agana, Governor McMillin assem- bled the three platoons of the Insular Force Guard. Each platoon numbered about twenty-eight Cha- morros armed with small arms, submachine guns, and .30-caliber Lewis machine guns. The force was divided into two under the command of Chief Boatswain Mates Robert Bruce Lane and Robert O’Brien, the latter one of the Penguin’s crew. They were reinforced by about fifteen marines from the Insular Patrol and sailors from the Barnes and the Penguin. None of the Chamorros had fired a ma- chine gun before, and some of the American staff</p>

                <p>The platoons of the Insular Force Guard were de- ployed on the night of December 9 in a loose perim- eter around the Plaza de Espafia under Lane. Six of the Penguin’s sailors were stationed at the Agana power plant. There was no time for anyone to dig in; they did not even have sand bags as protection. At 2:00 a.m. on December 10 nine Japanese troop- ships protected by warships began disembarking troops into landing boats at widely separate points off Guam. The landings took place at low tide, and in some places bamboo mats were laid on the coral so that the troops could walk over it. A battalion of army troops landed in Tumon Bay as the first wave on the northern beaches. Signal flares marked the landings. The Keibitai battalion with about 400 men followed as the second wave at Tumon but became lost. Their boats turned right and moved around Hospital Point. They then crossed the reef in eastern Agana Bay and waded to Apurguan-Dung- cas Beach just north of Agana.</p>
                <p>Twelve miles to the south, units of the main Japa- nese force in the South Seas Detachment with over 5,000 men landed at Bile Bay near Merizo. There they discovered there was no Merizo-Agat road that would lead them to Apra Harbor. They reembarked on their landing boats and then moved north around Facpi Point to land at the Agat beaches south of Orote Peninsula, where they expected to fight U.S. Marines guarding Apra Harbor. While the south- ern attack was being delayed, the northern waves of Japanese troops moved inland with bayonets fixed for close combat. Because the Keibitai landing at Apurguan-Dungcas Beach was closer to Agana than the battalion landing at Tumon, the Keibitai would reach the capital first. As squads of the Japa- nese fanned out on the Agana-Tamuning road along the beach, they encountered a jitney (a Filipino-style small bus made from a truck chassis) with seventeen Chamorros aboard who were fleeing Agana.</p>
                <p>In the dark, the invaders opened fire on the ve- hicle and then charged under the assumption that the passengers were hostile. The Japanese shot and bayoneted everyone inside, killing thirteen men and</p>

                <p>women and wounding three men. One young man, Gregorio San Nicholas, leaped from the back and escaped up the cliff behind the beach. Ben Limtiaco, one of the wounded, survived with partially para- lyzed legs from stab wounds. Bishop Olano, who passed the jitney later that day, reported it “full of</p>
                <p>cadavers. All killed by bayonets.” The assault troops then moved on down the road toward Agana, at- tacking other Chamorro civilians they came across.</p>
                <p>At the Plaza de Espana, the Chamorro and Amer- ican defenders waited with loaded guns in tense silence in the dim light. One of the Insular Force</p>
                <p>156</p>
                <p>Guards, Pedro Guerrero (Pedan) Cruz, manned a machine gun at the northeast corner of the pla- za closest to the Japanese. Pete Cruz later recalled that morning: “I was frightened when I heard the sound of metal hitting an object like a water can- teen. Then I saw some figures moving and I opened fire. I ceased to be afraid....I1 don’t know exactly how long I fired that machine gun, but I know I kept firing until it got jammed and I couldn’t reload it. Eventually, Lane told us to retreat, and we went to an area next to the Governor’s Palace where we abandoned our weapons.” Pete Cruz survived the war and would live a long life as an honored com- bat veteran until his death in March 2003.</p>
                <p>As the firefight erupted across the plaza, the Japa- nese were driven back twice. They then flanked the perimeter, shooting and bayoneting some defend- ers. The attackers then spread through the largely deserted town. The six American sailors from the Penguin who defended the power plant near Agana Beach were all killed in the initial assault. The Japa- nese mutilated the dead Americans.</p>
                <p>By then, Governor McMillin, who was in his of- fice overlooking the plaza, was ready to give up. He later wrote, “The situation was simply hope- less, resistance had been carried to the limit.” He had Chief Lane honk three blasts on the horn of an automobile in front of the building, and all fighting stopped around 5:45 a.m.</p>
                <p>After officers from both sides conferred in the pla- za, Japanese troops entered the governor’s residence and required McMillin, a heavy-set, six-foot-tall Annapolis graduate, to strip to his shorts. He was marched outside. There the Chamorro and Ameri- can military prisoners (some had fled into hiding) were being assembled in their undershorts in the pla- za and made to run a gauntlet. At McMillin’s sug- gestion, the Japanese released their compatriots held in the jail across the plaza so that some could act as interpreters. McMillin then was taken back into the governor’s residence, where between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m. on December 10, 1941, with Samuel Shinohara as interpreter, he signed a letter of surrender. The red and white flag of the Rising Sun was then raised on the main flagpole as the real sun rose over Guam.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the main Japanese force of the South Seas Detachment was still at sea moving north toward the Agat beaches. The marines at Orote learned by messenger of McMillin’s surrender be- fore any Japanese forces made contact with them. When the Japanese forces arrived at Orote from Agana, Lieutenant Colonel MacNulty surrendered his marines in compliance with McMillin’s official surrender. One U.S. officer described the surrender by the marines: “When they stood at attention while I lowered the colors, few could restrain their tears.” These frustrated men would spend nearly four years as prisoners without promotions, honors, or even a citation from the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>Apra Harbor fell to the Japanese without a fight, and the entire island was captured virtually intact. The elements of the South Seas Detachment landed from their transports in Apra Harbor rather than at Agat. Radio station equipment in Agana and Libu- gon and some stores, trucks, and facilities had been destroyed by the Americans, but 4,000 gallons of gasoline, a number of vehicles, and several major facilities fell undamaged into Japanese hands. Even the Agana power plant, for which six American sail- ors died, escaped destruction. The bulldozers and other heavy equipment and trucks of the American contractors also fell to the Japanese and would be used by them later in the construction of airstrips and fortifications.</p>
                <p>The capture of Guam had taken the Japanese less than six hours to accomplish once they landed. Ac- cording to McMillin’s report of the surrender (writ- ten in 1945 after he was released from a prisoner- of-war camp in Manchuria), those killed on the American side numbered between forty and fifty. Perhaps over 100 persons were wounded; the exact figures are unknown. Japanese casualties are also not known but reportedly included only ten men killed. The first days after the invasion, boonie dogs feasted on the dead bodies of Chamorros and Amer- icans sprawled along the sides of roads until local men led by Father Calvo were permitted to bury the fifteen Chamorros killed along the Apurguan-Aga- na road. Other bodies were also interred.</p>
                <p>The Japanese had expected the Americans to put</p>
                <p>THE Way OF THE SAMURAI 1941-1944</p>
                <p>up a stiff battle for Guam, which is one reason the main Japanese force in the south was so much larger than the Marine Corps units they planned to fight at Orote. Nowhere in his report did Governor McMil- lin explain why the defense of Guam was so inept, why he did not promptly alert the civilian popu- lation or order evacuation of areas near military targets after he learned of the Pearl Harbor attack early on the morning of December 8, why the main American fighting force—the U.S. Marine comple- ment at Sumay—did not fight at all, or why the poorly trained Insular Force Guard bore the brunt of the combat. Clearly, the American forces did not carry resistance “to the limit,” as McMillin later as- serted. After the war, it was reported that McMillin had received orders “not to resist to the limit,” in which case he disobeyed those orders in the fight in Agana but obeyed them in the surrender of the marines. Either way, he had bungled.</p>
                <p>American accounts of World War II gloss over the fact that the American abandonment of Guam in 1941 was an inglorious footnote in the histo- ries of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. In the early days of World War II in other places, such as Wake Island and Bataan, where the situa- tions were also “simply hopeless,” as McMillin claimed, American forces fought much more tena- ciously than they did on Guam. It was mainly the valiant Chamorros of the Insular Force Guard and a handful of tough U.S. sailors who upheld American military honor on Guam in those dark early days of World War II.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Major General Horii came ashore to assume command. He issued a proclamation that stressed the two main themes of Japan’s im- perial presence on Guam: a racist appeal to Asian solidarity and a threat of harsh punishment for any opposition.</p>
                <p>Guam was not, as sometimes asserted, the only territory of the United States to be occupied by for- eign forces in World War II. The U.S. islands of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutians were occupied in 1942 by the Japanese, but the indigenous Aleut inhabi- tants, except for an unfortunate handful left with some U.S. military weathermen to be captured, were</p>
                <p>157</p>
                <p>evacuated prior to the Japanese invasion. Guam, therefore, has the dubious distinction of being the only fully inhabited part of the United States to be occupied by an enemy in World War II.</p>
                <p>Under the assumption that Japan would per- manently retain Guam, the Japanese authorities renamed the island as well as Agana and all the villages. Guam became Omiyajima (Island of the Imperial Court), while Agana became Akashi (Red City). As the Chamorros would learn, the symbol- ism of the color red was ominously appropriate to life under the already bloody bayonets of their new conquerors.</p>
                <p>New Aliens, Old Methods</p>
                <p>The Japanese quickly rounded up all the Americans and foreigners that they could find, including Mrs. Hellmers and her newborn daughter. Bishop Olano and all the non-Chamorro priests were interned lat- er. The Japanese reported 483 U.S. prisoners (368 military and 115 civilians, including some Catholic priests), all of whom were shipped to Japan in Janu- ary 1942.</p>
                <p>In Japan, they were joined by thirty Chamorro employees of Pan American captured when Wake Island fell on December 23. The Japanese inexpli- cably treated these civilians as military prisoners of war. Ten unfortunate Chamorro employees on Wake had been killed, as were four Chamorro mess attendants on the battleship USS Arizona when it was sunk at Pearl Harbor. Many of the older Ameri- cans and Chamorros from Guam and Wake would die in the harsh conditions of Japan’s internment camps.</p>
                <p>Chamorros of the Insular Force Guard and other local units were initially interned. Twenty-six Cha- morro nurses, unsung heroines of the war period, were also treated as prisoners and forced to work involuntarily throughout the occupation until July 1944. The Japanese immediately put the Chamorro men of the local military units to work as unpaid fieldworkers and as stevedores to unload ships in Apra Harbor. Throughout the early period of the occupation, a number of Insular Force Guard mem-</p>
                <p>158</p>
                <p>bers were beaten and tortured by the Japanese to obtain any military information they might have had. Many internees worked as involuntary min- ers in an open-pit manganese mine the Japanese at- tempted to operate in Libugon until the project was abandoned later.</p>
                <p>The nearly 6,000 Japanese troops constituted the largest military force to occupy Guam up until that time. To house all these men, the Japanese took over every public building in Agana, including the cathe- dral and the churches. The troops also looted many homes and stores. They bivouacked in tents in the plaza and other open spaces. Driving on the left side of roads, Japanese vehicles caused a number of ac- cidents with the locals until all civilian cars, jitneys, and trucks were confiscated.</p>
                <p>Guam historian Pedro C. Sanchez described the early days of the occupation: “And contributing to the crowded scene, there were hundreds of cavalry horses as well as horses used for carrying machine guns and other war equipment. With the horses came swarms of flies that were literally ten times as big as local flies.... There was the smell of pick- led radish (daicon), dried seaweed, fish, sea-slugs and sea-cucumbers and the odor of soybean soup (misu)...from every corner of the city where hungry troops were preparing their meals in open fires.”</p>
                <p>Civil government under the Japanese was quickly placed under a civilian affairs section, called the Minseisho, of the Imperial Japanese Army, which administered civil affairs for several weeks until mid-January 1942. Every resident had to obtain and wear a strip of cloth with Japanese characters iden- tifying the bearer. This pass was issued only once. Called lisiensan ga‘lago (dog tag) by the Chamor- ros, the pass was required until late 1942, when life became more routine.</p>
                <p>The Japanese banned circulation of American money and gradually reduced the use of the English language. In the first days of occupation, American dollars could be turned in for Japanese yen, but at an extremely unfavorable rate of exchange. As a re- sult, many Chamorros hid their American money. Rationing was implemented through coupons for purchases of all commodities. Monthly quotas were</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>imposed on villagers for crops and other food to be raised for the Japanese garrison. Food stocks and supplies of ordinary goods soon ran out, and locally owned stores closed down. Only the stores of the new Japanese Kohatsu Company (which occupied the Atkins, Kroll store) and the J.K.Shimizu Com- pany eventually remained open in Agana.</p>
                <p>All bars were shut down, and the sale of alcoholic drinks was forbidden, even sake. This ban revived a lively bootleg business in tuba and aguardiente, just as in prohibition days back in the 1920s. A strict daily curfew was imposed from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. As food dwindled, Chamorros reverted to sub- sistence farming and fishing. Carabao carts once more became the primary means of civilian trans- portation, and federico nuts again became a food staple of the Chamorros. A barter system emerged among Chamorros and Japanese. Eggs were so pop- ular as items of barter that the whole system came to be called kékan tamago, the Japanese words for “exchange eggs.”</p>
                <p>The entire population of Sumay was swiftly evict- ed in the first few days to make way for a Japanese garrison, and five Chamorritas were raped by Jap- anese troops in the takeover. Schools reopened in April 1942 with Japanese sailors teaching the Japa- nese language, but, since much of the population was scattered into the countryside, school enroll- ment was low. Japanese civilian teachers and their families arrived by mid-1942 to replace the sail- ors, and Chamorro assistant teachers were trained. School programs and student enrollment on Guam slowly expanded, but the war years left a gap in the education of many of the island’s children since the main subject was how to speak the Japanese language.</p>
                <p>In November, two Japanese Catholic priests, Monsignor Sen’emon Fukahori and Father Shigeru (Peter) Komatzu, arrived with Bishop Olano’s per- mission. As citizens of non-belligerent Spain, Bishop Olano and his secretary had been freed after they arrived in Kobe with other prisoners from Guam and were staying with Jesuits in Tokyo until they could leave Japan. They were not permitted to re- turn to Guam.</p>
                <p>The Japanese occupation. Army Major General Tomitara Horii (left) was in command of the invasion of Guam on December 10, 1941, and of the occupation until January 14, 1942, when his forces were moved to Rabaul. Chamorro nurses and Japanese naval medical personnel (below) served valiantly throughout the oc- cupation until 1944 under increasingly harsh condi- tions. (Naval Archives, Washington, D.C.)</p>
                <p>160</p>
                <p>Along with their troops, the Japanese also brought in forty-two prostitutes, mostly Korean “comfort women,” and recruited about fifteen local “Mon- day Ladies” for four houses of prostitution. These women also became informants for the Japanese. It was not long until a few local women became girl- friends of Japanese soldiers, just as they had with Spanish, Filipino, and American military men.</p>
                <p>Signs were quickly posted all over Guam on the walls of offices, police stations, and the new sentry boxes called kobans, with the English words “You must stop here and bow to us.” Bowing was alien to the Chamorros, but they quickly learned that they must stop, turn, and bow to where the signs were posted, even if the place was unoccupied. Chamor- ros were also obliged to bow as a sign of respect to virtually all Japanese individuals. If the bow was too perfunctory or too obsequious, it brought a swift kick or some other punishment. One Chamor- ro, Juan Manibusan, the father of five children, had his spinal cord broken by Japanese and Saipanese policemen who beat him brutally when he failed to bow properly to the Dededo Police Station. Para- lyzed, he died as a result of the beating.</p>
                <p>More severe punishment was equally swift when two Chamorro youths were arrested for crimes. Al- fred Leon Guerrero Flores was caught smuggling a note in December 1941 to an American prisoner about what was to be done with some dynamite hidden at the harbor. Francisco Borja Won Pat was charged the same month with stealing from a ware- house of his former American employer in Sumay. The Japanese authorities apparently decided to make examples of these boys.</p>
                <p>On January 6, a large group of people, including family members of the accused, was rounded up and marched to Pigo Cemetery. There the two Chamor- ro youths were made to stand in front of freshly dug graves. A taichd, as Japanese officers were called, read the offenses in English. After a prayer by Fa- ther Oscar Calvo, the boys were blindfolded, and they waved good-bye. The two were then shot by a firing squad and fell back into their open graves.</p>
                <p>While the people of Guam were uncomfortably settling down under the harsh Japanese administra-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>tion, the war elsewhere was going extremely well for Japan. When Hong Kong fell to the Japanese after Christmas 1941, massed troops held a mili- tary parade in Agana’s Plaza de Espafia. The Japa- nese held public celebrations again in January 1942 when Manila fell, in February when Singapore sur- rendered, and in May when Lieutenant General Jonathan Wainwright surrendered at Corregidor. Chamorros were required to attend the victory pa- rades and other gatherings to yell banzai on cue for the cameras of their conquerors.</p>
                <p>Japanese rule on Guam relaxed in mid-Janu- ary 1942, when Horii and his army troops of the South Seas Detachment sailed away to take part in the battle for Rabaul in Melanesia. The occupa- tion of Guam was transferred to a Japanese naval guard force with a garrison of approximately 300 men. With the army’s departure, administration of day-to-day civil affairs over the Guam Chamorros was transferred from the army’s Minseisho to the navy’s Minseibu (Department of Civil Administra- tion) with its own police under the command of the Japanese Navy’s Fifth Base Force with headquarters in Saipan that in turn were under the Fourth Fleet headquarters at Truk in command of all Microne- sia. The Japanese planned to integrate Guam and the Northern Marianas. About fifty Chamorros from Saipan and Rota served as staff assistants, po- lice investigators, and interpreters for the Minseibu. Although constituting a moderating buffer between local civilians and Japanese sailors and marines, Minseibu administration was not benign: after the war, twenty-three of fifty-one cases of war crimes would be conducted against Minseibu personnel, including Chamorros from the Northern Marianas.</p>
                <p>The senior Saipanese was Juan Borja, known as Tun Juan Buko (bucho or buko meant “boss” in Jap- anese), who worked as liaison with Guam’s village commissioners and Agana leaders through Vicente U. Zafra, the chief commissioner under the Ameri- cans at the time of surrender. Agana was organized into districts similar to the old Spanish barrios, each under a Chamorro leader whom the Japanese called a kucho. The Chamorro village commissioners be- came sonchos. Each district and village was headed</p>
                <p>THE Way OF THE SAMURAI 1941-1944</p>
                <p>by a Japanese military official called a taicho, usu- ally a noncommissioned officer. The kuchds and sonchos imposed communal work quotas and as- sembled the people for propaganda sessions.</p>
                <p>Later, as the war swung back toward Guam and conditions deteriorated, the lot of the involuntary Chamorro kuch6ds and sonchds became extremely difficult. They had to endure considerable abuse from their own people who objected to the Japanese demands, yet they had to carry out those demands without reporting malcontents, who would have been arrested by the Japanese police. Under the kuchos and sonchos, most able-bodied Chamorro men would be mobilized in 1944 into forced labor gangs to construct airstrips as well as other military projects.</p>
                <p>In January 1943, the Japanese organized three companies of unarmed paramilitary youth groups called seinendan among selected Chamorro students and nisei teenagers. The seinendan were gathered at times in camps for training and practiced marching until early 1944, when all Chamorro youths were conscripted into forced labor gangs along with men to build fortifications to defend against the looming American invasion. Many of these people would die when they were trapped in the fighting along the beachheads.</p>
                <p>The prewar Chamorro chief of police on Guam, Juan A. Roberto, as well as most other local police- men, continued to serve under the Minseibu. Un- der Japanese military law on Guam, suspects were presumed guilty until they proved their innocence. Beatings and sometimes torture were part of inter- rogations. An entire family could be punished with death for the wrongdoings of one of its members. For the Japanese, these were normal conditions for an occupied area in wartime. The discipline of the Japanese was harsh, but, until 1944, most ci- vilians on Guam were not under extreme hardship. Although martial law was in effect, the Japanese left most Chamorros alone. Discipline varied from village to village, depending on the personalities of the taichos in charge. Some taichos and officers in Agana treated Chamorros with respect, while oth- ers became little dictators.</p>
                <p>161</p>
                <p>The islanders called the most brutal Japanese tek‘cho na taich6 in Chamorro, a play on words that meant that the taichos were so mean “they eat you up” (tek‘cho describes carnivorous animals that prey on other animals). The islanders adopted an at- titude of guarded, submissive neutrality toward the Japanese while hoping for the return of the Ameri- cans. A number of Chamorros secretly listened on shortwave radios to war news broadcast out of San Francisco by station KGEI. To help keep up their morale, among themselves the Chamorros sang a song with the refrain “Oh, Mr. Sam, Sam, my dear Uncle Sam, Won’t you please come back to Guam?”</p>
                <p>With the Chamorros cowed, the Japanese police focused on searches for radios, firearms, American money, and other illegal items and on locating those few American servicemen who had eluded capture at the surrender of the island. By comparing Ameri- can military duty rosters with prisoner-of-war rolls, the Japanese determined that six American sailors were still loose on Guam. Two were from the Pen- guin crew and four from the Agana naval radio sta- tion staff. These six men, like many Chamorros at the time, believed that American forces would soon return, and they thought they could hide out until then.</p>
                <p>Rumors about the American holdouts grew to the point that the Japanese soon heard that the men were in the Yona area. The police concentrated their search there while they rounded up people for in- terrogation accompanied by savage beatings. The Americans split up and scattered to new locations with the assistance of Chamorros who gave them food, cigarettes, and firearms.</p>
                <p>One of the holdouts was Radioman First Class George Tweed. He patched up a radio and for sev- eral months clandestinely distributed editions of the Guam Eagle that he typed up with news of the war learned from San Francisco station KGEI. Despite misgivings by some Chamorros and at times the tor- ture of others, no one informed on the Americans, and they all remained free for months. One stalwart Chamorro, Joaquin Limtiaco, was beaten viciously numerous times.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, in September 1942, the Japa-</p>
                <p>162</p>
                <p>nese caught three of the holdouts near Yona; they were L.W.Jones, L.L.Krump, and A. Yablonsky. They had split from Tweed, who was indiscreet; he sometimes attended Chamorro social functions in disguise. The three American sailors were be- headed and bayoneted by the Japanese troops and Saipanese policemen.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, two other sailors, A.J. Tyson and C.B. Johnson, hid for six months on the ranch of Frank D. Perez at Oka, north of Agana in a seaside area near the site of the present Guam Memorial Hospital. There they were often visited by Father Jesus Baza Duenas. The two Americans were guided by Perez to a safer location at the ranch of Tommy Torres at Mataguac in the Mount Machanao area in the north. The Japanese soon traced the two sailors, and a special unit of fifty Japanese troops assigned to capture the Americans arrested Tommy Torres at his ranch. They compelled him to lead them to the two holdouts in October 1942. Both sailors were shot on the spot.</p>
                <p>That left only Tweed. With the help of several Chamorros at great risk to themselves and their families, Tweed had moved several times. For about eight months he was hidden in Yona by the Manuel B. and Pedro R. Cruz family until he ended up in October 1942 in a cavelike crevasse on a densely forested, rocky cliffside at Toguac near Double Reef on the northwest coast of Guam. There he was safely sheltered in lonely isolation by the family of Antonio Cruz Artero for nearly twenty-one months until the American reinvasion. Prudently, Artero was careful to tell no one except a few members of his family about Tweed.</p>
                <p>Chamorros continued to suffer because of Tweed. More and more Chamorros were brutalized by the Japanese and Saipanese police for information about him. Among those beaten were B. J. Bordal- lo and his sons Ricardo (Ricky) and Paul, none of whom knew where Tweed was. The older Bordallo was given thirty days to find Tweed or be executed. He walked all over the island but never seriously attempted to find the radioman. The Japanese did not execute him but instead put him in charge of garbage collection in Agana. His son Ricky would</p>

                <p>later serve two terms as governor of Guam in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
                <p>Tweed became a secondary issue for the Japanese as Guam came under attack by American aircraft and submarines. These attacks began in January 1943, when a Japanese cargo carrier, the 8,360- ton Tokai Maru (Eastern Sea), was damaged inside Apra Harbor by a torpedo from the submarine USS Flying Fish. Two torpedoes fired from outside the Calalan Bank traveled over the bank into the old caldera grande. One struck but did not sink the To- kai Maru. Seven months later, the submarine USS Snapper sent four torpedoes across Apra, one of which hit the stern of the luckless Tokai Maru. In a quirk of fate, the Tokai Maru was anchored over the old Cormoran. The Tokai sank and came to rest nearly on top of the German raider. Decades later, these nautical victims of two wars would become popular sites for Japanese scuba divers, who would flock to Guam as tourists.</p>
                <p>As the American threat grew, the Japanese in- creased the size of their Guam garrison and pushed the construction of airstrips. A strip on Orote Penin- sula was started in October 1943 on the site of the Sumay golf course. In November 1943, the military took over total command of all administration in Japanese Micronesia, including the Marianas. Since 1936, administration of local civilians in the region had been shared with the South Seas Colonization Company under the Ministry of Overseas Affairs. In March 1944, the Minseibu for civil affairs was dissolved, and the last buffer between Chamorros and Japanese troops on a daily basis disappeared. By early 1944, the Japanese forces on Guam num- bered only about 5,000 men, of whom about 700 were combat troops, 1,700 were in construction battalions, and over 2,000 were aviation personnel for the aircraft at Orote airstrip and a new strip on the island’s central plateau at Tiyan that would be- come the U.S. Naval Air Station after the war and then the Guam International Airport.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the world, the Anglo-Ameri- can combined chiefs of staff met in Cairo in Decem- ber 1943 and agreed on a Pacific strategy to defeat Japan by waging two major offensives simultane-</p>
                <p>THE Way OF THE SAMURAI 1941-1944</p>
                <p>ously. One major thrust, led by General Douglas MacArthur, was to advance from New Guinea to the Philippines. The other offensive, similar to the old Orange Plans, would advance under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz from the Gilberts and Marshalls across the central Pacific to the Marianas, where a strategic bombing force was to be established to pound the home islands of Japan.</p>
                <p>With American successes from late 1943 into ear- ly 1944 in the invasions of the Gilbert and Marshall islands and the destruction of Japanese ships at Truk Lagoon in February 1944, the Japanese government realized the Marianas would inevitably be invaded. The Japanese also knew that the new B-29 super- bomber of the Americans with a cruising radius of 1,500 miles could bomb the home islands of Japan from the Marianas. Guam is 1,350 flight miles from Tokyo. Therefore, the American drive across the central Pacific had to be repulsed in an “Absolute National Defense Sphere” that included the Bonins, the Marianas, and Palau. Guam, as the lynchpin of this sphere, would once again be the victim of mas- sive foreign geopolitical forces. In preparation for the coming battles, the Japanese began ruthlessly to prepare their Mariana defenses. Chamorros were ordered to construct Dékugo (air-raid shelters in Japanese) and to stock them with food and supplies. Most bokugo were dugouts topped with coconut logs as well as tunnels dug into cliffs and hillsides.</p>
                <p>The Japanese had not planned originally to con- struct large-scale fortifications on Guam and thus did not have much heavy construction equipment on the island. As of June 1943, the Chamorro population totaled 23,374 persons, according to a Japanese census, and was inadequate to provide the manpower to build defenses and the new airstrip. So the Japanese brought in hundreds of Koreans and Okinawans as laborers to back up the Japanese engineer battalions and conscripted Chamorros. The Japanese also put to use the American bull- dozers and trucks captured when McMillin hastily surrendered.</p>
                <p>For combat troops to reinforce the Marianas, the only Japanese reserves available were the di- visions of the Japanese Kwantung Army that had</p>
                <p>163</p>
                <p>been sitting largely unused in Manchuria to block any potential Soviet invasion of Japanese-occupied China. In February 1944, the Twenty-ninth Infan- try Division of the Kwantung Army under Lieuten- ant General Takeshi Takashina with nearly 10,000 soldiers was ordered to the Marianas. The division was joined by units with 5,100 men from the Kwan- tung’s First and Eleventh infantry divisions; this sec- ond group was designated the Sixth Expeditionary Force under Major General Toyashi Shigematsu.</p>
                <p>Events overtook the Japanse defense plans when the Americans launched carrier-based aircraft at- tacks in February 1944 against the Orote airstrip followed by frequent islandwide air raids. Troop- ships en route to Guam with the three regiments of Twenty-ninth Division units aboard were attacked by the submarine USS Trout in February near Saipan. One transport, the Sakito Maru, sank, with approximately 2,300 men lost along with tanks and equipment. The remaining ships limped into Saipan. One regiment went on to Tinian, and the others went to Guam. Meanwhile, a convoy with the Sixth Expeditionary Force escaped and arrived at Apra Harbor in March. With the arrival of these units, a new and by far the darkest chapter in Guam’s oc- cupation by Japan began.</p>
                <p>Militarism Amok</p>
                <p>Lieutenant General Takashina assumed command of the entire island in March 1944 and imposed harsh security measures through the Kempeitai mil- itary police of the Japanese army, which replaced the navy’s Minseibu civilian police. Guam was now placed under command of the Thirty-first Japanese Army’s Mariana District Group. With the army also came units of the Kaikontai, whose job was to provide the combat troops with food and supplies. Kaikontai headquarters was in the center of the is- land between Ordot and Mangilao at a place called Tai, where the Japanese laid out a large agricultural plantation along with fifteen other farm sites on the island taken from the Chamorros and on which they were forced to work.</p>
                <p>Forced labor for all Chamorro males over twelve</p>
                <p>164</p>
                <p>years old had been in effect since mid-1943, but under the Kaikontai agricultural quotas and work requirements increased drastically for all Chamor- ros, including women, youths of the seinendan, and old people. To augment the labor pool, the Japanese closed all schools and drafted everyone but small children, even Japanese civilians, to work. While men and boys worked mostly in labor battalions for heavy construction, notably on the big new airfield at Tiyan, females and older men worked primarily in the fields. New rice paddies were planted all over the island. In the paddies, the Kaikontai used nico- tine salt sulfur as an insecticide. Runoff from the paddies polluted some lagoons, killing considerable reef marine life and permanently damaging patches of the Merizo lagoon.</p>
                <p>For the most part, civilian laborers after mid- 1943 worked without compensation. Some workers received a subsistence ration of food, but most had to supply their own. They became slave laborers, working sometimes twenty-four hours at a stretch. Koreans and some Okinawans worked alongside the locals but were treated better than the Chamor- ros by the Japanese overseers. Many of the Koreans and Okinawans would die along with the Japanese and Chamorros when the Americans invaded the is- land, and the remainder would be deported to their homelands after the war.</p>
                <p>Despite the increase in agricultural production spurred by the Kaikontai, food was insufficient to support the new army units on Guam after March 1944. An extremely rainless dry season in the first six months of 1944 retarded local food production. The Japanese had earlier introduced to the Mari- anas (probably in the late 1930s) the giant African snail Achatina fulica, which grows to seven inches. It became a food source for the troops. Although edible, the snail also destroys crops, and it became a widespread pest on Guam after World War II and remains so today.</p>
                <p>Malnutrition began to affect everyone on the is- land. The Chamorros resorted to eating more of the plentiful cycad seeds of fadang, as they had done in the past in times of food shortages. Few civilians had shoes—the Japanese requisitioned them, or they</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>wore out—and most wore sandals called zoris made with leather thongs and soles from old tires. People began to be infected by hookworms that entered the body through bare feet as zoris wore out and could not be replaced.</p>
                <p>By April 1944, American submarines and long- range PBY Catalina seaplanes were photographing the Marianas for targets in preparation for inva- sion. The U.S. operation to retake the Marianas was code-named FORAGER. It was to be the largest in- vasion of the war up until that time. A tight block- ade was imposed by the American forces around all the islands to choke off all supplies to the Japanese.</p>
                <p>On April 8, the submarine USS Seahorse torpe- doed the 6,780-ton Japanese submarine tender Aratama Maru near the eastern coast of Guam. The burning ship made it into Talofofo Bay, where it sank three days later. The same day the Seahorse also damaged the 1,915-ton cargo ship Kizugawa Maru, which would be sunk in 130 feet of water in the middle of Apra Harbor two months later by air attacks. These wrecks remain in place today, ghostly hiding places for lobsters and fish.</p>
                <p>U.S. Army Air Force B-24 heavy bombers began to bomb Saipan and Guam for the first time in May, when they accompanied navy PBY Catalinas. In a raid on May 6, five U.S. planes were shot down by Japanese fighters, but American air power soon overwhelmed the Japanese air defenses. The B-24s began to bomb the Marianas regularly. In early June, Fast Carrier Task Force 58 of Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher unleashed a withering air assault against the Marianas that destroyed 150 Japanese planes in the air and on the ground.</p>
                <p>From then on, the Americans ruled the seas and the skies of the Marianas. A Japanese officer on Guam wrote, “It is especially pitiful that we cannot control the air. We can only clench our fists with anger and watch.” American dominance in the skies turned life on the ground into hell as U.S. planes strafed and bombed Japanese, Koreans, Okinawa- ns, Filipinos, and Chamorros alike. Antiaircraft fire, however, remained formidable, and falling shrapnel at times killed and wounded people on the ground. Falling shrapnel also triggered hundreds of delayed-</p>
                <p>THE Way OF THE SAMURAI 1941-1944</p>
                <p>action antipersonnel mines emplaced by the Japa- nese; the mines would pop up and explode unex- pectedly after raids.</p>
                <p>Despite the bombing, the Japanese continued to construct ground defenses, mainly along the west- ern side of the island. Reefs and lagoons were stud- ded with underwater obstacles, barbed wire, and mines. Concrete strongpoints with machine guns, mortars, and light artillery provided mutually sup- porting enfilade and direct fire coverage of the beaches. Scores of dummy cannons made of coco- nut logs were mounted in lightly defended areas all around the coasts and on Cocos Island. Tunnel sys- tems were embedded in the hills that overlooked po- tential landing sites, particularly in the ridges above Asan and in Mount Alifan behind Agat. Tokyo also approved in 1944 the use of germ warfare against American forces, but such use was not undertaken.</p>
                <p>Conditions on Guam worsened dramatically on June 15, 1944, D-Day at Saipan, when U.S. forc- es began the invasion of the Marianas. While U.S. Marines fought their way onto Saipan’s beaches, forty-six navy fighters and ninety-six dive-bombers blasted Guam. These intensive aerial attacks were followed the next day by a massive naval gunfire bombardment of Guam for three hours from the battleships USS Pennsylvania and USS Idaho and other ships of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance’s Fifth Fleet. Later, naval fire sank the Japanese 6,870-ton auxiliary minelayer Nichiya Maru, which was tied up for repairs at a pier at Cabras Island. The remains of the Nichiya still lie in over sixty feet of water next to the old GORCO pier in Guam’s Commercial Port.</p>
                <p>Because of the intensity of the June 16 bombard- ment, the Japanese commanders thought that the Americans were about to invade the island. How- ever, to their surprise and relief, dawn the next day revealed a clear horizon around Guam. The Ameri- cans had inexplicably sailed away. What the Japa- nese did not know was that the U.S. landings on Guam had been scheduled for June 18 (called W- Day in U.S. war plans). Because of the unexpected approach of the Japanese Combined Fleet from the Philippines toward the Marianas on June 16, and</p>
                <p>165</p>
                <p>also owing to the tenacious Japanese defense of Saipan, W-Day for Guam had to be postponed.</p>
                <p>The American Fifth Fleet turned from the Mari- anas to meet the Japanese Combined Fleet in the June 16-18 Battle of the Philippine Sea (called the “Great Marianas Turkey Shoot” by irreverent U.S. pilots). In that titanic battle to the west of the Mari- anas, the Japanese lost three aircraft carriers and 476 planes. By this time, both the Orote and the Tiyan airstrips had been bombed out. When some Japanese naval aircraft tried to land on Orote air- strip on June 19, most crashed on the crater-pocked runway. The Battle of the Philippine Sea left Lieu- tenant General Takashina and his ground forces on Guam on their own to face the coming invasion.</p>
                <p>Takashina knew that the respite from invasion was only temporary, and the June 16 bombardment had confirmed where the landings would likely come. He concentrated his main combat units along the coast from Adelup Point around through Agat, and he had them dig in for a stand to the death. The senior Japanese general on the island was Lieuten- ant General Hideyoshi Obata, commander of the Thirty-first Army for all the Marianas. Stranded on Guam en route to Saipan from Palau, he left the command of Guam in Takashina’s hands but for unknown reasons approved a futile effort to rein- force his beleaguered men still fighting on Saipan.</p>
                <p>This effort began on the night of June 21-22, when a task force of two battalions with about 600 troops sailed in thirteen large boats from Guam to Rota, from which the force was to move on to Saipan. At Rota in rough seas in the dark, two boats overturned, and over 100 men drowned. One bat- talion then returned to Guam over the next few nights. This harebrained maneuver was symptom- atic of the confused state of the Japanese command. The Americans would not occupy Rota until after Japan’s surrender in 1945, so the Japanese troops left on the island never fought and in fact were starving by the war’s end along with the local peo- ple on the island.</p>
                <p>In the meantime the senior American commander in the Pacific, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, whose full military title was Commander in Chief of U.S.</p>
                <p>166</p>
                <p>Forces Pacific and Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPAC- CINCPOA), decided July 21 was to be the new W- Day for Guam. The code name for the Guam por- tion of FORAGER was STEVEDORE. American photo missions and bombing strikes against the Marianas increased in tempo in late June and early July 1944. One pilot of a Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bomber in these combat raids on Guam was a young naval lieutenant, George Herbert Walker Bush, flying from the light aircraft carrier USS San Jacinto. He would be shot down close to Chichi Jima. Rescued, he went on to become the president of the United States in 1988-1992.</p>
                <p>In final preparation for the Guam invasion, American aircraft and ships constantly attacked the island day and night for thirteen straight days, be- ginning on July 8. No one on Guam moved around by day. Under these conditions, the civilian popula- tion of Guam hindered Japanese troop movements. The Chamorros, being pro-American, also posed security problems. As a consequence, the Japanese cracked down ruthlessly on the local people to pre- vent espionage and sabotage, real or imagined. The Japanese believed Tweed was transmitting by radio to the Americans intelligence information supplied to him by Chamorro spies. In reality, Tweed did not have a working radio.</p>
                <p>Japanese discipline became brittle. When human will is driven to a pitch of extreme anxiety, it tends to snap suddenly when faced with overwhelming stress, even in seemingly well-disciplined military units. On Guam, the breakdown of Japanese mili- tary morale and discipline was manifested in nu- merous mindless atrocities against Chamorros. Be- headings, rapes, and shootings of civilians occurred, mostly in the center and south of the island. In con- trast, in Yigo the taicho, who was in love with a Chamorro girl, protected the local villagers against the harshest measures ordered by Agana.</p>
                <p>A bizarre atrocity was the case of José Lizama Charfauros, who was foraging for food in the jun- gles of Fena when he encountered a Japanese pa- trol. The patrol leader made Charfauros kneel and then chopped at his back and neck with a sword. Left to die, Charfauros was found by friends days</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>later, his wounds filled with maggots. The maggots helped save his life by cleaning out infection. Thirty- five years later, José Charfauros was still alive and happy, but with a large, half-inch-deep scar at the rear of his neck where the sword of the inept samu- rai had penetrated.</p>
                <p>In a more deadly incident in July, the Japanese arrested Father Duenas in Inarajan. The priest had often angered occupation authorities by opposing official directives and by denigrating the two Japa- nese priests on Guam as propagandists for Japan. The police also believed Duenas knew of Tweed’s whereabouts. The outcome was the arrest of the priest along with his nephew, former Island Attor- ney Eduardo Duenas. The police tortured the men before beheading them on July 12 along with Vi- cente Baza. Juan (Mali) Pangelinan, who had also helped Tweed, was also executed.</p>
                <p>The irony of this tragedy is that on July 10 at the time the priest, his nephew, and Mali Pangelinan were all being tortured to reveal information about Tweed, the American holdout was being rescued by the U.S. Navy on the northwest coast at Toguac. Tweed signaled U.S. ships with a mirror and hand- made semaphore flags. The destroyer USS McCall sent a boat to shore and took Tweed off.</p>
                <p>The radioman became an instant, if transitory, war hero in the United States, with photographs and stories in Life magazine. Newspapers dubbed him “the ghost of Guam,” and he was used in war bond drives. In September 1944, after Guam was retaken by the Americans, Tweed would return for a reunion with his Chamorro benefactors. Tweed’s status as a hero, however, was tarnished in the eyes of many Chamorros when his memoir, Robinson Crusoe, USN, written with journalist Blake Clark, was published in 1945.</p>
                <p>Tweed-Clark wrote in the book that Mali Pange- linan had revealed to Duenas in confessional that he, Pangelinan, was helping the American. The book also related that Father Duenas violated the confessional by telling, under torture, the Japanese of Pangelinan’s complicity. Pangelinan was then ar- rested and tortured, and he in turn betrayed Anto- nio Artero as the last protector of Tweed, according</p>
                <p>THE Way OF THE SAMURAI 1941-1944</p>
                <p>to the Tweed-Clark account. Regardless of who be- trayed whom, by the time the Japanese closed in on the Artero ranch, Tweed had already been rescued, and the Artero family, alerted by friends, was hid- ing in Tweed’s secret crevasse at Toguac. Wisely, the Arteros did not come out until after the liberation.</p>
                <p>Many Chamorros resented Tweed’s accusations against Father Duenas, whom they considered to be a martyr whose death may well have been caused by Tweed’s remaining free. In March 1945, the priest’s body was exhumed and reburied under the altar of the St. Joseph Church in Inarajan where he had served. A Catholic boys’ high school would be con- structed at Tai in 1948 and named the Father Jesus Baza Duenas Memorial School.</p>
                <p>Also in the future, General Motors would present a new Chevrolet sedan to Antonio Artero on behalf of the American people in recognition of Artero’s bravery and loyalty. Tweed returned to Guam for the public presentation of the car in the Plaza de Espafia in September 1946, but the occasion was marred by a demonstration of Chamorros against Tweed. Artero nonetheless accepted the car (he and Tweed remained friends) and also accepted from Admiral Nimitz America’s highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom.</p>
                <p>Tweed meanwhile retracted his accusations against Father Duenas, blaming coauthor Blake Clark for errors in the book, but Tweed never re- turned to Guam after 1946. A grade-B Hollywood movie of Tweed’s war exploits, No Man Is an Island, appeared in 1962 but was filmed, in Hollywood schmaltzy unreality, in the Philippines with support- ing actors speaking in Tagalog, to the amusement of Chamorros who saw the film. After his retirement from the navy, Tweed became a farmer in Grant’s Pass, Oregon, and died in an auto accident in 1989 at the ripe old age of eighty-nine, long forgotten as a war hero.</p>
                <p>The postwar saga of Tweed was still in the future on July 9, 1944, the day before Tweed’s rescue, when Saipan finally fell to the Americans after three weeks of some of the toughest fighting in the Pacific. The fall of Saipan along with a major defeat of Japanese</p>
                <p>167</p>
                <p>forces in Burma caused a change of government in Japan. Army Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, the hard-line prime minister who had led Japan into the war, resigned, and a new cabinet assumed power as all Japanese commands braced for the next Ameri- can assault.</p>
                <p>As part of General Takashina’s final preparations on Guam to meet the pending U.S. invasion, he is- sued orders on July 10 for all Chamorros through- out the island to be evacuated from their villages and to be marched to campsites in the southern interior of the island. This evacuation was appar- ently for security purposes to keep civilians from interfering with the defense of the island. Over the next few days and nights, long columns of hundreds of people poured out of the villages and marched inland on roads and trails, carrying whatever they could. Some rode carabao carts, but most were on foot, sometimes under air attack and always prod- ded by the bayonets and clubs of Japanese guards. The largest numbers of refugees were herded into camps along the Manengon River inland from Ylig and Yona. Southern villagers were collected mostly at camps inland from Malojloj and Merizo.</p>
                <p>The forced marches to the camps were especially hard on children. Forty years later in an interview, one marcher, Dolores Jones, recalled the ordeal of the 1944 evacuation when she was an orphaned eleven-year-old (her Filipina mother was executed by the Japanese; her Chamorro father was trapped in Manila) who had become the guardian of her small brothers and sisters: “Born in 1941 Joey was three years old. I had him tied on my back, and Lulu, four years old, I was holding her with my right hand. And with my left I was holding my sister who was six years old.... We were walking day and night. I couldn’t keep up with everybody. When I got tired, I would just lay down on the ground and sleep.”</p>
                <p>No buildings, latrines, food, or medicine were provided at the camps. The Japanese troops them- selves were short of supplies and could provide nothing for the Chamorros. The people built palm frond huts, used water from streams, and foraged for anything edible in the jungle. Approximately</p>
                <p>168</p>
                <p>18,000 persons huddled down in squalid conditions in the camps in the heavy daily rains of July to await their fate. Groups of boys and men were taken from the camps from time to time by Japanese guards to work sites and to carry supplies.</p>
                <p>Of those Chamorros who remained or were trapped near the beaches, dozens would be massa- cred by Japanese troops, while others were inadver- tently slaughtered in the American bombardment. The circumstances of many wartime brutalities against Chamorros in this period are unknown, as no eyewitnesses survived. One incomprehensible tragedy was the killing of young Mariquita Perez Howard, the Chamorro wife of an American sail- or on the Penguin. While her sailor husband was a prisoner of war in Japan, she was forced to be the personal servant of the head taicho of the Kaikontai camp at Tai. Beaten and abused, this mother of two little children was last seen being led into the jungle for execution by a Japanese soldier on July 18, just three days before the Americans returned to Guam.</p>
                <p>Her body was never found. Her husband, Ed- ward Neal Howard, returned heartbroken for his little boy and girl after the war, and they were raised in the States. In 1982, the grown son, Chris Perez Howard, would publish a poignant book, Mari- quita: A Guam Story, that concluded in both anger and sadness, “In the war between the United States of America and Japan, the peaceful and hospitable people of Guam were the losers.”</p>
                <p>Some of the most terrible mass executions of Chamorros by the Japanese took place near Merizo just prior to the invasion. On July 15 during a rain- storm, thirty bewildered villagers were herded by Japanese guards into a dugout cave at Tinta, inland from Merizo. The Chamorros did not resist or run away because the Japanese would kill the families of anyone who did so. Inexplicably, the Japanese threw hand grenades into the cave and then bayo- neted and beheaded a number of the Chamorros. Fourteen out of the thirty victims survived by play- ing dead as the Japanese departed to get out of the rain.</p>
                <p>The next day, thirty young Chamorro men of Merizo were selected by the Japanese taicho to dig</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I0</p>
                <p>a trench at a place called Faha near the Merizo cem- etery. As the Chamorros were digging, Japanese guards tossed hand grenades and then machine- gunned the men, killing all thirty. A total of forty-six Chamorros are believed to have died in the Merizo preinvasion massacres. In April 1948 after the war, the dead were memorialized on a bronze plaque on a monument that still stands beside the palm-lined shore in Merizo, another of the many such memori- als to the victims of the numerous wars inflicted on Guam over the centuries</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the 800 or so people of Merizo were assembled and marched inland by the Japa- nese to camps, first at Tingtinghanum for a night, then in the Atate area at Fineli (there were two Fineli camps; the other, now spelled Finile, was near Agat). Some village men among the evacuees learned of the massacres and decided to retaliate. On July 20, with an old Springfield rifle that he had hidden, José (Tonko) Reyes led seven others and killed six Japanese guards at the camp, then attacked Japa- nese soldiers at a small supply depot, killing four more. The surviving Japanese fled into the jungle, leaving Merizo the first village on Guam to be liber- ated and the only one liberated by the Chamorros themselves.</p>
                <p>That night, fearing that the Japanese might return in force, Jesus Cruz Barcinas (who had been one of Laura Thompson’s assistants in 1938) and five of the Merizo men paddled a canoe to Cocos Island to contact American ships. They found the little island deserted but covered with dummy cannons of logs. At daybreak, they paddled beyond the reef and were picked up by an American ship. These brave men assisted in the U.S. invasion as scouts and guides.</p>
                <p>The American bombardment eroded Japanese discipline to a point where the behavior of many Japanese policemen and soldiers degenerated into a kind of destructive nihilism. In Agana on the night of July 20, eleven Chamorro men, women, and young children—all accused of signaling U.S. air- craft—were bayoneted to death. Two teenagers— Juan (Bindan) Cabrera and Beatrice (Belok) Flores Perez—escaped beheading in Agana by faking death but bore lifelong scars from their wounds. At a cave</p>

                <p>near Fena, the taicho of the Agat police substation allowed his men to rape a dozen or so Chamorro girls during July 20-22, and the Japanese then killed a number of the girls as the Americans advanced on the area, according to one survivor, Agnes Sucaldito of Agat. Chamorro men were also killed in a massa- cre in another Fena cave at about the same time. A total of thirty-five Chamorros are believed to have been slaughtered in the Fena caves.</p>

                <p>The American assault gathered momentum af- ter July 18 to become by the morning of July 21, 1944, the most intense crescendo of conventional firepower inflicted on any locality in the Pacific war to date. On that date, W-Day, the island once more experienced an invasion by the Americans, this time in a shattering apocalypse of death and destruction that far surpassed the Spanish invasion in the sev- enteenth century or the Japanese invasion of 1941.</p>

                <p>Liberation as Apocalypse</p>
                <p>The American plan for the assault on Guam in 1944 resembled the Japanese invasion of the island in 1941 but differed in sheer massiveness and in the precise beaches where landings took place. One major U.S. force—the Third Marine Division un- der Major General Allen H. Turnage—would land northeast of Apra Harbor at Asan. The second ma- jor force—the First Provisional Marine Brigade led by Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd and, as a reserve, the Seventy-seventh U.S. Army Infantry (“Statue of Liberty”) Division under Major General Andrew D. Bruce—would land south of Apra Har- bor at Agat, just as the Japanese had done.</p>
                <p>Together, the two U.S. forces made up the II] Am- phibious Corps, which once ashore would come un- der Major General Roy S. Geiger of the U.S. Marine Corps. Geiger—unlike some Marine Corps com- manders—was a quiet man who worked smooth- ly with his army and navy compatriots. After the beachheads were established, the two forces were to converge to pinch off Apra Harbor behind a Force Beachhead Line, or FBL. With the harbor and Orote airstrip in American hands, the combined army and marine forces would push out to occupy the rest of the island.</p>
                <p>The American commanders knew the Japanese order of battle and unit strengths on Guam from documents of the Thirty-first Japanese Army head-</p>

                <p>quarters captured on Saipan. The Japanese com- manders, in contrast, did not know what they faced on the American side. The main opposing ground units were as outlined in Table 1.</p>
                <p>The Americans thus had a three-to-one superi- ority in numbers. The Japanese actually numbered about 20,800, but over 3,000 of these were in sup- port or construction battalions, not combat units.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the total of effective Japanese troops declined significantly by W-Day as hundreds of men died or suffered wounds in the intensive preinvasion bombardment by the Americans since April. From April until the invasion, the Japanese cremated their dead every day, and the stench pervaded the island.</p>
                <p>The W-Day landings were preceded by U.S. Navy underwater demolition teams (UDTs), which blew up reef and lagoon obstacles off the Agat and Asan beaches. On July 20, the UDTs reported “the assault beaches cleared of obstructions.” The next morn- ing, the final bombardment began before dawn at the military time of 0530 hours. This crescendo of firepower lasted for three deadly hours. A Japanese defender, machine-gunner Masashi Ito, described the effect: “The din robbed us totally of all sense of hear- ing. It wasn’t the same as a boom or a roar that splits the ears: it was more like being imprisoned inside a huge metal drum that was incessantly and insuffer- ably being beaten with a thousand iron hammers.”</p>
                <p>Pinned inside their caves and bunkers, the Japa- nese at first could not see the enormous U.S. fleet of eleven battleships, twenty-four aircraft carriers, and 390 other ships that massed off Guam’s western shore. At 0806 hours, the first U.S. armored land- ing craft of the Third Marine Division crossed the line of departure 1,000 yards offshore of Asan. The landing craft were manned by men of the U.S. Coast Guard. At 0828, the first armored amphibious vehi- cles (LTVs) crunched up on Asan Beach, which was divided into four segments—Blue, Green, and Red 1 and 2—between Asan and Adelup points.</p>
                <p>The Ninth Marine Regiment hit Blue Beach on the right flank nearest Asan Point, the Twenty-first Regiment splashed ashore on Green Beach in the center, and the Third landed at Red 1 and 2 near Adelup on the left flank. The air and ship bombard- ment shifted inland as the U.S. Marines charged over the beaches.</p>
                <p>Five miles to the south, the Twenty-second Ma- rine Regimental Combat Team (RCT) of the First Brigade landed at Agat on Yellow Beaches 1 and 2 north of Gaan Point at 0832 hours, as the Fourth RCT assaulted White Beaches 1 and 2 south of Gaan Point. The 305th Infantry Regiment of the ar-</p>

                <p>my’s Seventy-seventh Division followed after some delay (the U.S. Army did not have LTVs, as did the U.S. Marines) to occupy White Beach south of Gaan Point where the Agat cemetery stands.</p>
                <p>Despite the bombardment, the Japanese emerged from their bunkers to fight. At Agat, a seventy-five- millimeter gun and a thirty-seven-millimeter gun mounted in a concrete blockhouse at Gaan Point killed seventy-five marines in the first wave before they even reached Yellow Beach 2. Subsequent waves of marines overran the blockhouse and killed all the defenders.</p>
                <p>At the other beachhead in Asan, Second Lieuten- ant Yasuhiro Yamashita of the Eighteenth Regi- ment described the Asan landing from a hill above Piti: “AIl over, bodies were being blown up as the cannon shells fell. The earth and sand buried the soldiers. There was a lack of manpower, weapon power, and a weak first line defense unit. On the op- posite side the Americans were landing on the beach and they were equipped to annihilate their oppo- nents completely.”</p>
                <p>By nightfall on W-Day, the Americans had se- cured the beachheads up to 1,500 yards inland at Asan and over 2,000 yards deep at Agat. Over 25,000 U.S. troops were digging in and bracing for Japanese counterattacks. By the end of the first day, the Americans had a greater mass of men and more firepower ashore than the Japanese possessed to de- fend the entire island.</p>
                <p>That night the Japanese counterattacked both beachheads, with the heaviest assaults at Agat, where Japanese infantry and four light tanks pierced the American left flank on the north of the beachhead. A bazooka man, Marine Private Bruno Oribiletti, who died fighting, destroyed two of the Japanese tanks, and U.S. General Sherman tanks destroyed the other two in repulsing the attack. In the center at Agat, an infantry counterattack, led by the commander of the Thirty-eighth Regiment, Colonel Tsunetaro Suenaga, amounted to a futile suicide charge. The brave but rash Suenaga died by rifle fire.</p>
                <p>On the American right flank at the Agat beach- head, a small hill—called Hill 40 by the Ameri-</p>
                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>cans—was the site of seesaw fighting as each side took and then lost the hill several times. The Ameri- cans finally secured it by the morning of July 22. The counterattacks against the Americans at Agat were piecemeal and failed despite the courageous but foolhardy charges by the Japanese. Wounded Japanese on the battlefield committed suicide rather than surrender.</p>
                <p>On W-Day+1, July 22, the Americans expanded their perimeters by attacking at dawn. At Asan, the Third Marine Regiment on the left flank of the beachhead seized Adelup Point and clawed its way up steep Chorito Cliff and Bundschu Ridge into the teeth of the Japanese defense. The Third finally se- cured edges of the high ground under heavy fire. In the center at Asan, the Twenty-first Marines fought their way up the slopes toward Mount Chachao, while on the right the Ninth Marines pushed to- ward Piti against light resistance. The men of the Twenty-first and Ninth regiments then settled into a relatively comfortable defense for the night. How- ever, the night of July 22-23 for the Third Marines on Chorito Cliff turned into a nightmare when they had to repel a ferocious Japanese bayonet charge at midnight.</p>
                <p>At the Agat beachhead on W-Day+1, the Twen- ty-second Marine RCT swung north toward Orote Peninsula, while the Fourth Marine RCT and the 305th Infantry fought up the slopes of Maanot Pass in the area between Mount Alifan on the south and Mount Tenjo to the north. By July 23, the fighting had assumed a pattern in which the Americans at- tacked in daylight hours behind massive artillery and air support, and the Japanese counterattacked under the cover of night with weak artillery and no air support. On July 24, General Takashina learned that the Americans were invading Tinian that morn- ing. The battle for Tinian would last a week with over 8,000 Japanese deaths but only 328 marines killed, a ratio of more than twenty to one. In that battle, the Americans for the first time used a devas- tating new weapon, the napalm bomb, which would also soon be used against Japanese troops on Guam.</p>
                <p>From July 23 to July 25, the First Marine Brigade pressed northward from Agat toward Orote against</p>
                <p>173</p>
                <p>stiffening resistance from the Japanese units forced back into the peninsula. On July 25 in broad day- light, the Japanese clumsily attempted to evacuate some troops by barge across Apra Harbor from Sumay to the Piti area, which was still in Japanese hands. U.S. artillery and air strikes sank the barges, killing many of the troops and leaving others to drown. Meanwhile, the army’s 305th Infantry, now with a sister regiment—the 306th Infantry—along- side, wheeled northeastward from Agat toward Mount Tenjo to link up by the end of the day on July 25 with the Ninth Marines, who were mov- ing south from Asan. Apra Harbor was now cut off from the Japanese on the rest of the island.</p>
                <p>At Asan on the left of the beachhead, the Third Marines swept over what is now Nimitz Hill and fought to the edge of the Fonte Plateau, where Gen- eral Takashina had his headquarters. Japanese maps and documents fell into American hands in the fighting and were translated by special U.S. Japa- nese-language translator teams, whose help proved indispensable. A patrol at Fonte found a Japanese officer’s dispatch case with a map overlay that showed the locations of all Japanese units and head- quarters. This information permitted the Americans to improve their night defenses and to prepare their daytime attacks for the maximum effectiveness, particularly for artillery fire.</p>
                <p>Takashina planned counterattacks for the night of July 25-26 to throw the Americans into the sea at both beachheads. One Japanese attack was to be mounted by the nearly 3,000 Japanese troops on Orote, all now bottled up in mangrove swamps at the neck of the peninsula and with cliffs and the ocean to their rear. Sake, beer, and anything else alcoholic were all served liberally to the Japanese troops prior to the Orote counterattack. Just before midnight the drunken Japanese, led by officers wav- ing swords, hurled themselves out of the mangrove swamps at the American lines without a preliminary artillery barrage.</p>
                <p>The Americans shot hundreds of white star shells and other flares into the cloudy night sky to illu- minate the Japanese. Fire from American artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons slaughtered most</p>

                <p>of the attackers. The marines dragged seventy-five- millimeter pack howitzers to within fifty yards of the lines to blast point-blank into the hordes of drunken cannon fodder. Those Japanese who reached the marine foxholes died in bloody man-to- man combat.</p>
                <p>While the banzai massacre took place on Orote, the Japanese on the high ground above the Asan line rushed down against the marines behind an in- tense mortar and artillery barrage on the American positions. As the Japanese charged, they screamed in English, “Wake up and die, marines!” Japanese suicide squads, with some men carrying TNT packs</p>
                <p>and mines strapped to themselves, penetrated as far as the division field hospital near the beach. A ma- rine said of the hospital fight: “What a sight it was! The walking wounded, bandages and all, are bang- ing away at the Japs. Some of the more seriously wounded men were firing from their beds.”</p>
                <p>Over 3,500 Japanese men died in courageous but useless combat in the night attacks of July 25-26 on the two U.S. beachheads. In the close-in, mur- derous combat that took place on Guam, neither side was inclined to take prisoners. A few Japanese faked surrender and then opened fire or threw gre- nades as Americans approached. The Japanese also</p>

                <p>In the following days, the Americans forces south of Apra Harbor overran Mount Alifan, took Sumay, then took all of the Orote Peninsula. The marines north of Apra pushed across the Fonte Plateau to take the Libugon Hill area against entrenched pock- ets of Japanese, who launched one more company- sized banzai charge. Many Japanese soldiers, even those not wounded, committed suicide, usually by exploding a hand grenade against their stomachs. The marines killed the Japanese island commander, Lieutenant General Takashina, by tank machine- gun fire at Fonte shortly after he had issued orders for a Japanese withdrawal to a new defensive line between Dededo and Barrigada.

                <p>On the afternoon of July 29, W-Day+8, high- ranking American officers came ashore for a solemn little ceremony to raise the American flag at the old Sumay Marine Barracks, now in ruins. Apra Har- bor and the Orote airstrip were in American hands. U.S. naval construction battalions (CBs, known popularly as “Seabees”) swiftly repaired the Orote airstrip, and on July 30 the first American aircraft landed, a Navy TBF-1 Grumman Avenger torpedo- bomber. Thereafter, much of the air support for the Americans operated from Orote while supplies be- gan to pour in through Apra Harbor.</p>
                <p>As supplies built up, the Americans paused to regroup while General Obata moved his mangled Japanese forces to the north. The assault phase of the battle for Guam was over, and it had been won by the Americans.</p>

                <p>The Will to Lose Hard</p>
                <p>American bulldozers scooped out mass graves and buried thousands of Japanese dead. The Japanese also buried their dead, many in unmarked locations now unknown. For decades after the war, the bones of these men would appear unexpectedly when new construction was undertaken on Guam. The Ameri- cans buried their own dead in temporary cemeter- ies, the largest at Pigo, and later disinterred and shipped the bodies to their final resting places in the United States.</p>
                <p>While the American forces paused to regroup, General Geiger sent out patrols from the Seventy- seventh Division to reconnoiter the southern inte- rior of Guam. He wanted to be sure that no large Japanese units might attack his southern flank. By this time, a number of Chamorros had filtered across the American lines, and some volunteered as scouts for the Americans. With Chamorros as guides, the army patrols to the south verified that no major Japanese forces lurked as far as Inarajan and Umatac, but the patrols did not penetrate all the way to Merizo.</p>
                <p>Several hundred Chamorro refugees from Inara- jan and Merizo were still camped inland from Mer- izo among the hills south of Fena and inland from Inarajan. Chamorro men in the camps contacted an American patrol, and together they killed and chased away the Japanese guards. After the patrol departed to report back, about 200 Chamorros from the camps marched toward Merizo in the hope of defending themselves better there.</p>
                <p>When the refugees reached Merizo, which was deserted, they gathered in the village schoolhouse. Soon, a platoon-sized force of Japanese soldiers ap- peared from Inarajan and attacked the refugees in the schoolhouse. In this final Chamorro versus Jap- anese skirmish, about seven Japanese soldiers died, and several Chamorros were killed and wounded, but the remaining Japanese fled.</p>
                <p>While the incidents in the south were occurring, American shelling and air strikes against Japanese- held areas in the north continued unabated. Rear</p>

                <p>Admiral Robert L. Conolly, in charge of the U.S. bombardment and called “Close In” Conolly be- cause of his belief in point-blank fire support, feared that the Japanese might still mount a costly house-to- house defense of Agana as they had done in Saipan’s villages. So the last of the town was destroyed in order to liberate it with minimum American casual- ties. The devastation was described by Don Pascual Artero: “So green in vegetation and so pretty a sight had Guam always been, now it was all burned.”</p>
                <p>On the morning of July 31, the American forces resumed the offensive. By that night they had cut the island in half. As the American soldiers and marines moved forward, they came across more and more Chamorro refugees. The Chamorros were taken in hand by the American civil affairs staff, which set up refugee camps with food, water, medicine, and support personnel at Asan (moved later to Anigua, where the camp grew and spilled into the Pigo Cem- etery) and at Finile just south of the old village of Agat in and around the cemetery.</p>
                <p>When army patrols reached the edge of the con- centration camps in the Manengon Valley, the Amer- icans handed out C-rations, candy, and cigarettes to the hungry refugees, many of whom promptly suf- fered diarrhea from gorging on chocolate. Thou- sands of Chamorros in the Manengon camps then trekked westward across the center of the island to the American refugee camps at Finile and Asan for food and help.</p>
                <p>The Americans meanwhile set up a transit camp at Manengon for Chamorros from the camps in the far south. By mid-August, an estimated 18,000 Cha- morros, the bulk of the island civilian population, were housed behind U.S. lines in three main refugee camps, which turned into muddy, sprawling shanty towns. Luckily, the civil affairs teams found cach- es of Japanese food and supplies, and some trucks abandoned by the Japanese, to feed and transport the Chamorros until the U.S. military logistical sys- tem was fully established.</p>
                <p>In the drive northward, the Third Marine Divi- sion attacked on the left or western side of the is- land, and the Seventy-seventh Infantry Division was on the right with its flank on the windward coast.</p>

                <p>Where the island widened above Dededo, the First Provisional Marine Brigade moved up to the left of the Third Marine Division so that all three major U.S. combat units moved abreast to the north. The army’s Seventy-seventh Infantry Division ran into the hardest fighting around Mount Barrigada and at Mount Santa Rosa, while the marines were held up briefly near Finegayan. Small but bloody tank- infantry battles erupted at each location.</p>
                <p>In their advance, the Americans also came across gruesome scenes of Japanese atrocities inflicted ear- lier on Chamorros. A marine patrol found thirty dead Chamorros in and around a Japanese army</p>
                <p>truck north of Yigo. Near the same area, another patrol stumbled onto twenty-one more bodies. Ma- rine Private Joe Young described the dead Chamor- ros to a combat correspondent, Alvin Josephy, Jr., who wrote a dramatic account, The Long, the Short, and the Tall, of the Third Marine Division battles: “They lay in awkward positions—on their sides and their stomachs, and on their knees—like swollen, purple lumps. And none of them had heads, they had all been decapitated. The heads lay like bowling balls all over the place.”</p>
                <p>The dead were young people taken by the Japa- nese from the concentration camps for labor gangs</p>

                <p>to carry ammunition and supplies to the north. The Japanese killed the Chamorros to prevent them from providing information to the advancing Americans. The atrocities made the American soldiers and ma- rines, and their Chamorro scouts, even less inclined to take any prisoners.</p>
                <p>As the Japanese units retreated northward, they were accompanied by their own civilians—Japanese, Koreans, and Okinawans with women and children and elderly men—all fleeing presumed death at the hands of the feared American marines and soldiers. These bewildered refugees included nisei and part- Chamorro, part-Japanese residents of prewar Guam such as members of the Takano, Onedera, Sawada, and Shimizu families.</p>
                <p>According to Naoe Takano, she rarely walked more than fifty paces in Yigo without finding bodies of Japanese soldiers strewn along the path. Once, she recalled, “I felt a hand grab my leg. When I looked down, I saw and heard a dying soldier crying for water. But there was no water.” She walked on.</p>
                <p>When the group that included Naoe as well as Mrs. Kaneki Sawada and Mrs. Reji Dejima reached the high cliffs above Pati Point, they were informed that the next morning they must all jump off the cliffs in a mass suicide. This mass hara-kiri on Guam was to be a repetition of the hundreds of Jap- anese suicides off the cliffs of Saipan back on July 9, when the Americans pushed to Marpi Point on the northern tip of that island. Fortunately, on Guam the Americans bombarded the Pati Point cliff line before the order to jump was given, and the refugees scattered, canceling the mass suicide.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, individual Japanese civilians on Guam did kill themselves out of fear of the Ameri- cans. Some Japanese civilians simply disappeared, presumably killed in the whirlpool of war that swirled around them. Among the old-time residents who died in the retreat to the north were Mrs. Kane- ki Sawada and the elderly José Shimizu, a doyen of Japanese merchants on Guam since the early 1900s. José Shimizu’s descendants would endure and make their family name one of the most respected on Guam in the long years of healing between Japanese and Chamorros after the war.</p>
                <p>179</p>
                <p>Eventually, the Japanese civilian survivors, includ- ing those from Saipan and Rota, fell into American hands in the Yigo area. Some civilians, including Chamorros married to Japanese, were interned with prisoners of war in a stockade at Agana Heights. Most were eventually deported or released, while a few had to face trials.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the U.S. forces pressed relent- lessly northward. In August, the Americans formal- ly reactivated the Insular Patrol and then changed its name to the Local Security Patrol Force, or Com- bat Patrol, as it was popularly known, made up of Chamorro scouts. This new force performed val- iantly in locating Japanese troops and equipment. The U.S. forces also utilized K-9 dog platoons of German shepherds and Doberman pinschers. The dogs proved extremely effective as sentinels, scouts, and ammunition carriers. After the war, a grateful United States created near Yigo a “War Dog Cem- etery,” with the graves of twenty-four dogs killed in action.</p>
                <p>The last clashes between major units on Guam took place August 9-10 along trails leading to the high ground above Tarague Beach. American pa- trols reached the cliffs above Tarague on August 10, completing the drive to the north. When General Geiger learned of this action, he announced that all organized resistance by the Japanese was at an end on Guam. Late that afternoon, Admiral Nimitz landed on Orote airfield with his staff officers and with Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift, the commandant of the Marine Corps. The next day, they met with senior officers of III Amphibious Corps to plan the next phase of operations. Nim- itz also held a press conference at which he read a letter to him from six prominent Chamorros, who wrote, “We rejoice (at) the recapture of Guam and are extremely grateful for the timely relief we are now getting.”</p>
                <p>Geiger established an “enemy straggler line” across the north of the island between Fadian Point and Two Lovers Point. All stragglers were to be con- tained north of this line and mopped up. Geiger’s action proved to be premature. Organized groups of Japanese remained stubbornly active in the north</p>
                <p>180</p>
                <p>and south of the island despite the straggler line, and one final battle took place on Guam. On Au- gust 10, soldiers of the 306th Infantry Regiment came across a large brush-covered hollow—actually a natural limestone sinkhole—at Mataguac Spring near Mount Mataguac just north of Yigo. Unknown to the American soldiers at the time, this depression concealed a fortified cave-bunker, the last command post of Lieutenant General Obata.</p>
                <p>In the fight that followed it took many pole charges and hand grenades plus several 400-pound blocks of TNT to seal up the entrances to the cave- bunker. Eight Americans were killed and seven- teen wounded in the action. When the Americans opened the entrances four days later, they found sixty Japanese bodies inside, among them Obata’s. During the battle, Obata had sent out a last radio message to Imperial Headquarters in Japan: “We have only our bare hands to fight with. The hold- ing of Guam has become hopeless....I am over- whelmed with sorrow for the families of the many fallen officers and men....I pray for the prosperity of the Empire.”</p>
                <p>Tokyo acknowledged the fall of Guam by desig- nating the brave Japanese garrison there as a gyoku- sai (a crushed jewel), meaning a hallowed death with honor for all Japanese on the island who ended their lives in battle.</p>
                <p>Guam was turned over to a U.S. Island Com- mand, whose main mission was to provide support for the next operations in the Pacific war. So ended the Battle of Guam in 1944, but not the fighting on the island, for many defiant Japanese soldiers re- mained in the island’s jungles.</p>
                <p>A total of 1,769 Americans died in the Battle of Guam. The number of Chamorros and other civil- ians killed as a consequence of the war is not pre- cisely known. Formal claims submitted to the U.S. Congress for Chamorro war deaths and injuries documented or witnessed from December 8, 1941, to August 31, 1944, came to 578, of which 320 were for deaths and 258 for injuries, but there were additional deaths and injuries unaccounted for and for which no claims were submitted. In the mid-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II</p>
                <p>1990s a large, impressive Memorial Wall, with all the names of the local people known to have died in the war, would be erected at the Asan Bay Over- look with funding provided by the U.S. Congress in honor of their sacrifices. No such memorial lists the many courageous Japanese soldiers who died hon- orably but uselessly on Guam in carrying out their orders.</p>
                <p>American military records reported 18,377 Japa- nese dead as of the end of August, of whom about 200 were civilians. Only 1,250 Japanese had surren- dered. In the following weeks, the jungles of Guam became a killing ground as American-Chamor- ro hunter teams tracked down Japanese holdouts. Many of the holdouts depended on the munificence of American garbage dumps for food. By the end of September 1944, some 4,926 Japanese holdouts would be killed in spite of U.S. leaflets and broad- casts that induced a few to surrender.</p>
                <p>During the early months of 1945, a compa- ny-sized group of Japanese holdouts under Lieu- tenant Colonel Hideyuki Takeda near Tarague continued to evade capture. As the highest-ranking Japanese officer left alive, Takeda ordered all Japa- nese holdouts to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Americans.</p>
                <p>After the war ended, and in response to American calls to surrender, Takeda himself and sixty-seven of his men finally gave up in September 1945. A week later, he persuaded another forty-six of his men to come in. These prisoners were returned to Japan. From then on, about 130 Japanese, either as indi- viduals or in small groups, held out, utterly con- vinced that American propaganda about the war’s end was a lie.</p>
                <p>These hunted men led desperate lives, a few starving to death and some resorting to cannibal- ism among themselves to survive. During the next decades, 114 stragglers surrendered, and the others were killed, until Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi, the last straggler, surrendered in January 1972, an incred- ible twenty-six and a half years after the war ended. An American military assessment of the Japanese defense of Guam characterized it as “suicidal brav- ery and inhuman tenacity—the will to lose hard.”</p>
                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>Old Aliens, New Methods</p>
                <p>The Americans did not slow the tempo of their ac- tivities once large-unit combat ceased in the Mari- anas in August 1944. All commands immediately prepared for the next major operations in the Pacif- ic. Guam, Saipan, and Tinian had been seized by the United States for three strategic purposes: (1) to lure out the Japanese fleet and defeat it in a decisive bat- tle that would leave open the ocean to invade Palau, the Philippines, Formosa, Okinawa, and eventually Japan itself; (2) to establish forward naval bases— principally at Apra Harbor—that would support those invasions; and (3) to construct air bases from which B-29s—nicknamed “Superfortresses” and called VHBs, or very heavy bombers—could bomb the Japanese home islands.</p>
                <p>The first goal was fulfilled in June 1944, when the U.S. Fifth Fleet defeated the main Japanese Com- bined Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. That left the last two goals, over which the army and the navy would argue. For the navy, which had opera- tional control of the Pacific theater under Admiral Nimitz, the second goal had priority because the navy planned next to invade Peleliu and Angaur in Palau, Ulithi Atoll near Yap, and then the Philip- pines and Formosa.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Army Air Force, however, believed that the third objective should take priority. The air force chief of staff, General Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, intended to make the Marianas into unsinkable air- craft carriers from which the Twenty-first Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force could mount massive air strikes against Japan. The Twenty-first Bomber Command was made up of five wings with over 500 B-29s under the command of Major Gen- eral Curtis LeMay, who believed that the air assault might even make an invasion of the Japanese home islands unnecessary.</p>
                <p>A preinvasion aerial survey of the Marianas in May 1944 by Air Force Major General Walter H. Frank proposed five B-29 air bases on the islands: two on Guam, two on Tinian, and one on Saipan. Rota, small and mesa shaped, was not needed as an air base and therefore was not invaded. Each VHB</p>
                <p>181</p>
                <p>base was to have two 8,500-foot asphalt runways and would house a wing of about 100 B-29s. Each bomber required eighty-five men as support person- nel, of whom eleven were crew. Thus, the air force planned to have over 45,000 men in the Marian- as. One of the fields planned on Guam was Tiyan, which by 1944 had a 6,000-foot runway construct- ed by the Japanese.</p>
                <p>With regard to American strategic planning, Guam was not invaded just to liberate the island because it was a U.S. territory, despite propaganda to that effect in the news media. Although political considerations played a role in the decision to retake Guam, the major factor was to fulfill U.S. strategic military objectives. The key to achievement of those objectives was the seizure of Saipan first in order to cut off Tinian and Guam from Japanese reinforce- ments and supplies and thus make the two latter islands more vulnerable to assault. From the strate- gic viewpoint, the Battle of Saipan, not the Battle of Guam, was the most decisive in the three invasions of the Marianas in 1944.</p>
                <p>Civil matters nonetheless had to be taken into ac- count. Back in March 1944, Nimitz created a spe- cial headquarters called Forward Area Pacific Com- mand headed by Vice Admiral John H. Hoover. This officer, a “dour and ill-humored” man ac- cording to a naval historian, was given responsibil- ity for the islands of the central Pacific after they were conquered by U.S. forces. In March, Hoover assumed authority in the liberated Marshall-Gilbert islands, and, in July, his responsibility shifted to the Mariana Islands. Hoover’s title then became Com- mander Marianas Area. In 1948, this title changed to Commander U.S. Naval Forces Marianas (COM- NAVMAR). Over the years following World War I], COMNAVMAR would become the senior U.S. military post for all Micronesia under CINCPAC in Hawai‘1.</p>
                <p>To reestablish the navy’s authority on Guam after the invasion, Admiral Nimitz had issued a procla- mation on invasion day, July 21, 1944, which was designated as Liberation Day. The proclamation established the island’s government until 1950. In</p>

                <p>CHAPTER II</p>
                <p>U.S. military commanders on Guam, December 1944. From left to right: Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, USN (in front seat), Commander and Chief Pacific and Commander in Chief Pacific Area (CINCPAC-CINCPOA); Rear Admiral Forrest B. Sherman, USN, of Nimitz’s staff; Vice Admiral J. H. Hoover, USN, Commander Marianas Area; and Major General Henry L. Larsen, USMC, Island Commander (in effect governor) of Guam, 1944-1946. (From the collection</p>
                <p>of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>the Yo, el Rey, style of the Spanish kings, and of Captain Richard Leary back in 1899 and of Gen- eral Horii in 1941, Nimitz asserted, “All powers of government and jurisdiction in Guam and adjacent waters, and over the inhabitants thereof, and final administrative responsibility are vested in me as Ad- miral, United States Navy, commanding the forces of occupation and as Military Governor, and will be exercised through subordinate commanders by my direction....No political activity will be permit-</p>
                <p>ted other than that authorized by me or under my authority.”</p>
                <p>As each island in the Marianas was occupied by the Americans, the first need of the navy was to ac- quire huge tracts of land, particularly around the harbors and at the sites of the planned airfields. Ini- tially, the U.S. forces simply confiscated whatever land was needed and worried later about ownership and eminent domain procedures. Such expropria- tion posed no problems on Saipan and Tinian, both</p>
                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>enemy islands. On Guam, a U.S. territory, formal legal acquisition of property by negotiated lease or purchase, or by condemnation, would eventually be required. In the meantime, and in some cases for several more years, the military paid nothing for much of the private land that it occupied on Guam, either as rent or in purchase.</p>
                <p>Admiral Hoover first expropriated Orote Penin- sula and all other property in and around Apra Har- bor, including the village of Sumay, whose inhabi- tants remained in refugee camps for the time being. Hoover then placed top priority on the construction of a permanent, multilane express highway, later named Marine Drive, from Apra Harbor to the sites for airfields in the north and center of the island and for naval facilities. With the navy moving ahead on its own projects, Air Force Lieutenant General Mil- lard E Harmon arrived on Guam in August to co- ordinate with the navy and prepare for construction of the B-29 bases. To the astonishment of the air force officers, the navy had taken over Tiyan airfield to make it into the U.S. Naval Air Station (NAS), not a B-29 airfield.</p>
                <p>Since the navy had operational control of the Marianas, the air force officers swallowed their an- ger over Tiyan and altered their plans. They decided first to construct the support base at Depot Field (later renamed in memory of General Harmon after he was lost at sea on a B-24 flight from Guam to Hawai‘i in 1946). Depot Field was to be completed in November 1944 to be followed by completion of Northwest Field near Mount Machanao and then North Field (later named after Brigadier General James R. Andersen, who was lost on the same flight as Harmon) at Upi. General Harmon departed with the understanding that Seabees would be put to work promptly on the air force bases to help the army engineer battalions.</p>
                <p>The land for the B-29 bases was expropriated, but the Seabees remained assigned to the navy’s projects as first priority. They cut through Chorito Cliff near the beach at Asan and bulldozed sections of Piti and Agana along the beaches to make way for Marine Drive, regardless of private property lines. There did not appear to be any thought-out plan for re-</p>
                <p>183</p>
                <p>building Guam by the military at this stage in the is- land’s reoccupation. Japanese fortifications of thick cement were left in place and remain today along Guam’s shores as subjects for endless photographs by Japanese tourists.</p>
                <p>The U.S. dozers pushed tons of wrecked tanks, trucks, jeeps, weapons, and other junk as well as garbage from military camps into huge dumps and off cliffs into the ocean. One dumping spot for de- bris and garbage at Apuntua Point on Orote Pen- insula became known as the Shark Pit, owing to the swarms of sharks attracted to the spills. Today, the ocean bottom below the cliff at Apuntua and in deeper waters off Orote is still covered with a mantle of old metal and empty fifty-five-gallon oil drums.</p>
                <p>The frenetic U.S. military construction included a channel dredged into Apra’s inner harbor, the old caldera chica, for a ship repair facility and subma- rine base. Old Fort Santa Cruz, on which Captain Glass had claimed Guam in 1898, was demolished to make way for the channel. The Seabees also com- pleted new buildings on Nimitz Hill above Asan for the advance headquarters of the Pacific Fleet plus a Flag Circle of living quarters for high naval officers. Portions of this land were private property, but the navy did not pay rent at the time, which would re- sult in considerable later criticism. Admiral Nimitz moved into this headquarters in February 1945.</p>
                <p>Large cantonment areas for troop camps, supply warehouses, and ammunition and fuel depots began to materialize on Guam. Buildings were predomi- nantly semicircular Quonset huts of corrugated tin sheeting. The Americans surfaced the main roads and airfield runways with asphalt made from bi- tuminous materials mixed with limestone cascajo. Excavation of the limestone left numerous quarries, which remain today, great empty pits on some of the most expensive real estate on the island. Because limestone contains millions of tiny organic shell fragments of ancient mollusks, algae readily grows on asphalt in Guam’s moist, humid climate. The al- gae becomes slick when wet. Thus, for decades af- ter World War II, Guam’s black-topped roads were treacherously slippery in the slightest rain, causing innumerable accidents.</p>
                <p>184</p>
                <p>The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), may have been first introduced to Guam in this period as an accidental passenger in the thousands of U.S. military vehicles and tons of supplies shipped from storage depots on Manus in the Admiralty Islands north of Papua New Guinea, where the snakes are indigenous. Like most other introduced life forms, this snake would gradually become highly destruc- tive of indigenous birds and animals, plus it would add to Guam’s recurring electric power problems by climbing into transformers and shorting them out.</p>
                <p>Air force personnel began arriving in large numbers on Guam, but to their dismay they discovered that the navy had given low priority to the construction of B-29 bases. On Saipan and Tinian, where con- struction of airfields started promptly and earlier than on Guam, and where the chain of command was leaner, the B-29 air bases were operational in October and December, respectively. In November 1944, 111 B-29s flew from Isley Field, Saipan, in the first high-altitude daylight raid against Tokyo.</p>
                <p>From then on, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C., gave the B-29 missions priority in the Pacific war. As a consequence, the navy’s plan to invade Formosa was canceled, but the invasions of Peleliu and Anguar, which in retrospect probably should not have taken place, went ahead in Septem- ber 1944 with severe toll in the lives of U.S. Marines. Admiral Nimitz and his commanders then focused on the assault against the Philippines, which began in October 1944, when General MacArthur’s forces invaded Leyte. The invasion provoked the last of the Japanese Combined Fleet into a confrontation on October 22-25 with the U.S. Third and Seventh fleets in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the greatest na- val clash in history. This gigantic encounter ended in disastrous defeat for the Japanese despite their use of kamikaze suicide air attacks in large numbers against the Americans for the first time.</p>
                <p>Because of the navy’s preoccupation with these huge naval operations, construction of the B-29 bas- es on Guam lagged. Not a shy man, General LeMay commented caustically on Guam’s navy command- ers: “They had built tennis courts for the Island</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II</p>
                <p>Commander; they had built fleet recreation centers, a Marine rehabilitation center, dockage facilities for inter-island surface craft, and every other damn thing in the world except subscribing to the original purpose in the occupation of those islands.”</p>
                <p>In February 1945, the first B-29 bombing mission from Guam finally took off from the still incom- plete Northwest Field. The same month, the Third Marine Division was ordered to leave its camps at Yona to help the Fourth and Fifth Marine divisions seize the tiny island of Iwo Jima halfway between the Marianas and Japan. The U.S. Air Force wanted to eliminate the Japanese fighter planes that used Iwo’s airstrip to intercept B-29s en route to and from Japan, and the strip was needed as an emer- gency B-29 landing site to avoid ocean ditching by bombers crippled on their missions. From Iwo Jima, U.S. fighters could also escort B-29s to Japan as protection against Japanese home-based fighters.</p>
                <p>After the Iwo Jima airstrip was in U.S. hands in early March (and 2,300 wounded marines from the battle were in Guam’s Naval Hospital), LeMay switched to low-level fire-bombings of Japan’s cit- ies. On the night of March 9 it took two hours for over 300 B-29s to take off from Guam, Tinian, and Saipan on the first mass incendiary bomb mission. Eight hours later, nearly 100,000 Japanese lay in- cinerated among mammoth fires that consumed six- teen square miles of Tokyo. The mission was judged a success, despite the loss of fourteen B-29s and their crews.</p>
                <p>In the following weeks, waves of B-29s fire- bombed the great cities of Japan into ruins. It took a grueling fifteen hours for the trip to and from Tokyo by the bombers. The B-29s also seeded the Japanese coastal waters with thousands of mines to choke off interisland maritime traffic. Each day, the roar of bombers filled the skies over Guam as the tempo of the strategic air war increased. Each night, giant searchlights shot fixed vertical shafts of light into the skies of the Marianas as beacons to guide the Superfortresses back to their island bases like the Spanish bonfires centuries before on Ritidian Point and Rota to guide the Acapulco galleons to safe landing.</p>
                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>Under LeMay’s prodding, North Field’s first run- way was completed in June 1945 and the second in July just before the war ended. LeMay’s headquar- ters, barracks, mess halls, storage areas, and clubs spread along the bluff above Tumon Bay all the way to Two Lovers Point, where an officers’ club was constructed. The entire north of the island from Pati Point to Ritidian Point became a gigantic military complex around North and Northwest Fields and navy communications facilities.</p>
                <p>One long-term adverse effect (among several such) of military construction was the elimination of many trees indigenous to the limestone forest of the northern plateau of Guam. In particular, the tall, beautiful ifil and serianthes trees posed haz- ards to aircraft landings and takeoffs and so were cut down. Military bulldozers piled brush into huge piles, which were burned, blanketing Guam with smoke for weeks from the great bonfires. Ifil’s hard, dense wood is fire resistant and not amenable to use as frame lumber, so great trunks of the trees lay in the jungles for years around the air bases. Because ifil and serianthes trees are slow growing, they never made a full comeback on Guam. Today they are scarce.</p>
                <p>Endings and Beginnings</p>
                <p>While the air war against Japan gathered momen- tum, civil affairs on Guam moved slowly toward a more normal life for the Chamorros, but it was to be a new manner of living, not the old prewar ways. In October 1944, the civil affairs unit was upgraded to become the “Military Government of Guam” under Major General Henry L. Larsen, USMC, with ten departments responsible for executive func- tions (education, labor, public health, and so forth) similar to the prewar naval government. Changes in governmental organization, laws, policies, and regulations were by proclamation.</p>
                <p>It was in the period 1944-1946 that the ethni- cally neutral word “Guamanians” came into use to describe all residents of Guam, regardless of ethnici- ty but usually meaning people of Chamorro descent since they were a large majority of the population.</p>
                <p>185</p>
                <p>Prior to World War II, the Americans referred to the indigenous people of Guam variously as Chamor- ros, “natives,” and Guamanians. During the Mari- anas campaign in World War II, the U.S. press and military personnel had to differentiate between the Chamorros on Saipan and those on Guam. This was done by referring to them as Saipanese and Guama- nians. After the war as a result of informal polls in 1946, the island public chose “Guamanians” over “Chamorros” and other names such as “Guamese” or “Guamians” as the generally preferred term.</p>
                <p>Americans from the forty-eight states were (and still are) usually called “mainlanders” or “statesid- ers” in public. Privately, locals sometimes called white people “Anglos” (a Spanish term) or “haoles” (a Hawaiian term). Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, the word “Guamanians” for all locals would be generally discarded and replaced again by “Filipi- nos” or “Chamorros” after Chamorro-rights advo- cates campaigned to eliminate “Guamanians” as a colonialist term even though by then people of Cha- morro descent were a plurality, not a majority, of the island population.</p>
                <p>After the invasion, food was provided free to all Chamorros by the military government through a rationing system until the war ended. One of the principal canned foods provided by the navy in this period was Spam. This processed meat became so extraordinarily popular with Chamorros that it was called “Chamorro steak” and is still immensely popular on Guam today. It was also in this period that Tabasco hot sauce from Louisiana became a fa- vorite of Guamanians.</p>
                <p>Some Chamorros objected to being held in the refugee camps. Villagers from the south, where damage to housing was the least, were the first to return to their homes. Other Chamorros decided not to wait to be relocated. Led by Simon A. San- chez, a small group of families left the Anigua refu- gee camp in late August 1944 and moved to land of the Lujan (Kapili) family just below the Jalaguac cliff in the old Dededo area. The military authorities tried to move them back, and the civil affairs com- mander cut off food rations to them. A Catholic na- val chaplain, Commander Patrick Gerrity, arranged</p>
                <p>186</p>
                <p>to provide food to the Chamorros from nearby Sea- bee kitchens and stores. With Seabee help, the Cha- morros constructed a wood and canvas community center and school. The stubborn little Chamorro community persevered and grew to become the cen- ter of the postwar municipality of Tamuning.</p>
                <p>The massive influx of U.S. military personnel into Guam brought American racial problems to the is- land. In World War II, U.S. servicemen were segre- gated into white and black units, with most blacks in support and logistical elements. When black sail- ors from the naval supply depot at Apra Harbor be- gan to date Chamorro women in island bars, fights erupted between white marines and the black sail- ors. Racial animosity among the Americans led to shootings and a serious race riot on December 24, 1944. A navy court of inquiry on the riot blandly concluded, “There is no organized or concerted racial prejudice or discrimination existing on the island of Guam.” The people of Guam knew this conclusion was nonsense. Chamorro women went on dating blacks as well as whites.</p>
                <p>In 1944 and early 1945, the navy often moved groups of Chamorros from one location to another because of military needs, and civilian housing re- mained inadequate. Of the 3,286 dwelling places on Guam prior to the war, about 80 percent had been destroyed. From August 1944 through Sep- tember 1945, the military government constructed over 1,400 dwellings in new communities in Agat, Asan, Santa Rita, Sinajana, Barrigada, new Dededo, Yona, and Talofofo. The Chamorros themselves built about 1,500 houses in the new communities and in prewar villages in the south.</p>
                <p>By mid-1945, about 5,000 Chamorros still re- mained homeless in the refugee camps largely be- cause the navy forbade resettlement of Agana and Sumay. General Larsen and his successors planned to make an Americanized “New Agana” with neat rectangular streets like Santa Monica, California, in place of the crooked lanes of prewar Agana. This plan would never be completed, and it would cause land tenure problems in the years ahead. In the meantime, rubble in the town was cleared, and the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II</p>
                <p>former capital was scraped barren. Debris from Aga- na was piled out from shore near the mouth of the Agana River, which was diverted. This area would be made into a park and renamed the Paseo de Su- sana in 1955 with a small marina on the south side.</p>
                <p>The military government rebuilt and repaired seventeen churches, including two for the Baptists, but, as before the war, the navy was not happy with a Spanish bishop. When Bishop Olano returned to the island in March 1945, Admiral Nimitz arranged through the powerful archbishop of New York, Francis J. Spellman, to have Olano replaced. Spell- man visited Guam in August 1945 and apparently persuaded Olano to resign.</p>
                <p>The Vatican replaced Olano with the Most Rev- erend Apollinaris William Baumgartner, O.EM., an American Franciscan Capuchin, who arrived in Oc- tober. Olano was then pressured to leave, and he sailed in sadness to Manila. Some Spanish priests would be assigned to Guam later on, and Olano himself would later return to die on the island. But, with his departure as bishop in 1945, the Spanish mission on Guam came to an end 277 years after Father San Vitores first stepped ashore at Agana.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the navy’s heavy hand in land, housing, and religious matters at the end of World War II, its efforts in public health were helpful. Eleven civil health stations, one in each village, were established in 1944, and preventive immunization programs against typhoid, diphtheria, and smallpox were implemented. A 300-bed civilian hospital was constructed of sheet-metal Butler buildings between Oka and Saupon Points (which thereafter became jointly known as Hospital Point) next to a huge Na- val Hospital of Quonset huts. Medical treatment of Guamanians by the navy remained generally free, as before the war, between 1944 and 1950. Much of this medical help of civilians also served to pro- tect American military personnel from infections and diseases that might incur among the civilian population.</p>
                <p>In education, the new military government proved much more responsive than the prewar one. The first three elementary schools opened in October 1944 with Chamorro teachers and principals once</p>
                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>more under Simon A. Sanchez as superintendent of schools. Within a year, twenty-one new schools were in operation with 167 Chamorro teachers and over 7,000 students. This student population was larger than the number in school in 1941 even though the total resident population was slightly smaller.</p>
                <p>By the end of the war, 400 business licenses had been issued to Guamanians. Plants to bottle Coca- Cola and Pepsi-Cola began operations; the Johnston family set up their movie theater again, this time in a long Quonset hut in Agana; and the Martinez family reestablished their ice plant and meat market at a new location in Anigua. The Bank of Guam re- opened in 1945 under navy management as the only financial institution permitted on the island. Fast growing in the coming boom years, the bank would open a branch on Saipan in January 1947. A navy report characterized the Bank of Guam as “a finan- cial Gibraltar” but “an administrative peat-bog.”</p>
                <p>The navy encouraged Guamanians to return to farming; in particular, it wanted to revive copra pro- duction. Instead, the locals flocked to salaried jobs with the military and with civilian contractors, who were now being brought in on construction proj- ects. Prior to the war, there had been about 1,200 Chamorro wage earners. By the end of 1946, ap- proximately 6,000 Chamorros were wage earners, with about half of them working for the navy, even though the old prewar double wage standard be- tween locals and stateside hires was reimposed for government positions. The Guam civil service was reinstituted with a forty-hour week, mostly for of- fice positions, which were far more attractive than sweating in the sun for copra.</p>
                <p>Along with the introduction of many more white- collar office jobs for locals on Guam, the military also for the first time installed air-conditioners in of- fices and living quarters. Longer tours of duty for the military on Guam became normal with air-con- ditioned work sites and homes.</p>
                <p>The U.S. military buildup and reconstruction of the island infrastructure caused a heavy demand for workers, so for the first time the women of Guam found salaried jobs open to them as secretaries, clerks, and telephone operators. As a result, the old</p>
                <p>187</p>
                <p>Chamorro custom of families moving to their rural lanchos during weekdays to raise crops and return- ing to their villages or Agana for church and social affairs on the weekends decreased significantly in the postwar period. While family and village fiestas continued to be held and many other neo-Chamorro customs persisted, most Guamanians went to work in offices or construction sites on weekdays and Sat- urday mornings. Some farming for row crops and fruit continued, but copra and rice production for export or local commercial sale ceased after the war.</p>
                <p>While the people of Guam were adapting to new patterns of life in early 1945, in April they were sad- dened by the news that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Georgia. Roosevelt was considered a friend of the island since his days as assistant secretary of the navy in the post-World War I era. In reality, how- ever, he had been a consistent supporter of naval policies that tended to restrict the civil liberties of the people of Guam. However, Roosevelt’s succes- sor—Harry S. Truman—would turn out to be the president most sympathetic in American history to the appeals of the Chamorros.</p>
                <p>The war in the meantime ground on. Germany capitulated in May, and in June Okinawa was de- clared secure under American control. Preparations then began for the allied invasion of the home is- lands of Japan. It was feared by everyone that this last titanic assault would be the bloodiest in history. But it was not to be.</p>
                <p>In February 1945, a naval commander, Frederic L. Ashworth, had unobtrusively visited Admiral Nim- itz on Guam and then inspected the B-29 airfields in the Marianas. The commander was a member of the super secret Manhattan Project, which had de- veloped the atomic bomb. He informed Nimitz for the first time of “a new weapon...covered by the highest order of secrecy” that a special B-29 unit, the 509th Composite Group of the 393d Squadron, would deliver against Japan from the Marianas. Ashworth picked Tinian’s North Field as the base for the 509th. At this point, even General LeMay himself did not know the 509th’s mission.</p>

                <p>RETURN OF THE AMERICANS 1944-1945</p>
                <p>LeMay learned of the mission in June, when Air Force Colonel Paul Tibbets, commanding officer of the 509th, visited LeMay on Guam to arrange for a special compound on Tinian for his unit. In early July, the 509th’s fifteen B-29s flew into Tinian. They soon began practice bombing runs over Rota, drop- ping high explosive bombs on the hapless Japanese and Chamorros trapped and beginning to starve on the island. In mid-July, three special aircraft landed at the Naval Air Station on Guam with components for the new bombs, which were then assembled in secret and flown to Tinian. In July, the cruiser USS Indianapolis delivered to Tinian the atomic material for the warheads. The Indianapolis then steamed alone for the Philippines. En route the cruiser was sunk by a Japanese submarine, and some 800 men died by drowning and shark attacks. This event would have been cataclysmic, not just tragic, had it occurred a week earlier when the cruiser had fis- sionable material aboard.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Twentieth Air Force commander, General Carl Spaatz, met with LeMay, Tibbets, and other officers in July at LeMay’s Twenty-first Bomb- er Command headquarters on the Harmon Cliffline to read a fateful order for the 509th “to deliver its first special bomb...after about 3 August 1945 on one of the targets: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki.” On August 6 at precisely 8:15:17 a.m., a B-29 named the Enola Gay after Tibbets’ mother, with Tibbets at the controls, dropped the world’s first atomic fission bomb, Little Boy, over the city of Hiroshima. Forty-three seconds later, Little Boy exploded, and a new era began for all humankind.</p>
                <p>The second atomic mission followed on August 9 with a plutonium fusion bomb called Fat Man that</p>
                <p>189</p>
                <p>was dropped on Nagasaki by a 509th B-29 named Bock’s Car piloted by Major Charles Sweeney. Over 78,000 people were killed instantly at Hiroshima and 35,000 at Nagasaki. Thousands more Japanese soon died from radiation, burns, and other effects. On the same day as the Nagasaki bombing, the So- viet Union entered the war against Japan by invad- ing Manchuria.</p>
                <p>On August 15, Emperor Hirohito broadcast to his war-weary subjects Japan’s surrender. World War II ceased on August 21, V-J Day, and, on September 2, 1945, the final terms of the Japanese surrender were signed in Tokyo Bay aboard the battleship USS Missouri. Thus, the B-29s from bases in the Mari- anas did end the war without the need to invade Japan, as LeMay had predicted, but only with a far more powerful weapon than his conventional high- explosive and incendiary bombs.</p>
                <p>In the eyes of American military strategists, this one momentous operation—the atomic bombing of Japan—confirmed the immense strategic value of the Mariana Islands to U.S. national security, a value that far outweighed the costs of subsidizing the residents for the use of their islands. From the military viewpoint, this strategic value not only jus- tified all past sacrifices to seize the Marianas but also impelled the permanent retention of the islands and the occupation of huge tracts of Guam’s land by the United States to meet potential new threats. Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, chief of naval opera- tions during World War II, wrote that the Marianas were “the key to the Pacific War.” And, he might have added, they would be an indispensable asset to the United States in future wars in Asia.</p>

                <p>New Geopolitics, Old Realpolitik</p>
                <p>After V-J Day, the rapid demobilization—called the Magic Carpet Program—of American forces drastically reduced the military presence on Guam. Admiral Nimitz and his CINCPAC staff, includ- ing Vice Admiral Hoover, departed for Hawai‘i in late August 1945, leaving Major General Larsen still island commander. As of August 31, 1945, the military population on the island was an enormous 201,718, and civilians numbered 21,838, for a to- tal of 223,556. With a density of 1,045 persons per square mile, this was the largest number of people on Guam in the island’s history before or since that date. Less than ten months later, by mid-1946, mili- tary personnel numbered only 36,923, a huge re- duction of 82 percent.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Liquidation Commission started auc- tions of surplus military stocks on Guam in January 1946 and in August opened a Surplus Property Sales Store with bargains that provided the basis of sev- eral prosperous local businesses on postwar Guam. Hundreds of Quonset huts, barracks, jeeps, trucks, and assorted other vehicles plus huge amounts of surplus military equipment, weapons, fuels, canned foods, bottled beverages (including beer), and sup- plies were sold cheaply or left behind (with some stocks and munitions buried).</p>
                <p>Military wives and children began to arrive on Guam by mid-1946. In June, the navy opened</p>
                <p>190</p>
                <p>a regular large commissary store, and, by the end of 1946, the navy’s Admiral Nimitz eighteen-hole golf course (for military only) was completed, with 150 acres of it on private land. In September 1946, Pan American (renamed Pan Am after the war) re- opened regular trans-Pacific commercial flights with military C-54s converted to airliners. Pan Am planes landed at the Tiyan Naval Air Station, where a civilian terminal was set up on the opposite side of the runway from the navy’s facilities. All island ac- tivities, however, came to a jolting halt on Septem- ber 21-22, 1946, when a typhoon smashed into the Marianas. Inappropriately called Typhoon Querida (Darling in Spanish), the storm destroyed, among other things, the U.S. Naval Hospital of Quonset huts at Oka—but not the civilian hospital next door made of Butler buildings—as well as 4,000 feet of the breakwater under construction at Apra Harbor. Completion of the breakwater was delayed until June 1947; it was named the Glass Breakwater in honor of Captain Henry Glass.</p>
                <p>Magic Carpet nonetheless continued on, and, by the end of 1946, American forces had vacated vast military camps on Guam. Military personnel by then numbered fewer than 29,000. The downside of the hasty military evacuation in 1945-1946 was that much of the landscape of central and northern Guam was left cluttered with military debris. A jour-</p>

                <p>nalist described postwar Guam: “From the air, it lies on the rim of the western sea like a lump of jade rimmed in silver and blue.... But Guam, from the air or a ship from the ocean sea, is a fantasy.... For Guam is a huge construction camp, rowdy, crude and jerry-built. It is also a vast junk yard and a one- time battlefield where the scars of combat still of- fend the eye everywhere.”</p>
                <p>This war-devastated image of Guam remained a lasting impression for journalists and for thousands of American servicemen who passed through the is- land. For years, Guam would be the butt of jokes in the United States as an uninviting place, where boredom led to “rock fever,” a cranky longing to get off the island. Over the next decades, parts of Guam—particularly Cabras Island, Anigua, and Harmon—remained seedy junkyards. There was no U.S. Marshall Plan for Guam or the Philippines, as there was for former enemies of America in Europe.</p>
                <p>To stop soil erosion from areas where plants had been blasted away in the war, the military reforested the Marianas with a small tree that grows to about fifteen feet. Native to tropical Latin America, it is called tangantangan on Guam—originally named by botanists Leucaena glauca Benth and now Leu- caena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. This quick- growing plant has good nitrogen-fixing ability, is food for cattle, makes good firewood, and provides straight poles for hut and fence supports. A similar but smaller plant, talantayan (Leucaena insularum), is endemic to the Marianas but grows well only near the sea. The Spaniards introduced tangantangan to both Guam and the Philippines, but it was not widespread in the Marianas before 1947. In Octo- ber of that year, tens of thousands of tangantangan seeds were spread from military aircraft all over the Mariana Islands. Today, the trees are everywhere on Guam.</p>
                <p>One unpleasant legal matter left over from the war was the prosecution of Japanese and Chamor- ros accused of war crimes. A special navy war crimes commission (this was a national U.S. military court, unlike the international war crimes commissions at Nuremberg and Tokyo) was set up in Quonset huts at Nimitz Hill for trials from 1944 to 1949</p>
                <p>191</p>
                <p>of 144 prisoners—including fifteen Chamorros from Saipan and Rota and one from Guam—from throughout Micronesia as well as from Guam. The fifty-one cases tried were open to the public, and the press published lurid accounts of cannibalism by Japanese officers and enlisted men who ate the cooked flesh of American prisoners and even fellow Japanese during the war. The most heinous crime was by Captain Hiroshi Iwanami, the commander of the Japanese naval hospital at Truk, charged with killing ten downed American naval pilots through “inhumane experimental use of bacteria, dynamite, and bamboo spears.” Eight of the accused were acquitted, and two committed suicide. Nine death sentences were carried out, all on Guam by hang- ing, among them three admirals and one lieutenant general. Captain Iwanami was one of those hanged.</p>
                <p>Japanese civilian residents of Guam, including Naoe Takano and Antonio Arriola Shimizu (the part-Chamorro son of José Shimizu), were deported to Saipan. Some deportees returned eventually to live on Guam. Among civilians convicted of crimes were the Saipanese police interpreter José P. Villago- mez and the former Agana restaurant owner Samuel Shinohara. The court found Shinohara guilty of treason against the United States even though he was not a U.S. citizen, and he was sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was commuted, and he served eight years in Japan before returning to live out his life unobtrusively on Guam. After all the trials were completed, the court and the stockade in Agana Heights were quietly closed in May 1949.</p>
                <p>While local problems left over from World War II were being sorted out on Guam, the island began to feel the effects of the new world order that emerged from World War II. Delegates of forty-six nations had signed the United Nations Charter in June 1945 in San Francisco. The U.N. Trusteeship Council was then created to oversee the promise of self-determi- nation for eleven trusteeships worldwide. The for- mer Japanese mandate islands of Micronesia were to constitute the eleventh trusteeship.</p>
                <p>American military leaders, however, demanded the retention of Micronesia by the United States for</p>
                <p>192</p>
                <p>national defense purposes. They and their congres- sional supporters argued that Micronesia’s islands were too valuable strategically and had cost too much blood to be given up for idealistic reasons of decolonization. The U.S. Navy supported a bill in the Seventy-ninth Congress (1945-1946) for the United States to annex Micronesia and make Guam the capital of a new American territory with an or- ganic act so that the area could eventually become a U.S. state. The bill died owing to State Department opposition. Instead of annexation, the United States asked for authorization to fortify the trusteeship is- lands in Micronesia and close them to outsiders. To calm proponents of decolonization, Truman prom- ised to take steps to bring about self-determination by the Micronesians.</p>
                <p>This compromise fit the new U.S. military strat- egy of creating an oceanic “base network” rather than depending on a string of bases across the Pa- cific as in the prewar Orange Plans. After visiting Guam and other islands in the region in July 1946, Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal described this strategy: “Single island positions cannot be con- sidered strong bases. Selected islands can, however, together with Guam, form a far-reaching, mutually supporting base network, although alone would fall far short of being an impregnable bastion.”</p>
                <p>The network of oceanic bases was to support a forward deployment of U.S. forces in allied nations around Asia as part of the containment of commu- nism. U.S. control would also deny Micronesia to potential hostile powers such as the Soviet Union, China, and possibly Japan again in the distant fu- ture. The military also wanted to use the isolated atolls of the Marshall Islands to test U.S. nuclear weapons. The United States had already begun atomic tests in July 1946 with the first explosion at Bikini Atoll.</p>
                <p>The Micronesian trusteeship was put under the U.N. Security Council, where the United States has veto power, rather than in the Trusteeship Coun- cil, where a majority vote decides issues. Soviet objections were overcome by a tacit understand- ing whereby the United States acquiesced to Soviet retention of four Japanese islands in the southern</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>Kurils north of Japan, and occupied by the Soviet Union at the war’s end, in return for Soviet agree- ment to American control of Micronesia. The U.N. Security Council approved the unique strategic trusteeship agreement with the United States in 1947, and the U.S. Congress ratified the agreement. The title of the new dependency was the Trust Ter- ritory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). Truman gave control of the trusteeship to the Department of the Navy and appointed CINCPAC, who administered the area from Hawai‘i, as the first high commission- er. The trusteeship did not include Guam, which, as a U.S. Territory, continued to be administered sepa- rately by the navy.</p>
                <p>A year earlier on July 4, 1946, the United States had granted the Philippines independence, and Ma- nila signed a treaty by which the United States as- sumed responsibility for the strategic defense of the new Republic of the Philippines in return for Ameri- can leases of bases at Subic Bay, Clark Field, and elsewhere in the islands. Japan in the meantime had come under the “MacArthur Constitution,” which prohibited Japanese rearmament. The geopolitics of the Pacific were thus transformed from the prewar situation, in which Guam was a lonely American outpost surrounded by Japanese islands, to one in which Guam was an indispensable fortress in an American-dominated lake that encompassed the en- tire Pacific Ocean. From the American viewpoint, the strategic error in 1898 of not claiming for the United States all of Spanish Micronesia, or at least all the Mariana Islands, was at last rectified.</p>
                <p>With the legal basis of American hegemony es- tablished in the area, COMNAVMAR’s main mis- sion in 1947-1950 was to complete permanent fa- cilities on Guam, and for that purpose great chunks of land were needed by the military. In 1947, the National Security Act created a new Department of Defense (headed by James Forrestal), the U.S. Air Force (formerly the Army Air Corps from 1926 to 1941, then the Army Air Force until 1947), as well as the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council (NSC). The National Security Act was supposed to unify the U.S. armed forces but in- stead created quasi-independent military services in</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>which the navy (because of Forrestal’s association with it) emerged with the most influence.</p>
                <p>With a free hand, the U.S. Navy implemented what critics called a “zoo policy” of keeping the TTPI isolated and undeveloped like an exotic an- thropological park in order to deny it to any po- tential rivals. This militarized Pax Americana would transform Guam into a small but highly valuable U.S. Gibraltar of the Pacific second only to Hawai‘, just as navy strategists had advocated ever since the first Orange Plans.</p>
                <p>For the indigenous people of the region, however, it would be a different story. In the judgment of an analyst writing in 1975, American administration of Micronesia failed “to meet the diverse needs which exist among the islands.” The militarized U.S. region- al policy would constrict Guam’s development even though the island enjoyed an unprecedented econom- ic boom the first five years after World War II.</p>
                <p>Social Change and Economic Boom</p>
                <p>While Washington was busy once more playing the old game of realpolitik in the new geopolitical set- ting of the postwar Pacific, Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, who had replaced Nimitz as CINCPAC (CINCPOA no longer existed), issued a directive in December 1945 to reestablish peacetime naval gov- ernment on Guam until such time as a permanent civil government was duly constituted. In accord with the directive, the wartime military government under Major General Larsen was replaced in May 1946 by the “navy island government,” with Rear Admiral Charles A. (Baldy) Pownall, who was also COMNAVMAR. Rota, with fewer than a thousand residents, was administered from Guam until the TTPI took over all the northern Marianas in 1947. The new governor of Guam therefore combined re- gional military authority and local civil power to a greater degree than had any prewar American naval governor.</p>
                <p>For civil matters, Pownall reported back to the Pentagon to the office of the assistant chief of naval operations for island government. This office su- pervised the governments of Guam and American</p>
                <p>193</p>
                <p>Samoa (Hawai‘i, the third U.S. flag territory in the Pacific, had been under an organic act since 1900 with civil local self-government). Since Guam and American Samoa were not self-governing, the navy reported annually to the United Nations on the status of the islands. The first such report in July 1946 stated that navy policy was to “assist the na- tives toward achieving economic independence in a ‘Guam for Guamanians’ and a ‘Samoa for Samo- ans,’... with the ultimate aim of fitting both races for United States citizenship.”</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the United Nations rejected the na- vy’s first report and criticized naval rule on Guam as “colonial” and “departing from the principles of a democratic nation.” As a result, in late 1946 in a rare editorial devoted to Guam, the New York Times asked “what has been done...to institute the necessary reforms on Guam?” The Seventh Guam Congress, which was the last prewar Congress, had reconvened in March 1946 and also sent a mes- sage to President Truman, asking his assistance in providing civil liberties. Truman sent off a letter to Pownall for public release in which the president ex- pressed sympathy for the people of Guam, but no other action was taken.</p>
                <p>On Guam as of June 1946, nearly two years after liberation, the makeshift refugee camps for Cha- morros were at last empty, but an estimated 10,000 people still lived in temporary government-provided houses in the new communities. The navy had am- bitious plans for five major civilian rehabilitation projects for construction of new villages and a gen- eral hospital, all at an estimated cost of $20 mil- lion. The Seventy-ninth U.S. Congress, however, ap- propriated only $6 million in 1946, and this money was to be expended by January 1949. That amount proved inadequate.</p>
                <p>The navy used nearly all the $6 million on “New Agana” alone for paved roads, curbs, and street- lights along the neat new rectangular blocks of the capital. The new town layout, however, chopped up old lots in a tangle of property lines that resulted in numerous lawsuits and endless delays over emi- nent domain that prevented the return of most for-</p>

                <p>mer residents to Agana and blocked reconstruction. Much of downtown Agana is still empty. The de- struction of old Agana and the failure to reconstruct the capital left a void not only in the civic infrastruc- ture of the island, but also in the psyche of the lo- cal people. They have been without a governmental center ever since World War II.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of limited funds and various delays in resettlement, at the navy’s request the Sev- enty-ninth U.S. Congress passed the Land Transfer Act in November 1945 to make federal land avail- able to Guam residents in replacement of land ac- quired for military use. After much delay, the navy offered Guamanians in the temporary communities the opportunity of buying their new government- provided lots at bargain prices instead of waiting to rebuild on their old prewar properties. Hundreds of Guamanians accepted the navy’s offer. The prewar village patterns were thus massively rearranged in the central and northern villages, where the major- ity of Chamorros resided.</p>
                <p>In June 1945 a public referendum requested the governor to call a general election under a reappor- tioned municipal system that reflected population shifts caused by the war. Governor Pownall prompt- ly agreed. In the election in July, the first woman to be elected to the Eighth Guam Congress, Rosa T. Aguigui, a teacher at the Merizo Elementary School (and assistant to Laura Thompson before the war), won a seat in the House of Assembly.</p>
                <p>While the navy encouraged social change on Guam after the war, it was more conservative in economic matters. The navy’s policy was expressed in the official monthly navy report to Washington in April 1946: “The economic development [of Guam] must be geared to meet the demands of these ser- vice and service connected personnel and cannot be geared to the financial, technical, or business ability of the Guamanian entrepreneur.” By insisting on a command economy for Guam that restricted private investment, the navy hoped to limit inflation and ci- vilian demands that might place limits on military priorities. Inflation was curbed, but Guamanian de- mands for civil liberties would prove impossible to contain.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>Publicly, the navy based its curtailment of free enterprise on the need to protect the Guamanians from foreign and American merchants, and even from Guamanian businessmen. The navy argued that “any policy to guard the Guamanians against foreign exploitation must consider the need to guard the Guamanians against exploitation by Gua- manians.” Those whom the navy considered to be exploiters of their fellow Guamanians were most- ly from the old manak‘kilo, called ge‘hilo‘ (upper class) families by Chamorros. As might be expected, the navy’s attitude provoked opposition to naval government among those families.</p>
                <p>The means that the navy used to control com- merce was the requirement of a security clearance for anyone traveling to and from the region. The le- gal basis was President Roosevelt’s 1941 Executive Order 8683, which remained in effect even though the war had ended. The navy permitted no civilian tourists or businessmen, foreign or American, to visit Guam unless affiliated with a military purpose. The airfields and Apra Harbor remained closed to civilian commerce except for Pan Am flights and military charters of civilian ships and aircraft on which authorized local businesses could transport goods. Local firms could not employ alien workers, as could the military and off-island contractors. To protect Guamanians from outside exploiters, local businesses had to be at least 51 percent owned by Guamanians, and only Guamanians could purchase property on Guam or lease it for more than five years.</p>
                <p>Despite the restrictions on outside investment, Guam’s economy boomed from late 1945 into the early 1950s, owing initially to war surplus sales, then to the extraordinary volume of military con- struction on the island. To get around prohibitions on outside investment, a number of U.S. servicemen and civilians stationed on Guam teamed up as mi- nority partners with Guamanians to form success- ful businesses. These partnerships included one between Kenneth T. (Ken) Jones, Jr., and Segundo (Sai Pakito) P.Leon Guerrero, who formed Jones and Guerrero (J and G) Enterprises. Other businesses were kept in local hands, such as the Ada family</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>enterprises under Pedro Martinez Ada, who became Guam’s first millionaire, and the Calvo Enterprises led by Eduardo T. Calvo.</p>
                <p>Politics and the Renewed Drive for Citizenship</p>
                <p>Guamanians emerged from World War II much more pro-American than before. This change was due largely to appreciation for being freed from the brutality suffered under the Japanese occupation, which made the prewar military colonialism under the U.S. Navy look almost benign in comparison. Despite the enhanced appreciation of American rule, local politics on Guam after the war soon split into two vague groupings: those Guamanians who tended to support navy policies and those who did not. This political division began in 1946, when a group of fifteen prominent Chamorro men from the old mestizo manak‘kilo families created a non- profit association called the Friends of Guam. These men had led the struggle for Chamorro rights prior to the war. They still opposed military restrictions and now sought civil government. Naval officers called them the “opposition group” and believed that the association was instigated by members of the “Big Five” families (a reference the navy appar- ently borrowed from Hawai‘i, where a group of five Caucasian families controlled Hawai‘i’s econ- omy). Guam’s “Big Five” families were those led by C.C. Butler, José M. Torres, the Gollo-Perez family, Pedro P. Martinez, and the Bordallos.</p>
                <p>All associations had to be registered with the na- val government before they could function, but the civil administrator, Captain Anderson, refused to register the Friends of Guam. An American journal- ist, Lloyd Norman of the Chicago Tribune, reported that “the Navy is quietly trying to break the grip of the ‘Big Five’ families upon Guam’s economy.” He also noted that Captain Anderson kept a blacklist of “commies” in the opposition group.</p>
                <p>To counter the opposition group, the naval gov- ernment encouraged “have-not” local families to invest in a new retail trade company, the Guam Commercial Corporation, under the leadership of Antonio Borja (Tony) Won Pat. This shrewd former</p>
                <p>195</p>
                <p>schoolteacher of Chinese-Chamorro ancestry had been a representative of Sumay village to the House of Assembly prior to the war. After the war, he be- came an entrepreneur as owner of the Hollywood Cafe in 1946-1947 and president of the Guam Ju- nior Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                <p>Chamorros who invested in the Guam Commer- cial Corporation tended to support the navy view that “Guam has to achieve a self-supporting econo- my before it can be ready for American citizenship,” as Won Pat said to Lloyd Norman in May 1947. Navy officials supported these men in order to en- courage entrepreneurship, but a navy analysis in December 1946 (restricted to official Washington, D.C., readers at the time) frankly described Guam as a “regulated, non-competitive economy super- vised by a paternalistic government.”</p>
                <p>The Guam Commercial Corporation was success- ful in the boom on Guam from 1946 into the early 1950s, but it went bankrupt in 1954. Its members nevertheless used the corporation and tacit navy support as a base to dominate local politics for the next twenty years after establishing the Commercial Party in late 1946. Won Pat became speaker of the House of Assembly in 1948 and would go on to be the first speaker of the new Guam Legislature in 1951 and Guam’s first delegate to the U.S. Congress in the 1960s. He was the island’s most influential politician until the early 1980s.</p>
                <p>The Friends of Guam dissolved as an organiza- tion in 1947, but the members went on to lead the fight to end naval government and bring about the Organic Act of 1950. They formed the Welfare Par- ty in 1949 but were not successful in electoral poli- tics largely because they represented the vestiges of the old prewar manak‘kilo elite and were therefore not particularly popular with ordinary islanders. In any case, those Guamanians who took strong public stands on political issues, whether pro- or antinavy, were a minority in the postwar years. The major- ity of Guamanians avoided offending their military rulers, a lesson they learned the hard way under the Japanese.</p>
                <p>These quiet Guamanians nevertheless generally agreed on one issue: they wanted to be U.S. citi-</p>
                <p>196</p>
                <p>zens. The first mass naturalization of Guamanians as U.S. citizens took place in July 1946, when 113 uniformed Guamanian men in the U.S. Navy were sworn in on the Plaza de Espafia as Americans. By then, Guamanian and Filipino men eighteen years old or older who knew English could join the reg- ular U.S. armed forces. Those men who served a minimum of three years could be naturalized under the Nationality Act of 1940, and about 600 Gua- manian veterans of World War II (who also came under the GI Bill of Rights) were naturalized in the postwar period.</p>
                <p>While Guamanian servicemen could obtain citi- zenship, Guamanian civilians could not be natural- ized because neither were they born in the United States (since Guam was an unincorporated territo- ry) nor were they foreign citizens who can be made U.S. citizens by congressional legislation. In May 1946, the Seventh Guam Congress asked the navy once more to seek citizenship for all Guamanians, but nothing came of the effort. Subsequently, the Eighth Guam Congress debated the citizenship is- sue and in January 1947 unanimously requested in Joint Resolution No. 1 that Governor Pownall ask the U.S. Congress to grant American citizen- ship to Guamanians and to pass an organic act for the island. For technical reasons (failure to provide “official copies” to the governor), Pownall delayed transmittal of the request until April. It was then held up by the debate building up in Washington, D.C., over Guam’s governance.</p>
                <p>The debate had begun in 1946 but was amplified by a visit to Guam in February 1947 by Secretary of the Interior Harold S. Krug with a congressional delegation. Krug supported civilian government for Guam and endorsed the old proposal that Guam should come under the Department of the Interior, as were the Virgin Islands by then. In the meantime, the Guam Congress in January 1947 asked the gov- ernor to refer all “local laws,” including the civil budget of the naval government, to the Guam Con- gress for review and approval before enactment. Unlike the delay over the citizenship—organic act request, Pownall recommended to Washington that</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>the second request be approved. As with the first request, the Department of the Navy delayed action because it was by now also waiting for a report by a three-man civilian fact-finding committee headed by Dr. Ernest M. Hopkins, president of Dartmouth College. The committee was visiting Guam and American Samoa in February and March 1947.</p>
                <p>The Hopkins committee had been charged in Jan- uary by Defense Secretary Forrestal with inspecting and recommending changes in the governments of Guam and American Samoa because of the criticism of navy rule by liberals and the media in the United States. After visiting the islands and holding public meetings, in March 1947 the committee submitted a report to Forrestal that recommended Guamani- ans be given U.S. citizenship, an organic act, local legislative powers, a new trial court, and a special court for land matters. The report criticized navy administration, but in a constructive manner, and recommended the navy continue to govern Guam until an organic act was enacted.</p>
                <p>Following the Hopkins report, a cabinet-level U.S. secretarial committee created by Truman back in 1945 finally released its report in June 1947. It, too, recommended that “separate organic legisla- tion for Guam to provide civil government and to grant citizenship, a bill of rights, and legislative power to Guamanians should be enacted this ses- sion.” Although some liberals criticized the Hop- kins report as a whitewash of navy rule, several bills that incorporated the Hopkins proposals were promptly introduced in the Eightieth Congress.</p>
                <p>Reforms of Guam’s government were vigor- ously supported on the mainland by liberals such as Harold L. Ickes, former secretary of the Interior. Public and congressional knowledge of Guam was increased by the appearance in 1947 of the third edition of Laura Thompson’s 1941 book, Guam and Its People. This revised postwar edition sharply criticized Guam’s naval administration. As of 1947, another source of antinavy sentiment was the small Institute of Ethnic Affairs in Washington, D.C. The president of the institute, John Collier, was Laura Thompson’s husband, and she was a founding member. He had been commissioner of Indian af-</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>fairs in the Interior Department under Harold Ickes, where he had been sensitized to the plight of indig- enous peoples. The institute distributed a newslet- ter, the Guam Echo, from 1947 to 1950, supported by subscriptions from Guamanians and statesiders. Guam Echo editor Doloris Coulter, along with John Collier, bombarded newspapers with letters critical of naval rule in Guam, the TTPI, and American Sa- moa. Despite the lobbying by the Institute of Eth- nic Affairs, bills to provide Guamanians civil rights failed, for the time being.</p>
                <p>While the debate over Guam’s affairs heated up in Washington, back on Guam Governor Pownall, angry at Guamanian opponents of navy rule who supported the Guam Echo, ordered security inves- tigations and special ONI surveillance of EB. Leon Guerrero and his associates. Pownall released the findings, which alleged that EB. was a commu- nist subversive. The people of Guam ignored the allegations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, former Guam Governor Willis W. Bradley, Jr., now a congressman from California, also sponsored a Guam citizenship bill early in the Eightieth Congress, but it too failed. Under mount- ing pressure by bills, reports, and critics to liberalize Guam’s government, the navy decided it was time</p>
                <p>197</p>
                <p>to compromise. In August 1947, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan issued a proclamation that gave the Guam Congress authority to legislate, in- cluding budgets, and to override a veto by the gov- ernor by a two-thirds majority in both houses. The bill in question would then be referred to the secre- tary of the navy for resolution. This step received much praise at the time and was later dubbed the Interim Organic Act. It relieved the political pres- sure on the navy and deflected, for the time being, enactment of reform bills that would have curbed naval authority.</p>
                <p>After the Interim Organic Act, measures passed by the Guam Congress and signed by the governor were called “acts” with the force of local law. Rela- tions between Pownall and the Guam Congress re- turned to normal in 1948. That year saw passage of a local act that instituted elections of village com- missioners, but the governor still appointed the chief commissioner. Guamanians soon learned, however, that the Interim Organic Act allowed the governor the authority to change laws and to initiate legisla- tion by executive order when the Guam Congress was not in session. And he usually had the support of the secretary of the navy when he vetoed bills. So there was no real separation of powers; it was still a military executive government as before the war.</p>
                <p>Bishop Baumgartner and Governor Pownall, 1948. Rear Admiral Charles A. Pownall was Commander Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) and gov- ernor of Guam, 1946-1949. The Most Reverend Appolinaris W. Baumgartner, an American Capuchin, was bishop of Guam, 1945-1970. These two men were the most influential officials on the island in the immediate post-World War II years. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>

                <p>War Claims and Land Alienation</p>
                <p>Nowhere was the governor’s power more mani- fest than in his control of compensation for Gua- manian war claims and in the acquisition of land for military purposes. Much of his power derived from public laws passed by Congress in 1945-1946 that were well meaning but often proved contrary to Guamanian interests when implemented. These laws included the Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 to compensate Chamorros for war damages and the Land Acquisition Act of 1946 that autho- rized the Navy Department to acquire private land for permanent military installations on the island.</p>
                <p>A Land and Claims Commission began to operate in April 1945, and it became the focus of Guamanian discontent. In order to hold down expenditures, the Navy Department placed ceilings of $5,000 on each property loss claim and $4,000 on each war-related death or injury claim. The navy accepted only a por- tion of the claims and paid a total of $8.3 million in compensation to 4,429 recipients by the time the last claim was settled in 1957. Only one maximum death claim of $4,000 was paid. All other death payments were less, including precisely $3,327.38 for Father Duenas, who had been executed for as- sisting the American holdout George Tweed.</p>
                <p>The largest amounts for property losses went to the biggest landowners, such as the Catholic Church, Atkins, Kroll, and the Torres, Butler, Mar- tinez, and Bordallo families. The claims and the payments to Chamorros were compensation for deaths, injuries, and damages caused mostly by the Americans in the reinvasion of Guam in 1944, not by the Japanese, from whom many Guamanians also expected compensation.</p>
                <p>Most Guamanians accepted the claims settle- ments, but dissatisfaction grew in the early 1950s, when they learned the United States had waived Guamanian war claims against the Japanese in the peace treaty with Japan. Later, under locally elected governors, the government of Guam began appeals to obtain war reparations when it was learned that Micronesians in the TTPI were authorized repara- tions from the United States and Japan of $20 mil-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>lion for war claims. This was a larger amount for former enemies than the United States provided to its own loyal Guamanians. Guamanian appeals, however, fell on deaf ears in Washington. As of the year 2006, full and adequate war reparations had yet to be authorized for the people of Guam.</p>
                <p>Inadequate compensation for war claims was not, however, as frustrating for Guamanians in the pe- riod 1944-1950 as was the acquisition of their land by the military. By late 1944, in addition to land taken for U.S. military bases, 1,500 acres of the best farmland on Guam were appropriated to grow produce and raise livestock and poultry for military consumption. Management of the U.S. mil- itary farm was initially under the Foreign Economic Administration and then under the United States Commercial Company (USCC), an entity of the U.S. federal government. Guamanians, already barred from military installations unless employees, were blocked from their Janchos on or near the USCC “Restricted” areas until the USCC was liquidated and it turned over its responsibilities to the island Department of Agriculture in June 1947.</p>
                <p>Although the number of military personnel fell drastically in the demobilization after the war, mili- tary need for property on Guam did not decrease in the Cold War that followed. In 1945, Admiral Nimitz wrote the U.S. chief of naval operations that U.S. objectives after the war would require 75,700 acres, or 55 percent of the island. Of the 75,700 acres needed, 28,345 were already owned by the United States from prewar purchases and tax confiscations, and 29,460 more acres were to be purchased (or condemned if the owner would not sell) at an average price of $54.00 per acre. The re- mainder of 17,895 acres was to be leased from Gua- manian owners at about sixty cents an acre. These modest amounts were based on 1941 appraisals even though postwar land prices on Guam had risen over 100 percent above the 1941 levels. The navy defended the low amounts paid as proper to avoid “ruinous and inflated land values...which could wreck the island economy.”</p>
                <p>One problem was that 40 percent of the needed</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>land was not surveyed because the navy had never completed an islandwide cadastral survey. The navy resumed cadastral work in 1944, including transla- tions and abstractions of old Spanish land records, but halted it in 1945 under the press of more imme- diate priorities. The Land and Claims Commission used imprecise records to the navy’s advantage to lease private land in large parcels at reduced col- lective rates instead of by individual lots at higher rents. The navy argued that the “lack of title infor- mation and survey data made it impractical to at- tempt to lease private land with standard leases.” This sophistic argument overlooked the fact that the U.S. Navy itself was responsible for the lack of land titles and survey data on Guam from before the war.</p>
                <p>By June 1947, only 190 out of 1,519 Guamanian claims for rent due were paid. The Land and Claims Commission land soon bogged down in the legal complexities of hundreds of property transactions. Higher commands nonetheless pressured the staff to go ahead in order for construction of new military projects to proceed.</p>
                <p>American military strategists planned to make Guam not only a logistical and operational base but also a secure link for command, control, com- munications and intelligence functions throughout the Asian rimlands and the western Pacific under CINCPAC headquarters in Hawai‘i. For this pur- pose, major projects included a 4,800-acre naval communications master station (NAVCAMS) in Finegayan and a 2,922-acre area for arrays of high- frequency radio antennas in Barrigada.</p>
                <p>Among other installations was the enormous na- val magazine of nearly 7,000 acres in the Fena area in south-central Guam for storage of conventional and nuclear warheads, chemical warfare agents, and munitions. To link this ammunition dump with the harbor, the navy completed in 1950 the all-weather Cross Island Road (now Route 17) between Agat and Talofofo. A dam completed on the Maagas Riv- er in 1951 created the 2,185-acre Fena Reservoir in- side the naval magazine area to ensure a water sup- ply to the navy’s facilities and civilian communities in the south. The Fena Reservoir remains a principal source of potable water on Guam.</p>
                <p>199</p>
                <p>To acquire land for the military’s needs, the Land and Claims Commission cut corners in apprais- als and in legal technicalities. Some Guamanians willingly sold or leased land to the military out of patriotism and with the understanding that they could eventually buy it back or redeem leases. Oth- ers, however, began to object, and some took their cases to court. It was in this unhappy atmosphere that navy officials received the Hopkins commit- tee report. In addition to recommending political changes to curb naval authority, the report criti- cized the navy’s handling of war claims and land matters. The committee concluded, “No additional land, not presently occupied by the military forces, should be taken if it can possibly be avoided. Only if such land is actually essential to national defense should the ousting of the local residents even be considered.”</p>
                <p>Naval authorities were concerned that the report might delay land acquisitions and thereby jeopar- dize strategic military objectives, although in reality much of the acquired land was for future contin- gency use and consequently lay unused for decades. In reaction to the Hopkins report, Pownall acceler- ated land condemnations instead of slowing them, and in October 1947 he created by executive order the Superior Court of Guam that had been recom- mended by the Hopkins Committee. The navy hired a statesider as judge and gave him jurisdiction over civil actions and land condemnation cases. A naval officer later wrote: “The new Superior Court is in reality a device by which all land condemnation proceedings are taken from the regular courts of Guam and placed in a court in which Guamanian judges have no role.”</p>
                <p>The Superior Court did speed up the processing of land transfers through condemnations: of some 6,000 cases on the court’s docket, nearly 3,000 were cleared by the end of 1949. Abuses, however, did not end. The judge regularly rejected Guamani- an claims for higher compensation, which he called “puffing,” and transactions were not always prop- erly registered. When his rulings were appealed, they were upheld since the navy had also made him the presiding judge of the Court of Appeals.</p>
                <p>200</p>
                <p>Increasingly frustrated by the navy’s insensitiv- ity, the Ninth Guam Congress passed resolutions in 1948 to have Guamanians represented in land deci- sions and to halt military plans to condemn Tumon Bay. The U.S. Air Force wanted to make the entire bay into a military recreational area off-limits to local fishermen and to local use of the beach. The governor rejected the other resolutions but com- promised on Tumon, making only half the bay off- limits to Guamanians. Fed up, the Guam Congress passed a bill in 1949 that requested the governor to abolish the Superior Court. Pownall vetoed the measure, and his veto was upheld by the secretary of the navy.</p>
                <p>One U.S. Congressman, William Lemke, who visited Guam with a subcommittee in November 1949, commented in a congressional hearing on the navy’s handling of land matters: “There were plenty of signs of abuse....For instance on Guam the military took the lands of the people and forgot to even ask them how much they wanted, or to pay for it. Where the Governor now lives and Admiral Nimitz had his headquarters—they finally offered, after they heard our committee was coming, $14.10 for rental of 15 acres of one of the most beautiful spots anywhere.”</p>
                <p>The site was Flag Circle on Nimitz Hill, and the $14.10 in rent was for the entire year. Despite com- plaints, the Land and Claims Commission went on acquiring land, and the navy’s Superior Court kept operating until the Organic Act was enacted in 1950. By then property controlled by the federal government was 58 percent of the island, or 3 per- cent more than planned by Nimitz in 1945. Most of the military projects were moving toward com- pletion, and old unneeded installations—but not always the land on which they stood—were aban- doned. Orote airfield, for example, was deactivated in February 1949, but the navy retained the entire peninsula. For the next four decades, land on Guam would be held hostage to the Cold War.</p>
                <p>By 1949, Guamanians were faced with another major problem: the influx of thousands of off-island American contractors and Filipino construction workers with salaries and allowances differenti-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>ated largely on the basis of race. Guamanian anger over the privileges of American employees, on top of other frustrations, would lead to a dramatic con- frontation between the Ninth Guam Congress and Governor Pownall and then to the removal of naval government itself from Guam.</p>
                <p>The End of Naval Government</p>
                <p>After the postwar military demobilization, the navy began bidding out contracts to American corpora- tions for new military projects for construction of the Apra Harbor breakwater, dredging of the har- bor, and general construction islandwide. Hundreds of technicians and white-collar American employees of contractors as well as naval government civilian hires flooded into Guam. By the end of 1947, there were nearly 7,000 American nonresident contract workers on the island.</p>
                <p>American reporter Harold Martin described many of these men in a November 1947 article in the Saturday Evening Post: “Some arrived drunk and stayed drunk as soon as they came ashore.... Bail jumpers, alimony dodgers, car thieves, artists in the forging of checks, armed robbery and the roll- ing of drunks—they descended on Guam....I never saw such people, said a contractor... we are getting scum I never had to work with before. But we need men so badly we don’t try to screen them.”</p>
                <p>Not all the newcomers, of course, were “scum.” Many reliable, hardworking men came as foremen, technicians, and engineers. Some of these, along with discharged servicemen, remained on the island and married Guamanian women, just as had the Spaniards, Filipinos, and U.S. sailors and marines before the war. Also like the Spaniards, the Ameri- cans turned to the Philippines for workers owing to the labor shortage on Guam. In May 1947, the gov- ernments of the United States and the Philippines exchanged notes that constituted an agreement for “the recruitment and employment of Philippine citi- zens by the U.S. military forces and its contractors in the Pacific, including Guam.”</p>
                <p>Technically, immigration to Guam came under the U.S. Immigration Act of 1917, but that act was</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>tacitly ignored, and the U.S. Navy, not the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), processed and controlled immigrants and nonim- migrants in Guam and the TTPI until June 1952, when dual administration was established between the navy and the INS. In fact, the U.S.-Philippines exchange of notes was not in compliance with U.S. immigration laws but was expedient to allow the military to obtain Filipino laborers without need for Philippine passports or U.S. visas. The U.S.- Philippines exchange of notes specified that Filipino workers were to be paid the current Philippine wage with a 25 percent overseas differential and were to receive room, board, medical care, and round-trip transportation from the point of hire. These require- ments would be repeatedly violated by contractors in the years ahead.</p>
                <p>Filipino workers, predominantly Visayans, soon flooded into Guam at a rate of up to 500 per month. A lively financial industry grew to handle thousands of dollars in currency exchanges and in remittances by workers to their families in the Philippines. Huge camps were constructed to house these men and the few Filipinas among them. The largest, Camp Roxas north of Agat, with mess halls, movie houses, a beach, and miles of dreary barracks, held 7,000 men, mostly Visayans.</p>
                <p>A major problem for Guamanians with the labor system was the differential pay scales established by the navy. There were four civilian pay scales on Guam: an A scale for Americans hired on the main- land at the highest wages and brought to Guam with the most benefits and with commissary and PX privileges; a B “local hire” scale for Americans hired on Guam at lower pay and benefits than mainland hires; another “local hire” scale for Guamanians at a still lower rate, even if they did the same work as the higher-paid Americans; and a fourth, and low- est, scale for Filipino contract workers at about one- third of the American A scale. The Filipinos, who numbered around 28,000 in 1948, usually did most of the labor. This system saved the U.S. military money and provided high profits to contractors.</p>
                <p>The navy’s rationale for segregated wages was, again, to prevent inflation on Guam. Inflation was</p>
                <p>201</p>
                <p>curbed, but the result was to make the aliens’ low wages, which were artificially set by the govern- ment, the prevailing wages for Guam’s small, strug- gling private sector. Guamanians understandably shunned these low salaries and flocked into high- er-paying and more comfortable government jobs, swelling the island bureaucracy enormously.</p>
                <p>The composition of the labor force and employ- ment by sector by 1950 thus had shifted dramati- cally in comparison with 1940. Before the war, the island workforce was 92 percent Chamorro, with 53 percent in agriculture. Ten years later 65 per- cent of the workforce was non-Chamorro (mostly Filipino contract workers), and only 6 percent was in agriculture. The cultivation of rice, a staple food on Guam since precontact times, practically ceased (most rice since World War II has been imported to Guam from California, as are other foods). Cha- morros now worked primarily for the government. The overloading of the public sector on Guam left the private sector depressed by the mid-1950s and periodically short of labor thereafter.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1948, relations between Pownall and the Guam Congress had deteriorated over wage pol- icies, temporary alien workers, land issues, and lo- cal civil rights. In January 1949, after much debate, the House of Council passed another resolution to petition for American citizenship. Simultaneously, the council approved for the first time a controver- sial bill for a special committee to draft an organic act to be submitted to the U.S. Congress.</p>
                <p>While these two measures were being considered, the House of Assembly was also investigating vio- lations of the prohibition against Americans own- ing local businesses through Guamanian “front men.” Antinavy sentiment was most pronounced in the Guam House of Assembly. The assembly subcommittee on trade and commerce subpoenaed an American civilian employee of the navy, Abra- ham (Abe) Goldstein, who had financed a women’s clothing store. The power of the Guam Congress to subpoena Americans had already been vetoed by Pownall back in 1948, so when Goldstein appeared before the subcommittee in early February 1949,</p>
                <p>202</p>
                <p>he refused to answer questions on the basis that the Guam Congress was exceeding its authority.</p>
                <p>The Guamanians knew that Abe Goldstein might decline to answer, and they intended to provoke a confrontation with Pownall to stir up media atten- tion in support of the bill for an organic act and the petition for citizenship. One assemblyman, Carlos P. Taitano, had recently been a captain in the U.S. Army and knew the power of the Ameri- can press when aroused. In early 1949, he met two visiting newsmen from the United Press Interna- tional (UPI) and Associated Press (AP) bureaus in Honolulu. They agreed to file stories about Guam from Honolulu in return for exclusive reports from Taitano.</p>
                <p>On February 12, the assembly subcommittee de- clared Goldstein guilty of contempt and issued a warrant for his arrest. Governor Pownall promptly intervened and halted execution of the warrant by the police. Speaker of the House of Assembly Won Pat then met with Pownall, who advised him to re- fer the matter to the executive branch for resolu- tion. Won Pat, angered at Pownall’s stiff-necked re- action, relayed this advice to the House of Assembly in March on the day the assembly was debating the controversial organic act bill and the latest petition for citizenship.</p>
                <p>Infuriated by Pownall’s actions, the assembly passed the bill and the petition. They then voted unanimously to adjourn until “this body receives a reply on the action of the Congress of the Unit- ed States relative to the Organic Act for Guam as passed by both Houses of the Guam Congress.” This was the first time the Guam Congress ever de- fied U.S. authority. Carlos Taitano rushed to report to his press contacts in Honolulu by telegram. The New York Times reported “GUAM ASSEMBLY QUITS” on March 6 and “CONGRESS WALK- OUT” on March 7. On March 8, Pownall called for a special joint session of the Guam Congress. The members of the assembly decided not to attend. The Honolulu Advertiser, again prompted by a Tai- tano telegram, headlined “GUAM CONGRESS RE- VOLT GROWS.” On March 12, only one assembly- man showed up at the joint session to hear Pownall</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>defend his actions. Five days later, after getting legal advice from his attorney general (exceedingly poor advice, it would turn out), Pownall announced that thirty-four of the thirty-six assemblymen (two had voted to attend the March 12 session) had willfully violated the law and that their seats were vacated.</p>
                <p>Moreover, and here Pownall made an error fatal to his and the naval government’s future on Guam, he announced, again like the old Yo, el Rey, edicts of the Spanish kings, that he would appoint re- placements to the vacant seats instead of holding elections. Public reaction was immediately hostile. Meetings in twelve of Guam’s nineteen villages declared that the people would not recognize any appointees. This was a sound legal stance since the governor had approved an act the year before that allowed vacant seats to be filled only with the “pri- or concurrence of the Guam Congress.”</p>
                <p>Guamanian defiance of the military government was gleefully reported by the wire services and mainland news media, just as Carlos Taitano want- ed. “GUAM REBELS AT NEW NAVY” proclaimed a Washington Post article on April 3. In the article, Taitano was reported as saying that the political revolt grew out of three major long-standing griev- ances: “(1) Arbitrary rule by naval government; (2) lack of a constitution or documents anywhere guar- anteeing civil rights; (3) lack of a court of appeal beyond the Secretary of the Navy.”</p>
                <p>Letters critical of navy rule hit the mainland news- papers, one of the most caustic written to the New York Times by Doloris Coulter, editor of the Guam Echo. Members of the U.S. Congress queried the White House for explanations. Pownall had unwit- tingly done exactly what the reformers had hoped for. Feeling the heat, Pownell invited the elected as- semblymen back to their seats. They jubilantly re- turned to the Guam Assembly Hall in May.</p>
                <p>White House reaction was swift and unsympathetic to the navy. Truman, a moderately liberal Democrat, had been reelected president, and he was thereafter one of the most decisive presidents in U.S. history. In view of Guam’s status under United Nations cri- teria as a non-self-governing colony, the first thing</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>Truman did in March 1949 when he learned of the walkout in Agana was to ask the State Department for an assessment. State replied that the Guamani- ans were loyal and not a security risk to the United States, but, unless a change was made in Guam’s government, they could become radicalized. State urged that the Department of the Interior take over in one year.</p>
                <p>The White House agreed and instructed the Inte- rior Department to draft an organic act for civilian government of Guam. Truman approved the draft in May and notified the navy and the Interior Depart- ment by letter that the act would be introduced as an administration bill into the Eighty-first Congress and that the navy was to turn over administration of Guam to the Department of the Interior within twelve months. The draft organic act was then sub- mitted to the U.S. Congress. Truman also ordered the transfer of American Samoa and the TTPI to the Interior within two to three years.</p>
                <p>Interior met with the Navy Department to plan the transition, which involved replacement of Pow- nall with an appointed civilian governor. An inter- agency agreement was quickly worked out and ap- proved by Truman, but with the provisos that the navy would retain a voice for an interim period in the administration of the island and also that the security clearance would remain in force under navy control. The navy would later justify continuation of these provisos on the grounds that Guam was a U.S. support base for the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950.</p>
                <p>The incident over the ownership of a women’s dress shop was a turning point in the postwar po- litical history of Guam. If the walkout had not hap- pened, the Korean War would probably have been used as justification for the navy to perpetuate its rule on Guam. As it turned out, the walkout set in motion the end of military government on Guam after an incredible duration of 277 years since the death of Father San Vitores in 1672.</p>
                <p>At a special joint session in May, the Ninth Guam Congress passed a resolution thanking President Truman for his “momentous decision in calling for transfer of the administration for Guam to a civilian</p>
                <p>203</p>
                <p>agency.” A week earlier, the Guam Congress had created a special two-man committee to proceed to Washington to appeal for passage of an organic act as a follow-up to the transfer of administration. The two men were FE. B. Leon Guerrero and Antonio Won Pat. Unlike the trip undertaken by Leon Guererro and B.J. Bordallo in the 1930s, this time the Guam Congress authorized $10,000 for expenses, and this time the outcome would be successful. Meanwhile, the issue of Abe Goldstein’s subpoena was dropped. He left Guam unobtrusively.</p>
                <p>Governor Pownall retired on September 1, 1949, and grandly departed Apra Harbor on the USAT General Butner beneath a farewell flyover by B-29s and naval aircraft. Pownall was somewhat a vic- tim of circumstances as the last naval governor of Guam. From the military viewpoint, he fulfilled his mission as COMNAVMAR. During his three and a half years on Guam, he ably supervised construc- tion of vast installations that made the island a key link in the worldwide U.S. defense system. Unfortu- nately, the same trait of assertiveness that made him a fine naval officer prevented him from being flex- ible in civilian matters, where patience and subtlety were needed.</p>
                <p>On September 7, 1949, President Truman issued Executive Order 10077, which formally transferred administration of Guam to the Department of the Interior effective July 1, 1950. The same order re- voked President McKinley’s Executive Order 108-A of 1898, which had given Guam to the U.S. Navy. At Interior Secretary Krug’s recommendation, Truman appointed Carlton S. Skinner as Guam’s first civil- ian governor (other than the Sisto-Pérez-Coe “act- ing governorships” in 1898-1899). Skinner was a tall, thirty-six-year-old journalist from Connecticut who was the public relations director for the De- partment of the Interior. He had visited Guam with Krug in February 1947 and had helped to draft the new Guam Organic Act.</p>
                <p>Skinner took the formal oath of office September 27, 1949, in the newly rebuilt bandstand in the cen- ter of the Plaza de Espafia. Seven weeks later, he was baptized rudely by the Pacific Ocean when Typhoon Allyn swept over Guam on November 17, smashing</p>
                <p>204</p>
                <p>Inarajan and destroying 124 houses, some bridges, and most of the crops on the island.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, before proceeding with the bill for the draft organic act, the U.S. Congress sent a special House subcommittee on public lands, known as the Miles committee for its chairman, Democrat John E. Miles, to visit Guam, American Samoa, and the TTPI. The Miles committee held three days of hear- ings on Guam in late November 1949. All the hun- dred or so Guamanians who testified favored the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I2</p>
                <p>draft organic act, but they suggested a number of changes. Much pent-up frustration over land con- demnations also burst forth at the hearings. The subcommittee and later the full standing committee on public lands incorporated twenty-three changes in the bill. Democratic Congressman J. Hardin Pe- terson introduced the revised bill in February 1950 with the intent, he said, “to put an end to our ne- glect of the rights of the Guamanian people over the last 50 years.”</p>
                <p>Naval officials did not agree but by 1950 be-</p>
                <p>President Truman signing the Guam Organic Act, 1950. The ceremony took place in the White House on August 1, 1950. Truman’s signature made the act a federal law codified as 48 U.S.C. § 1421, et seq. The only Guamanian present at the ceremony was Carlos P. Taitano, later speaker of the Eighth Guam Legislature (behind the president in a white suit). The Organic Act, passed by the U.S. Congress without a vote on it by the people of Guam, made Guamanians USS. citizens, established civilian government, and remains the basic law of the island until the local people approve a constitution of their own. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>GIBRALTAR OF THE AMERICAN LAKE 1945-1950</p>
                <p>lieved that they could safely turn the island over to a civilian government without jeopardizing strate- gic military missions in the Pacific. In the hearings, the navy representative accepted the inevitable on a slightly defensive note of prudential forgetting: “The Department of the Navy desires to endorse most strongly the proposal now before the Con- gress.... The Department of the Navy, in review- ing the 50 years of its administration on Guam and American Samoa, feels a pride which is believed jus- tifiable in the progress made on these islands.”</p>
                <p>In his testimony, Governor Skinner diplomati- cally lauded the navy for its long administration of Guam. He also noted that “the people of Guam have had enough paternalistic protection. They want emancipation.”</p>
                <p>A similar view was expressed by Tun Kiko Zoi- lo—F.B.Leon Guerrero—the pudgy, self-taught lawyer and tenacious Chamorro-rights advocate who had first appealed to American justice thirteen years earlier. All other testimony, mainly by liber- al Democrats, also favored the bill. In April, Leon Guerrero and Won Pat met Truman to present a petition signed by 1,700 Guamanians in favor of the draft organic act. In May 1950, the U.S. House, controlled by a Democrat majority, passed the mea- sure, and, in July, the U.S. Senate, also controlled by the Democrats, approved it, with one major change: it made the new Guam Legislature unicameral.</p>
                <p>The Senate noted that, despite the change in gov-</p>
                <p>205</p>
                <p>ernment, Guam remained under the doctrine of the 1901 Insular Cases without possibility of statehood: “As an unincorporated Territory, Guam like Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is appurtenant to the United States and belongs to the United States, but is not a part of the United States, as distinguished from Alaska and Hawaii, which are incorporated territories. Unincorporated areas are not integral parts of the United States and no promise of state- hood or a status approaching statehood is held out to them.”</p>
                <p>President Truman signed the bill, H.R. 7273, into law on August 1, 1950, as the Organic Act of Guam, but it was made effective as of July 21, the sixth anniversary of Liberation Day in 1944. The only Guamanian invited to the signing in the White House was Carlos Taitano, who by then was a law student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.</p>
                <p>The eight years and eight months from December 8, 1941, to August 1, 1950, had been a period of the most traumatic involuntary changes for the island’s people since the Spanish-Chamorro wars. Although Guam was still bound by the old colonial dogma of the Insular Cases, the year 1950 marked the begin- ning of a new era for the island, an era of gradual partial decolonization, rising material standards of living, and peaceful social progress for the people of the island.</p>

                <p>Under the Organic Act</p>
                <p>1950-1970</p>
                <p>Partial Decolonization</p>
                <p>The first few years after passage of the Organic Act produced an intense but progressive governmen- tal transformation on Guam. Prior to the act, the navy administered Guam as a military base with the island’s civil government of minor priority within the military chain of command in the Pacific un- der CINCPAC in Hawai‘i. After the act, the island government’s responsibilities expanded with direct civilian links to the Congress and to the executive branch, even though in size, people, and resources Guam is analogous (albeit with unique differences as a territory rather than a subdivision of a larger entity such as a state) to a small, semi-rural county or municipality in the overall U.S. system.</p>
                <p>Governor Skinner, who worked under the navy until the Organic Act passed Congress, found him- self reappointed all over again in 1950 under the Interior Department. Skinner’s administration and the Guam legislature wrote new local laws that in- cluded an Election Code, a Civil Service Code, a ci- vilian retirement system, building and land laws, a tax law, and other statutes that reshaped Guam into a modern civilian government for the first time. He replaced all military personnel in the government with civilians, predominantly Guamanians, under new wage scales and a merit system for the 1,728 classified civil service positions.</p>
                <p>206</p>
                <p>The navy removed itself from banking by sell- ing the Bank of Guam to the Bank of America in 1950. The U.S. selective service system was applied to Guam in 1951, and young Guamanians enlisted eagerly in the armed forces, easily filling Guam’s an- nual quotas for the Korean War. Civilian policemen and firemen, now nearly all Guamanians, ensured law and order without any further involvement of the U.S. Marines.</p>
                <p>In 1950, Skinner separated the civilian hospital at Oka, still in its two rusty Butler buildings, from the Naval Hospital and named it the Guam Memo- rial Hospital (GMH). For civilian medical person- nel, Skinner sent recruiters to the Philippines to hire physicians and nurses on contract. Those hired were accorded American credentials after examinations but received salaries lower than U.S. standards. Af- ter fulfilling their contracts, many of these Filipino professionals remained on Guam, becoming U.S. citizens and forming an important segment of the island’s private medical community.</p>
                <p>Research started on the local disease lytico-bodig after naval pathologists found a continuing high incidence of deaths among Chamorros from what the Americans still thought, as before the war, to be ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), which is fairly rare (about two new cases per 100,000 people) in the</p>
                <p>Governor Carlton S. Skinner, 1950. Appointed by President Harry Truman, Skinner was the first civilian governor of Guam after nearly three centuries of rule by military governors since the death of Father San Vitores. Governor Skinner helped draft the Guam Organic Act, and he instituted many lasting reforms to demilitarize Guam’s government during his tenure, 1950-1953. He is shown here on the Old Spanish Bridge in Agana. (Courtesy of Governor Skinner and the MacDuff Press, San Francisco)</p>
                <p>208</p>
                <p>United States. After the war, doctors discovered that lytico-bodig was not rare on Guam and that in some aspects it differs from ALS.</p>
                <p>The naval physicians renamed the bodig aspect of the disease, in which the spinal cord and brain are attacked, parkinsonism-dementia complex. In ALS, the lytico aspect, a sound brain is imprisoned in a paralyzed body. The relation between the two aspects is unclear. Umatac was long the center of the illness, as it had been in Spanish times, so it seemed that it might be hereditary, but it turned out not to be. Some researchers suspected consumption of fadang, the cycad federico seeds, which had in- creased among Chamorros in the war years, to be the cause of the disease, as Spanish governor Felipe de la Corte had warned back in 1865. Research on this “Guam riddle” has continued ever since, pri- marily on-island by neurologists K-M.Chen and John Steele. The causes and the cure of lytico-bodig have yet to be established, but incidences of the dis- ease have gradually decreased for unknown reasons.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Governor Skinner expanded the Guam public school system and revised the cur- riculum to stateside standards. Classes continued to be in English as before the war, but the Chamorro language was no longer forbidden in schools. The Twelfth Guam Legislature made both English and Chamorro the official languages, and the people spoke Chamorro and the Filipino languages freely anywhere on the island after 1950. Official docu- ments, however, were primarily in English.</p>
                <p>In 1952, the Territorial College of Guam with a two-year curriculum was established as Microne- sia’s first institution of higher education. This little junior college for elementary school teachers was set up under the DOE (Department of Education) by Dr. José R. Palomo, the first Chamorro Ph.D. and the director of the DOE. Palomo created the school with the assistance of his alma mater, Ohio State University, which accepted transfer credits un- til 1956, by which time the College of Guam was accredited on its own.</p>
                <p>Despite the civil transformation of local govern- ment, COMNAVMAR still ruled more than one- third of Guam’s land area and all the surrounding</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>air and water space except submerged inshore ar- eas, which the Interior Department claimed. Rivalry lingered for years between naval and civilian offi- cials owing to problems unresolved by the Organic Act. For all its welcome reforms, the act contained significant anomalies in American law with respect to Guamanian civil rights, local autonomy, the structure of the new civilian government, and the role of the military. The law remained in effect as of the year 2006 after many changes, but some of these anomalies remain. The major provisions of the Guam Organic Act are as follows:</p>
                <p>American Citizenship: Section 4 of the Organic Act conferred congressional—not constitutional— U.S. citizenship on those inhabitants of Guam born on the island after April 11, 1899; their children; and all those of Spanish and other nationalities resident on the island on that date. This provision excluded foreign nonresidents (mostly Filipino contract work- ers). As U.S. citizens after 1950, Guamanian fami- lies, not just men, could move to the mainland even though the navy still controlled travel clearances un- til 1962. Over the next decades, particularly after 1962, thousands of Guamanians departed to live in the states, where higher wages and living standards offered more opportunities than Guam.</p>
                <p>The Organic Act did not confer on Guamanians who remained on the island all the traditional func- tions of American citizenship, such as full political participation in the national government (for ex- ample permanent residents of Guam cannot vote for the U.S. president or vice president), protection from federal power, and access to all federal eco- nomic and social benefits. It took a while for Gua- manians to understand these anomalies, and many now consider themselves “second-class” Americans.</p>
                <p>Bill of Rights: Section 5 of the Organic Act pro- vided a Bill of Rights under Guam law similar to that of the U.S. Constitution, but it did not unequivocal- ly confer on Guamanians all the constitutional pro- tections of U.S. law, notably the privilege of habeas corpus and the prohibition against bills of attain- der (Article I, Section 9, clauses 2 and 3). Not until 1968, as part of the Guam Elective Governor Act (implemented in 1970), would the Congress amend</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>the Organic Act to apply to Guamanians the Article I guarantees and the first nine U.S. constitutional amendments. However, the Tenth Amendment and the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment, which would limit congressional power over Guam, still do not apply to the island.</p>
                <p>Political Status: Prior to the Organic Act, U.S. of- ficials usually called Guam a “possession” (with a small p). Section 3 of the Organic Act specifically declared Guam to be an unincorporated organized “Territory” (with a capital T) of the United States, but in practice the federal government still treats the island as an unorganized territory in accord with the Insular Cases. Thus, despite the elimination of military government, the Organic Act granted only limited self-rule to Guamanians. The Ninth Circuit Court confirmed the colonial nature of the island’s status in several cases.</p>
                <p>The Organic Act functions as a constitution for Guam, but it does not derive its powers from the people of the island. They never voted on it. The U.S. Congress retains full authority to amend the act or to enact any legislation it wishes for Guam with- out the consent of the people of the island, a power that the Congress does not possess when dealing with the citizens of a U.S. State. In other words, the Organic Act did not apply to Guam the normal stat- utory and judicial presumptions that favor full local democratic government in the American system.</p>
                <p>Civilian Administration: Section 3 of the act or- ganized a civilian government for Guam under “the general administrative supervision of the Secretary of Interior.” Guam was placed, along with other U.S. territories at the time (but not Puerto Rico), un- der the director of the Office of Territories (changed in 1970 to the Office of Territorial and International Affairs, or OTIA) within the Interior Department. The Interior functioned in the twentieth century as the federal clean-up crew for the residue of Ameri- can Manifest Destiny of the nineteenth century. Its reactionary oversight of Guam is a dark blemish on American government, as will be shown in Chapter 14, which describes how Interior secretly blocked a presidential order in the 1970s to bring about com- monwealth status for Guam.</p>
                <p>209</p>
                <p>In the bloated maze of the Interior Department, the insular territories are among the least important of its concerns. Although there have been fine civil servants in territorial affairs, such as Ruth G. Van Cleve (director, 1964-1969), these dedicated few could not overcome the self-serving inertia of Inte- rior’s bureaucracy. Therefore, Guam slipped to an even lower federal priority under the Interior than under the U.S. Navy.</p>
                <p>Local Government: Section 3 of the Organic Act created a local government of “three branches: ex- ecutive, legislative, and judicial.” The commissioner system in the nineteen villages was not addressed in the act and continued as before. The Government of Guam as a whole came to be called GovGuam for short by people on the island, by the media, and by federal authorities.</p>
                <p>In the federal and in state constitutions of the United States, the legislative branch of government, which is the one most representative of the people, is first in sequence and shares power equally with the other branches. The Organic Act reversed this traditional pattern by placing Guam’s executive branch (Section 6) ahead of the legislature (Section 10), both in sequence and in power. What the act did was to carry over much of the old naval gov- ernor’s powers to the appointed civilian governor. The effect was to perpetuate U.S. direct control of Guam through the executive branch by appointing the governor for a four-year term until the Elective Governor Act of 1968 provided for the governor to be locally elected as of 1970.</p>
                <p>The original act also provided for an appointed “Secretary of Guam” who functioned as a lieuten- ant governor until 1970, after which time the Elec- tive Governor Act made the position a formal lieu- tenant governor elected jointly with the governor for a four-year term. The governor may not serve longer than two terms, but may serve again after an interim of one term by another governor. The act gave the governor of Guam direct responsibility for the police, public health and education, which in the states are partially protected from executive control by independent boards and commissions.</p>
                <p>The Organic Act authorized the governor of</p>
                <p>210</p>
                <p>Guam to pass on to the U.S. president for resolution any legislation the governor vetoed but that was overridden by a two-thirds majority of the legisla- ture. This anomaly, whereby a federally appointed governor could circumvent a locally elected legisla- ture, was removed by the 1968 Elective Governor Act. The 1968 act, however, did not substantially reduce the governor’s other powers. Once Gua- manians took over as elected chief executives after 1970, they used the broad powers granted Guam’s governor to administer (and to politicize) education, medicine, law enforcement, and other public servic- es on the island more directly than is the normal practice in American state and local governments.</p>
                <p>The Organic Act created a single house, named the Legislature of Guam, of not more than twenty- one senators (reduced in 1999 to fifteen). The only other unicameral legislature in the United States is that of Nebraska. A single house has saved Guam money, as did the 1999 reduction of senators to fif- teen. In the beginning, Guam’s senators considered their work to be part-time public service, but gradu- ally they came to view it as a full-time occupation (and sometimes as a lifetime career).</p>
                <p>After the first election under the Organic Act took place on November 7, 1950, the legislators designated the new body to be the First Guam Leg- islature (1951-1952) in place of the Eleventh, and last, Guam Congress. Curiously, at-large elections are not specified in the Guam Election Code but have been assumed to be the proper method among districts, each of which comprises one or more vil- lages. In 1976, the Guam Legislature divided the twenty-one legislative seats among four voting dis- tricts rather than at-large, regardless of population. This step tacitly assured Chamorros (located mostly in Agana and the less populated southern and cen- tral villages) political control in face of a rising Fili- pino population (located primarily in the northern villages of Dededo and Yigo). After a successful challenge to this apportionment was upheld in the federal District Court in 1982 (federal law prohibits at-large elections that dilute minority votes), vot- ing switched back to at-large under a new law (P.L. 16-121) that increased the number of seats for the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>northern districts to seven seats, but the law did not establish a permanent at-large system. Thus the is- sue of Guam’s at-large electoral system (which still favors Chamorro candidates but faces a constantly rising tide of non-Chamorro voters) remains open to challenge in federal court because no local law has reinstated at-large voting.</p>
                <p>Only the U.S. Congress may alter the Organic Act, and in the years since 1950 the act has been amended many times, usually at the request of the Guam Legislature. Section 11 restricts Guam’s legis- lative power to local matters “not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and the laws of the United States applicable to Guam.” What is or is not incon- sistent (called “inorganic” with respect to the act) and what is applicable have been matters of litiga- tion. In short, under the Organic Act, Guam lacks the local legislative autonomy possessed not only by the U.S. states but also by Puerto Rico (since 1952) and the Northern Mariana Islands (since 1976). The United States does not treat its five territories equally in terms of local powers.</p>
                <p>Law and the Judiciary: Section 22 of the Organic Act initiated the creation of a civil legal system on Guam. At the top of the system, the act established the federal District Court of Guam with jurisdiction for all cases arising from local as well as federal laws until 1974. Section 22 also authorized the new gov- ernment of Guam to establish local courts. Appeals are to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco and on to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>The District Court absorbed the cases of the old Superior Court, which dissolved when the Organic Act went into effect. To support the new federal court, the act created positions for a U.S. district at- torney and a U.S. marshal on Guam under the U.S. Department of Justice. The navy’s ONI (later called the Naval Intelligence Service, or NIS) continued to be the only federal investigative agency on Guam until 1974, when the Federal Bureau of Investiga- tion set up an office in Agana. Contrary to rumors, the CIA never established a permanent office on Guam.</p>
                <p>To accomplish the reorganization of Guam’s ju- diciary and to recompile the island’s laws after the</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>Organic Act, the First Guam Legislature hired attor- ney John A. Bohn as legislative counsel. Bohn, along with Albert B. Maris, a former judge on the Guam Court of Appeals, wrote the Judiciary Act of Guam, which was passed in 1951 and which established the Island Court.</p>
                <p>A quarter of a century later, under the authority of Section 22 of the Organic Act, the Twelfth Guam Legislature passed the Court Reorganization Act, which was implemented in 1974. This law renamed the Island Court the Superior Court with jurisdic- tion over all cases arising from Guam law. Income tax cases, however, are still tried in the federal Dis- trict Court. Appeals from the Superior Court go to the District Court and then up the federal appellate chain. As will be discussed later, a Guam Supreme Court would later be created above the Superior Court, resulting in much rivalry and controversy.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Bohn recodified the laws of Guam from all the old statutes, acts, executive or- ders, and so forth that had made up the accretion of laws under the navy. This much-needed local codification culminated in 1953 in the new Code of Guam. The new code finally gave Guam a judi- ciary responsive to local needs, but the reforms were incomplete. The Organic Act omitted mention of trials by jury and rights to grand jury indictment, which did not exist under the navy. It took a few years to establish jury trials and grand jury indict- ments in both federal and local courts on Guam.</p>
                <p>Taxes and Duties: Under naval rule, the residents of Guam—except for military personnel—did not pay income taxes. With the transfer to civilian gov- ernment, funds were needed in place of the navy subsidies to support the island government. In order to avoid having Congress appropriate annual subsi- dies to Guam, as it did for the navy, the Organic Act imposed federal income taxes on all residents and businesses on the island. This shocked everyone on Guam. Screams of protest rose, and court suits chal- lenged the taxation but lost.</p>
                <p>Since 1951, all island residents have paid their in- come taxes on standard U.S. Internal Revenue Ser- vice forms, just as Americans do in the states, but that money is not sent to the IRS in Washington.</p>
                <p>211</p>
                <p>Federal taxes collected on the island remain in the Treasury of Guam. This form of taxation is called a mirror tax since it duplicates the federal tax but in actuality is a local tax.</p>
                <p>Real estate taxes, which had been suspended af- ter World War II, were reinstituted in 1953 at rates of 1 percent of 50 percent of assessed market value for land and 0.5 percent for buildings, regardless of zoning or use. This low—and popular—rate helped stop the loss of land by Guamanians owing to tax debts, as occurred before the war under navy rule. The Organic Act also empowered GovGuam to sell general obligation bonds within certain limits. Such bonds would finance expansion of utilities, but Guam’s weak economy and poor financial manage- ment would at times limit the island’s bond ratings and ability to float issues.</p>
                <p>Revenue for Guam is gained by keeping the feder- al income taxes paid by all nonresident U.S. federal and military personnel on active duty or retired on the island as well as fees from customs, passports, immigration, and so on. This revenue, called Sec- tion 30 money from the Organic Act provision, is “covered” over (that is, transferred directly) to the Treasury of Guam instead of going to the IRS. Since the military population on Guam has been substan- tial over the years, Section 30 money has provided millions of dollars annually to GovGuam.</p>
                <p>Guam’s economy is also assisted by the island’s status under the Organic Act as a duty-free port; that is, like a number of other U.S. free ports, Guam is not part of the customs area of the United States. The First Guam Legislature abolished all customs taxes for the island, and businesses import goods free of U.S. tariffs. This benefit was of limited impact as long as the military security clearance curbed commerce until 1962. Thereafter, duty-free status boosted tourism.</p>
                <p>The Military Role and Land: Even though Gov- Guam assumed civil jurisdiction over the island in 1950, the U.S. military presence on the island re- mained overwhelming, and much of the local post- war history of the island revolved around attempts by civilians to obtain what the military was sup- posed to give them under the Organic Act. A pri-</p>
                <p>212</p>
                <p>mary problem was that all nonresidents still had to obtain a security clearance to visit the island, just as for a military base.</p>
                <p>Arnold Leibowitz, a legal scholar on U.S. territo- rial law, described the adverse impact of the secu- rity clearance: “By limiting the availability of skilled personnel, especially in the civilian construction market, just when Guam was attempting to rebuild from the destruction of World War II, the Executive Order [for the security clearance] effectively pre- vented economic development on Guam. Once the controls were removed in 1962, a booming tourist industry arose in relation to Guam, an embarrassing indication to the Federal government of their short- sighted vision of Guam’s non-military potential.”</p>
                <p>While the military security curtain around Guam hindered commercial development, military reten- tion of land and utilities on the island caused long- term problems for the private sector on Guam. The Organic Act required all property, including utilities, used by the naval government for “civil affairs” to be transferred to the new civilian gov- ernment. However, Section 33 of the act gave the U.S. president the extraordinary authority to desig- nate any part of Guam a military reservation, even if privately owned. The president also retained the power to close Guam to vessels and aircraft of for- eign nations.</p>
                <p>The navy and air force feared that transfer of all the island’s utilities to local control, particularly the generation of electric power, could jeopardize mili- tary operations. The navy, backed by the Interior Department, persuaded President Truman to use Section 33 to make a major exception to the Organ- ic Act and retain in military hands the property of installations earmarked for construction. The prop- erties the military wished to retain totaled an enor- mous 42,380 acres. They included all the major bas- es built since the war, the island’s one power plant at Piti, the Fena Naval Magazine and Reservoir, and much of the sewer, water, power, and telephone sys- tems usually considered part of “civil affairs.”</p>
                <p>To make retention of Guam’s land by the mili- tary legal, Skinner was instructed to sign a quitclaim deed on July 31, 1950—the day before the Organic</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>Act went into effect—whereby GovGuam trans- ferred all condemned properties to the United States of America “for its own use.” Truman then issued Executive Order 10178 in October 1950, which re- turned all the property in the quitclaim deed to the navy to be divided among the military services by need.</p>
                <p>These steps were taken without consulting Gua- manian officials or owners of leased properties. Interior then entered into agreement with the navy whereby the latter provided logistical support to GovGuam but retained control over all of Apra Harbor except the new Commercial Port at Ca- bras Island. This left the navy and air force in direct control of over 36 percent of the island. In short, Guamanians believed, with considerable justifica- tion, that they were fleeced of huge portions of their island.</p>
                <p>Overall, the navy and air force had little to be un- happy about with the Organic Act. The military still retained a massive presence and broad authority on Guam to accomplish its missions. The geopolitics of national defense remained paramount in U.S. policy toward Guam, as in the surrounding TTPI.</p>
                <p>Most Guamanians were pleased with the Or- ganic Act regardless of its anomalies. The islanders were Americans at last, they were participating in their own government, and military authority was curbed even though still present. The Organic Act would be amended numerous times in the com- ing decades, but its basic provisions remained es- sentially unchanged as of the year 2006 except for the military security clearance. The quality of life for Guam’s people from 1950 on was clearly better than before the Organic Act.</p>
                <p>Civilian Governors, Military Priorities</p>
                <p>During Skinner’s tenure as governor, Guam served as a busy support base for the Korean War (June 1950-July 1953). In July 1950, within two weeks of the outbreak of the war, the U.S. Air Force reac- tivated the Far East Bomber Command with B-29 bombers operating from Andersen Air Force Base (or AAFB) and North Field to bases in Japan and</p>

This treaty and its later amendments increased Guam’s importance as a support and operational base for CINCPAC’s missions in the northwestern as well as the western Pacific with long-term for- ward deployment of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in those regions.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1951, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) had allocated fifteen nuclear bombs to its wing on Guam for potential use against Soviet targets from Vladivostok to Irkutsk. In 1952, the Department of Defense was authorized for the first time to store nuclear warheads in depots outside the United States. Soon thereafter, nuclear weapons for the air force and the navy began to be stored at An- dersen and at the Fena Naval Magazine, guarded by marines.</p>
                <p>The military in this period still depended on large numbers of Filipino alien workers to complete mili- tary construction projects in the western Pacific. Control of contract workers on Guam changed as a result of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952, when the INS assumed joint administration (and later full administration) with the U.S. Navy. This act contained a provision that established three “H” worker categories, the second of which, called H-2, allowed aliens to perform “temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of perform- ing such service or labor cannot be found in the United States.”</p>
                <p>This provision allowed the military to continue to use Filipino contract workers. As of late 1952, there were still approximately 17,000 Filipino H-2 work- ers on Guam, of which 3,000 worked in local (i.e., Guamanian) defense-related businesses. The num- ber of Filipino workers dropped in the late 1950s as military projects were completed and the large labor camps closed. In 1959, responding to resolutions by the Guam Legislature to reduce the number of Filipinos, the INS ordered a three-year phase-out of alien contract laborers to begin in 1960. The Guam Chamber of Commerce, the navy, and the Interior Department all opposed this order, but the highly</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>independent INS went ahead, and by 1962 most H-2s were gone. As will be seen, however, this ac- tion only temporarily interrupted the flow of for- eign workers to the island.</p>
                <p>While these developments were unfolding on Guam, Republican Dwight Eisenhower had been elected president in November 1952. The president-elect promptly visited American troops in South Korea in early December to fulfill a campaign promise. On the way back, he landed on Guam to board the cruiser Helena for the leg to Pearl Harbor by sea. During his stay on the island, Eisenhower was told by the COMNAVMAR, Rear Admiral Ernest W. Litch, that Skinner was interfering with navy opera- tions. Litch had clashed with Skinner over the need for more electricity for the civilian sector from the navy-controlled Piti power plant. Because of the Korean War, Litch believed military needs should take priority over civilian needs.</p>
                <p>Neither Skinner (who happened to be off-island) nor his deputy Pat Herman was invited by Litch to meet Eisenhower; the trip was kept secret until the president-elect reached Guam. As a consequence of hearing only one side of the story from Litch, Eisen- hower, according to a newspaper account, “angrily ordered that Gov. Carlton Skinner...be fired after the Republican Administration takes over.” Skin- ner’s problems were compounded when Typhoon Hester struck southern Guam on New Year’s Day, 1953, and he had to ask Litch for assistance. On January 12, 1953, a Guam Daily News headline asked, “WHO RULES GUAM?” That question was answered on January 20, when Skinner resigned. He departed Guam in February, leaving Pat Herman as acting governor until Eisenhower’s new appoin- tee arrived in April.</p>
                <p>The new governor, Ford Q. Elvidge, was a Seattle attorney and contributor to Eisenhower’s campaign fund and a friend of Interior Secretary Douglas McKay. Elvidge was businesslike, stressing the need for economy and self-sufficiency (two durable chi- meras, as under the navy). Later, after leaving Guam, he wrote that he was dismayed when he arrived on the island to find trash, toads, giant snails, and</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>“hundreds of wild, abandoned dogs [that] roamed the boondocks.” He launched islandwide cleanup campaigns and initiated a GovGuam program to purchase surplus military supplies and equipment still stored in large amounts on the island.</p>
                <p>The new governor was a conservative moral- ist who prohibited gambling at the Liberation Day Festival and tried to outlaw taxi dancers. He failed to get rid of the prostitutes or the boonie dogs. He also argued repeatedly with Guam’s senators, veto- ing nine bills in 1953. In contrast, he got along well with COMNAVMAR and his staff, with whom he played golf regularly. Unlike Skinner, he was able to obtain a larger allotment of electricity from the navy for civilian consumers. Elvidge was the first governor to move into the new governor’s residence, called Government House, completed in 1954 on San Ramon hill above Agana.</p>
                <p>The Korean War ended during Elvidge’s term, but the geopolitical value of Guam did not lessen. In fact, the Department of Defense expanded Guam’s role in the new U.S. strategy of deterrence based on the threat of nuclear retaliation by long-range bombers in case of communist aggression against the United States or its allies. Andersen AFB became the chief base of SAC in the Pacific, one of thirty-eight over- seas bases that encircled the Sino-Soviet Bloc.</p>
                <p>It was during Elvidge’s administration that TTPI headquarters was transferred from Hawai‘i to Guam. The Interior Department had assumed ad- ministration of the trusteeship from the navy in 1951, but the TTPI staffs remained in Hawai‘i un- til 1954. That year, TTPI headquarters moved to Guam to a compound in Maite of wooden buildings with tar-paper roofs called the Hotel Tropics.</p>
                <p>TTPI headquarters came to Guam instead of Saipan because the Northern Mariana Islands were mysteriously removed from Interior’s jurisdiction in January 1953 and placed back under the navy. Not until years later did the public learn that the CIA, under the cover of a Naval Technical Training Unit, or NTTU, was secretly using Saipan to train foreign agents, mostly Chinese Nationalists, for sabotage missions against Asian communist nations. The CIA</p>
                <p>215</p>
                <p>constructed a huge base for the NTTU in the central mountains of Saipan. The existence of this major secret installation was one reason that the navy per- petuated the stringent security clearance for visitors to the TTPI and Guam after the Korean War ended.</p>
                <p>The NTTU supported Nationalist China’s prepa- rations to invade mainland China from Taiwan. When the invasion never took place, Washington quietly closed the NITU operation in May 1962. Interior resumed jurisdiction over Saipan and the other Northern Mariana Islands in July and moved TTPI headquarters from Guam into the fine con- crete offices and residences on Saipan formerly oc- cupied by the CIA. Guam was thus capital of two Pacific political entities from 1954 into 1962.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Guam legislature became the focus of lively local electoral politics. Some 65 percent of Guam’s eligible voters cast ballots in the first legislative election (there were no primaries in this period) under the Organic Act in November 1950. High voter participation would be character- istic of Guam’s regular elections from then on. Poli- tics became one of the most popular activities on the island, with Guamanians tending to vote in family blocs through the Chamorro pare system for promi- nent persons who functioned as patrones to provide GovGuam jobs with retirement benefits.</p>
                <p>In the 1950 election, the new Popular Party un- der Tony Won Pat’s leadership handily defeated the candidates of the Welfare Party. The defeat caused the frustrated Welfare Party to disband in early 1952, and some of its leaders joined the Popular Party, but they remained unhappy. In the 1952 and 1954 elections, the Popular Party again won most of the seats, except for a few lost to independents, and Won Pat was elected speaker each time.</p>
                <p>A revolt erupted within the Popular Party in early 1955 when eight incumbent members in the legislature broke away to establish a separate vot- ing bloc with three independents. The dissidents in- cluded some disgruntled former Welfare Party mem- bers and were led by prominent manak‘kilo family heads such as Eduardo T. Calvo, Frank D. Perez, and B. J. Bordallo. With a narrow majority of eleven votes, they elected F.B. Leon Guerrero as speaker of</p>
                <p>216</p>
                <p>the Third Guam Legislature, deposing Won Pat from that position. The rebels then formed the Territorial Party a few months before the 1956 election. While local politics preoccupied the Guamanians, Gover- nor Elvidge resigned a year early in May 1956.</p>
                <p>As a result of the Territorial Party’s formation, the 1956 election for the Fourth Guam Legislature turned into a wide-open political contest on Guam. Popular Party Senator James T. Sablan (a Protes- tant) led the assault on the Territorials nightly at fiesta-like political rallies called gupot in Chamor- ro. According to Guam historian Pedro Sanchez, Sa- blan’s harangues “ranged from the hilarious use of the Chamorro and English languages to malicious attacks on his opponents.” He and other Popular Party candidates criticized the Territorials as the “party of the rich” who represented the old privi- leged manak‘kilo class (and, tacitly, the Catholic Church). Democracy, with electoral mudslinging beneath its idealism, had at last come to Guam.</p>
                <p>The Popular Party won all twenty-one seats in 1956 in what was called a Blackjack victory (for the card game). One of the new senators was Ricky Bordallo, a son of elder statesman B. J. Bordallo, who retired that year. The Popular Party went on to dominate the 1958, 1960, and 1962 elections, with Won Pat elected speaker each time. In 1960, the party changed its name to the Democratic Party of Guam and formally affiliated with the national Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>While local politics bubbled along in the legisla- tive and village commissioner elections, Governor Elvidge’s successor, Richard Barratt Lowe, arrived in October 1956. The new governor had served on Tinian in World War II as a naval officer and was governor of American Samoa from 1953 until his appointment to Guam. Conservative in outlook, he compared the U.S.-Guam relationship to that of fa- ther and child. He upheld navy control of utilities but did not get along with the Interior Department. One of his first actions was to establish the position of assistant secretary of Guam, to which he named a popular Chamorro senator, Manuel Flores Leon Guerrero (nicknamed “Carson” Guerrero).</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>In the mid-1950s, the economy of Guam settled down to routine but respectable development after the postwar boom ended. In August 1956, radio sta- tion KUAM brought television broadcasts to Guam on tapes, usually a week or more old. Because lots in Agana were still tied up in controversies, com- mercial development was spreading northward along Marine Drive, gradually making Tamuning the island’s business center. In August 1957, the new, multistory Guam Memorial Hospital (GMH) building was dedicated at Oka a mile east of the old site. The new GMH would prove to be poor- ly designed and inadequate as the island popula- tion grew. The year 1957 was also when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the globe. Sputnik jolted the world into the space age and catapulted the Soviet Union and the United States into a missile race that would magnify Guam’s role in U.S. national defense as a station for tracking missiles and satellites.</p>
                <p>Governor Lowe’s relationship with the navy was cordial from 1956 to 1958 while Rear Admi- ral W.B.Ammon was COMNAVMAR. Ammon’s replacement, however, was “six feet four inches of red-faced belligerent pomposity,” according to Lowe. The new COMNAVMAR, Rear Admiral W.L. (Skee) Erdmann, attempted to reassert naval authority over the civilian government. He criticized GovGuam officials, requested a special school for military dependents, snubbed Lowe, and prohibited navy personnel from attending some local public events. Lowe asked that Erdmann be recalled, but the navy refused, and the irascible admiral outlasted the governor, who resigned in frustration a year ear- ly in November 1959.</p>
                <p>Lowe had the last laugh, however, when Erd- mann subsequently left Guam in 1960 to retire. The admiral exercised military RHIP (Rank Hath Its Privileges) by smuggling forty-two cases of duty-free whiskey—purchased at the Guam naval PX—into California with his household effects. Caught and indicted, he pleaded guilty with tears in his eyes. He was fined $15,000 but did not lose his navy retire- ment benefits.</p>
                <p>In 1959, when Lowe was preparing to resign the</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>governorship, he recommended that Joseph Flores, the publisher of the Guam Daily News, be appointed to replace him. After a delay due to the reluctance of Flores to take the job, he was appointed and sworn in on the Plaza de Espafia in July 1960. He was the first governor of Chamorro origin since the “acting governors” in the interregnum of 1898-1899.</p>
                <p>When the territories of Alaska and Hawai‘i be- came U.S. states in 1958 and 1959, respectively, po- litical leaders and public opinion on Guam began to consider more seriously the issues of self-deter- mination and political status for the island. Arnold Leibowitz, a legal expert on U.S. territories, later wrote in the context of the Alaskan and Hawaiian examples, “Statehood is clearly the goal [for Guam] if it could be obtained.” The reaction of the Interior Department, however, was to stiffen its oversight of the remaining territories by “oversnoopervision,” according to Lowe.</p>
                <p>Richard Lowe’s legacy included the first book written by an American governor about his admin- istration of the island. Titled Problems in Paradise, the 1967 book covered Lowe’s tenure on American Samoa as well as on Guam. He wrote, “I think the time has come to give consideration to the granting of limited commonwealth status to both Guam and the Virgin Islands by providing for an elected del- egate and an elected governor in both territories.” This was the first mention of commonwealth status for Guam by a U.S. official.</p>
                <p>Guam’s new governor, Joseph Flores, had been one of a handful of Chamorro men allowed to enlist in the regular navy on Guam during World War I. He served in the navy five years, becoming an American citizen, and then prospered in publishing in Cali- fornia for the next thirty years before returning to Guam in 1947 and buying the Guam Daily News. Successful in business, active in civic, veteran, and church affairs, he had the reliable, conservative qualities sought by the Republican administration in Washington.</p>
                <p>Under Flores in 1960, Pan Am inaugurated east- west jet airline service across the Pacific via Guam in Boeing 707 airliners. Also in 1960, the U.S. Con-</p>
                <p>217</p>
                <p>gress extended the Social Security system to Guam. With the gradual expansion of island commerce, the Bank of Hawaii was licensed in February 1961 to operate on Guam in competition with the Bank of America. By then Guam’s economy, but not its envi- ronment, appeared fully recovered from the devas- tation of World War II.</p>
                <p>The navy in 1960 used the Naval Station at Apra Harbor to support a remarkable scientific feat. From Guam, the navy transported the civilian deep- sea submersible Trieste to the Marianas Trench, 220 miles southwest of the island, where on January 20, 1960, Jacques Piccard and Lt. Donald Walsh, USN, descended in the submersible to a depth of 35,840 feet, a world record. The dive was in an area called the Challenger Deep, the deepest known place on earth. No one has since dived deeper. Their record still stands.</p>
                <p>In 1961, land transportation improved on Guam when the Department of Public Works asphalted the Agat-Umatac road for the first time. Back in 1945, the Seabees had cut a dirt road through the steep hills south of Agat to Umatac (there had never been a real road, only paths, over these hills under the Spaniards). Rain, however, repeatedly washed away parts of the Seabee track. The asphalting of this segment finally completed an all-weather highway around the island after sixty-three years of Ameri- can administration.</p>
                <p>The alien labor situation was altered in 1960, when the “Aquino Ruling” (based on a U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals case) permitted some non- immigrant alien workers admitted to Guam prior to December 1952 and still on the island owing to contract employment to remain as permanent U.S. residents. By February 1962, about 1,700 Filipino nonimmigrant aliens were able to obtain permanent residence on Guam. Along with other Filipino con- tract workers who had married American citizens, these H-2 workers admitted as residents eventually became American citizens by applying for a “green card.” Once U.S. citizens, Filipinos who remained on Guam (many departed for Hawai‘i or the main- land) in turn petitioned for family members in the Philippines to enter Guam and apply to become U.S.</p>
                <p>218</p>
                <p>citizens. Over the years, this flow of immigrants to Guam outside the regular U.S. immigrant quota for the Philippines gathered momentum (and continues today) to the point where Americans of Filipino ori- gin became the largest ethnic minority on Guam, with about one-quarter of the island’s population.</p>
                <p>Despite the phase-out of the H-2 program, man- ual laborers were still needed for military construc- tion as Guamanians continued to shun such work. As a result, H-2 workers were replaced by a new category, the Defense Parolee Program under the provisions of the 1952 Immigration and Naturaliza- tion Act. Unlike H-2 workers, parolees had to work under the old discriminatory low wage scales, thus providing military contractors a supply of cheap alien labor for U.S. defense purposes as before.</p>
                <p>In education, Governor Flores supported the appointment in 1957 of the first Chamorro to be dean of the Territorial College of Guam (there was no president at the time). This was Pedro C. San- chez, who had a doctoral degree in education from Stanford University and was the son of the respect- ed Chamorro educator Simon A. Sanchez. At the time, Dr. Sanchez and Paul Carano were researching a book, A Complete History of Guam, published in 1964. It would serve as a valuable text for high school and college classes for the next twenty years. The college moved in 1960 from Mongmong to its present magnificent cliffside site in Mangilao over- looking Pago Bay, and in 1961 the school became a four-year undergraduate institution.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Democrat John Fitzgerald Kennedy had won the 1960 U.S. presidential election against Republican Richard M. Nixon, so Flores, a Repub- lican, submitted his resignation. The next gover- nor, Texan William P. (Bill) Daniel, was appointed through the influence of fellow Texan Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy’s vice president, and Price Dan- iel, Bill’s brother and former Democratic governor of Texas. Bill Daniel was inaugurated in May 1961, with Manuel Flores Leon Guerrero as secretary of Guam.</p>
                <p>Daniel renamed the governor’s residence “the Governor’s Palace.” He wore gaudy country-west-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>ern clothes at public functions and rode a big white horse named Alamo, unwittingly reminding Gua- manians of the haughty Spanish governors in the old Juan Malo stories. In a well-publicized effort to improve island agriculture, he launched Opera- tion Guam Friendship, whereby he persuaded state- side friends and Texas farmers to donate animals to Guam’s Department of Agriculture. Bulls, stal- lions, milk goats, boars, and even Texas armadil- los arrived (the latter soon disappeared, presumably eaten).</p>
                <p>The natural courtesy of the islanders kept them at first from publicly criticizing this Texan bull in their island china shop, but eventually voices were raised. Karl R. Anderson wrote in January 1962 in the Guam Daily News, “Your attempt to better Guam would fare much better if, somehow, you could lose the idea that you are dealing with an inferior breed of people.” Complaints did not faze Daniel. In a last escapade in 1962, he sought to obtain three fur pieces for his wife from Chinese furrier Peter Chang in Agana. The governor offered to pay for one piece and keep the other two as “gifts.” When Chang re- quested full payment, the burly Daniel choked the furrier by his tie. Chang then lodged a complaint with the police. Faced with this embarrassment, Daniel resigned in September 1962, to the relief of Guamanians, but President Kennedy did not accept the resignation until January 1963. Daniel mean- while embarked on a round-the-world tour as a self-proclaimed “goodwill ambassador” for Guam while he continued to draw his governor’s salary for four more months.</p>
                <p>The major policy accomplishment of Bill Daniel on Guam was to help get rid of the navy security clearance. He requested Secretary of the Navy John Connally—a personal friend and fellow Texan—to lift the clearance. With the Korean War long over and the NTTU base on Saipan closed, there was no further need for the clearance. In August 1962, President Kennedy discontinued the security clear- ance for Guam. Finally free of this military shackle, Guam could begin normal development of its pri- vate sector.</p>

                <p>Guamanian Governors, Civilian Priorities</p>
                <p>After Daniel departed, Manuel Flores Leon Guer- rero was left in charge until a new governor was selected. Leon Guerrero had first made his mark when he served as the chair of the rules commit- tee in the First Guam Legislature in 1951-1952. He subsequently served in several executive branch positions before surviving seventeen months as sec- retary of Guam under Daniel. The island was fortu- nate to have the experienced, patient Leon Guerrero as its leader when on the night of November 11-12, 1962, Supertyphoon Karen smashed into the island.</p>
                <p>At her peak, Karen’s sustained winds rose to an estimated 173 miles per hour (the navy’s anemom- eter broke at 144 m.p.h.), punctuated by gusts up to 207 m.p.h. Atmospheric pressure fell so fast (to 27.05 inches from the normal 29.92 inches on the barometer) that doors and windows, and some en- tire rickety buildings, exploded outward. The eye of this awesome storm swept swiftly across Guam from east to west over Umatac, with the strongest winds on the northern arc over Agana and Apra Harbor.</p>
                <p>Amazingly, only nine people were killed by Kar- en, thanks to early warnings by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center on Guam (the JTWC had been es- tablished in 1959 by combining navy and air force weather efforts) and to the fact that the storm struck at night when nearly everyone was inside. Leon Guerrero declared martial law and asked for fed- eral assistance while he organized relief efforts. In his report to the secretary of the interior, the acting governor wrote, “Over 90 percent of the island’s buildings were destroyed or badly damaged... . Fol- lowing the storm the island defied description as every tree, every blade of grass had been beaten to brown, shriveled masses.... Damage from the storm ran well over $100 million.”</p>
                <p>Within hours after the storm ended, President Kennedy (who was still coping with the October Cuban missile crisis at the time) declared Guam a major disaster area. He authorized $16 million for immediate relief. COMNAVMAR immediately au- thorized military assistance for civilians. GovGuam and military personnel erected tents for the hun-</p>
                <p>219</p>
                <p>dreds of people whose homes were wiped out. Act- ing Governor Leon Guerrero’s leadership impressed federal officials and led to his nomination by Inte- rior Secretary Stewart Udall to replace Daniel (who tried to return to Guam when he learned of Karen but was dissuaded for fear that he might prolong the disaster). Leon Guerrero was sworn in as gover- nor in March 1963.</p>
                <p>No sooner had Leon Guerrero moved into the governor’s residence (the name of which he changed back to Government House) when another ty- phoon—Olive—lashed Guam in April 1963, un- doing much of the reconstruction accomplished in the five months since Karen. Kennedy once more declared the island a disaster area and sent more help. These two natural disasters turned out to be the means for over a decade of massive capital im- provements on Guam. Leon Guerrero flew to Wash- ington, D.C., where, assisted by fellow Chamorro Richard EF. (Dick) Taitano, who was then director of territories in the Interior Department, he obtained a big financial package from the Congress under the Guam Rehabilitation Act in November 1963, which provided $45 million in federal funds, partly as a grant and with about 60 percent as a loan.</p>
                <p>This act was the last signed by President Kennedy to assist Guam. The island’s people, along with the rest of the nation, were stunned at the news of Ken- nedy’s assassination in November 1963 while the president was driving through Dallas with John Connally, by then governor of Texas, and their wives. Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson, con- tinued the generous federal financial support of Guam.</p>
                <p>To provide labor needed for rehabilitation, the INS permitted Filipino workers (and several hun- dred Micronesians for the first time) into Guam under a second parolee program, the Reconstruc- tion and Rehabilitation Program, on six-month contracts, which were extended until May 1970. The number of alien workers on Guam began to rise again, to nearly 4,500 by the end of 1967. These workers continued to be exploited by being given poor food and forced to suffer “filth and squa- lor...in living quarters,” according to one report.</p>

                <p>Governor and Mrs. Manuel Flores Leon Guerrero. A Democrat, Manuel Flores Leon Guerrero was appointed governor of Guam by President John F. Kennedy in March 1963 and served the people of Guam with poise for over six years until 1969, when he was replaced by Carlos Garcia Camacho, a Republican ap- pointed by President Richard M. Nixon.

                <p>The abuses by American businessmen resulted in the formation in December 1964 of the first labor union on Guam, the Operating Engineers Union Lo- cal 3 of the AFL-CIO, with 1,500 (mostly Filipino) members. Local 3 was followed in April 1965 by the creation of an American Federation of Teachers unit on Guam, the Guam Federation of Teachers (GFT) Local 1581, which within a few years became the island’s largest union. The teachers were employ- ees of GovGuam, which would lead to clashes over salaries in the coming years.</p>
                <p>The Guam Department of Labor was assigned to investigate contract labor problems with the Filipino workers but proved incapable of prevent- ing abuses then or when such exploitation occurred repeatedly in the future. The abuses prompted the</p>

                <p>Philippine government under President Ferdinand Marcos to complain. “MARCOS THREATENS LEGAL ACTION AGAINST LABOR CONTRAC- TORS HERE” was the headline in the Pacific Jour- nal on February 20, 1968. The Philippine consulate was upgraded to a consulate general, and the prob- lems were patched over but only temporarily. Because of economic growth in the mid-1960s as a result of federal rehabilitation funds as well as the surge in Vietnam-related military projects, the need for outside labor grew beyond the parolee pro- grams. Consequently, the INS reinstituted the H-2 program on Guam in early 1969. Parolee workers were phased out in 1970, with many converting to H-2 status, under which they were paid higher wag- es when in the late 1960s the U.S. Fair Labor Stan-</p>

                <p>dards Act applied the U.S. minimum wage ($2.03 per hour in 1969) to nonimmigrant alien contract laborers.</p>
                <p>The reinstated H-2 system opened up Guam to the fourth wave of Filipinos (and later other na- tionalities) in the island’s history. The first influx had been Filipino soldiers with the Spanish inva- sion in 1668-1698, many of whom were absorbed into Chamorro society. The second wave was the deportados and convicts in the 1860s-1890s. The third wave came in the late 1940s into the 1950s as military contract workers. The fourth influx, mostly H-2 workers, came in the 1960s before ebbing in the mid-1970s when a recession hit Guam. In the 1990s, the flow of nonimmigrant workers dwindled significantly when Guam fell into a prolonged eco- nomic recession. Each of these waves left workers behind, either legally or illegally, adding to Guam’s multiethnic population.</p>
                <p>With the infusion of federal money into Guam in the 1960s, Leon Guerrero launched extensive urban renewal programs beyond what existed before Kar- en. New homes and other buildings were required to be constructed of reinforced concrete block walls on concrete foundations under concrete slab roofs with wide overhangs. This pillbox style, still preva- lent on Guam, provides protection from typhoons. GovGuam land was provided at nominal cost to private developers to build low-cost concrete hous- es in new village sections called Kaiser subdivisions for the Kaiser Company, which constructed them along with the Black Construction Company. In 1965, the Office of Land Management completed an islandwide land-use plan, the first of several such plans, none of which would be implemented fully over the next twenty-five years owing to inaction by the legislature, which wished to control land mat- ters itself.</p>
                <p>While post-Karen reconstruction was under way, the Seventh Guam Legislature passed a law intro- duced by Senator Ricky Bordallo for an official Washington representative to act as liaison between the Guam Legislature and the U.S. Congress. Back in 1953, the legislature had transmitted the first of</p>
                <p>221</p>
                <p>several petitions to the Congress to authorize a del- egate, but the Interior Department repeatedly shot down the requests. Interior argued that approval of a Guam delegate would make the island an incor- porated territory, which implied eventual statehood contrary to the understanding behind the Organic Act. Frustrated, the Guam legislature in 1964 creat- ed an unofficial nonvoting delegate to the Congress. It would prove to be a wise step.</p>
                <p>In a close special election in March 1965 for the delegate’s job, Democratic leader Tony Won Pat won. He would be reelected to the Washington, D.C., position again in 1968. He was just a lobby- ist, but he shrewdly acted as if, in his words, “the incumbent was in fact a Member of Congress in ev- erything but the name—and the power.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime, legislative politics took a twist when the Democratic Party lost the majority in the November 1964 election for the Eighth Guam Leg- islature. Among the new Territorial senators were Carlos Garcia Camacho and Paul McDonald Calvo (son of Eduardo T. Calvo), both future governors, and Kurt S. Moylan, a future lieutenant governor. Former island leader EB.Leon Guerrero was no longer running for public office; he suffered a stroke in 1962 and passed away in 1974.</p>
                <p>The Territorial senators—with a thirteen to eight margin in seats—blocked the Democrat-supported urban renewal program of Governor Leon Guer- rero. The Territorials preferred to promote private investment. In November 1965, they established the Guam Economic Development Authority (GEDA) to provide loans and issue “QCs” (qualifying cer- tificates) to investors with tax rebates on corporate income for up to twenty years, plus abatement of other taxes. GEDA was authorized to issue bonds for the financing of businesses. The interest on these “project revenue bonds” is tax exempt and thus can be issued at interest below commercial rates. The tax-exempt bonds, QCs, and other benefits became incentives for Japanese investors to set up hotels on Guam.</p>
                <p>In the 1966 elections, however, urban renewal was the big issue, not GEDA, with the Democrats blasting the Territorials for blocking the popular</p>
                <p>222</p>
                <p>renewal program. To the shock of the Territorials, the Democratic Party won all twenty-one seats in another Blackjack landslide. Crushed, the Territo- rial Party soon dissolved, and some of its members, led by Carlos Camacho, Joseph Flores, and Kurt Moylan, formed the Republican Party in Novem- ber 1966. With a Democratic majority, the Ninth Guam Legislature reinstated Leon Guerrero’s urban renewal program.</p>
                <p>The surge of construction that resulted from the infusion of federal rehabilitation money in the 1960s after Karen invigorated business activity through- out the island. In 1963, Governor Leon Guerrero formed a tourist commission and with commend- able foresight launched a determined effort to at- tract visitors to Guam. In 1965, when some 5,000 tourists—mostly stateside Americans on their way elsewhere—were stopping on the island, there were only about seventy hotel rooms, mostly in the Cliff Hotel at the foot of San Ramon Hill above Agana. In April 1966, QC-supported construction began on the first of Tumon’s luxury hotels, the Guam Hilton with 200 rooms.</p>
                <p>To accommodate increased tourism, the new Guam International Air Terminal was dedicated in March 1966 at the Tiyan Naval Air Station on the opposite side of the runway from the navy’s facili- ties. In 1967, the Federal Aviation Authority rec- ognized a new airline, Continental-Air Micronesia. Known as “Air Mike,” it became the main regional carrier when tourists were permitted into the TTPI in 1968 and the Japanese rediscovered Guam. In 1969, nearly 58,000 Japanese arrived, filling the 1,000 hotel rooms that existed by then. In Octo- ber 1970, Japanese Airlines (JAL) initiated regular flights between Tokyo and Guam on DC-8 jets, as would Korean Airlines later. From then on, develop- ment of Guam’s private sector was tied to tourism.</p>
                <p>Civil air transportation boosted the island econo- my, but Guam remained dependent on U.S. shipping for bulk imports within the restrictions of the 1927 Jones Act. An example of that dependency occurred in 1967 when the U.S.-flagged freighter Guam Bear struck the Apra Harbor breakwater and sank. For years afterwards, whenever a store on Guam was</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>short of goods, the excuse to unhappy customers was “It’s the Guam Bear’s fault.”</p>
                <p>By the late 1960s, the Americanization of Guam was becoming irreversible through the spread of American media and cultural values. In 1970, Jo- seph Flores sold Guam’s main newspaper, the Guam Daily News, to Hawaiian millionaire Chin Ho, who changed the paper’s name to the Pacific Daily News (PDN). Chin Ho hired a witty skeptic, Robert Udick, as publisher and retained as editor Joe Murphy, who in addition to editing the paper after 1965 wrote a daily column, “Pipe Dreams.” In 1971, Chin Ho sold the paper to Gannett, a huge mainland U.S. newspaper chain, with Lee Webber serving as an effective and reliable publisher.</p>
                <p>Local Guam matters, however, were overshadowed by dramatic regional and world developments in the 1960s. By this period, the worldwide U.S. military strategy against the Soviet Union and its allies was governed by the Single Integrated Operational Plan, SIOP for short. This top-secret plan coordinated the three strategic U.S. nuclear weapons systems, each capable of delivering megatons of thermonuclear destruction: long-range bombers under SAC con- trol, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) under the navy, and intercontinental ballistic mis- siles (ICBMs) also under SAC. Guam was the only place where two of these deadly strategic weapons systems—bombers and SLBMs—out of the three, all armed with nuclear warheads, were located to- gether in a small area.</p>
                <p>In March 1964, SAC stationed B-52 bombers on Guam accompanied by KC-135 tankers for air refueling. Beginning the same year, Polaris SLBMs were deployed to Apra Harbor aboard submarines serviced by the tender USS Proteus in 1964. Up to twelve Polaris submarines, and later the larger Po- seidon missile versions along with smaller attack submarines, operated for the next twenty years out of Apra Harbor.</p>
                <p>When the Proteus arrived at Guam, a Soviet “fish- ing” trawler took up station in international waters off Ritidian Point. This electronic spy ship moni- tored American submarine patrols and B-52 take-</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>offs. The Soviet ship was relieved by another out of Vladivostok every six weeks or so until the surveil- lance ended in the 1980s. At times, the crews of the spy ships exchanged Russian vodka for American cigarettes with Chamorros fishing in small boats, as did the crews of Spanish galleons before them.</p>
                <p>In addition to the strategic nuclear weapons sys- tems on Guam in the 1950s and 1960s, both the navy and the air force maintained aviation squad- rons on the island for medical evacuations, com- munications with submarines, weather reconnais- sance, airborne early warning, and joint search and rescue (SAR) missions in conjunction with the two ships of the U.S. Coast Guard based on Guam. By the 1970s, the navy was using the reliable P-3 Orion aircraft (with a distinctive tail projection like a stinger that is a magnetic anomaly detector to locate submarines). Defense facilities that ap- peared on the island in the 1960s included the Pa- cific barrier radar network, dishes for tracking and telemetric control of satellites, a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) station at Dandan, a sound surveillance system (SOSUS) of underwater hydrophones arrayed across the western Pacific out of a top-secret building called NavFac (for Naval Facility) at Ritidian Point, and National Security Agency (NSA) installations for signal intelligence gathering (SIGINT) at the NAVCAMS Finagayan master communications station, where a huge circu- lar “elephant cage” antenna occupies several acres of ground to listen to radio and telephone transmis- sions across Asia. Many of these facilities remain along with new ones (notably a State Department communications facility at Dandan) despite the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s.</p>
                <p>While Guam was fulfilling its geopolitical role in the 1960s, a regional political metamorphosis was occurring in the surrounding TTPI. The Congress of Micronesia, a bicameral legislature of elected rep- resentatives from all the TTPI districts, was estab- lished in late 1964. By 1966, the Micronesians were pressing the United States for a change in their po- litical status to end the UN trusteeship. This trans- formation—the decolonization of the TTPI—would eventually have a powerful effect on Guam’s politi-</p>
                <p>223</p>
                <p>cal development, but of more immediate impact on Guam was the cancerlike growth of the Vietnam conflict into a full-scale war in the 1960s.</p>
                <p>Guam served first as a support base for the Amer- ican advisers dispatched to South Vietnam by Presi- dent Kennedy, beginning in 1962. This role was broadened in mid-1965 to include combat opera- tions by B-52s from Andersen AFB after U.S. ground combat units were deployed in South Vietnam. In June 1965, twenty-seven bombers of the Third Air Division at Andersen launched the first of thou- sands of conventional “iron bomb” strikes against Viet Cong targets in Vietnam. The entire north of Guam turned into a hornet’s nest of intense activity as the numbers of air force personnel, aircraft, and facilities rapidly expanded over the next few years. The B-52s at Andersen AFB also maintained their SIOP ready-alert status with thermonuclear hydro- gen bombs in case of war with the Soviet Union or China.</p>
                <p>While the Vietnam War ground on with mount- ing bloodshed, politics went on as usual on Guam. Back in 1962, the Sixth Guam Legislature started sending pleas to the Congress to authorize a locally elected governor. Various bills for the same purpose were introduced but died in committee. Instead of hiring public relations firms, lobbyists, or attorneys, the Guamanians placed full-page ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post (newspapers read by most U.S. congressmen) in support of an elected governor. Won Pat also lobbied ardently for the measure.</p>
                <p>These efforts culminated in the Guam Elective Governor Act, which Congress passed in September 1968. This law amended the Guam Organic Act to permit elections by the people of Guam, beginning in 1970, of a governor and lieutenant governor ev- ery four years with a limit of two successive terms. One welcome provision in the act specifically ap- plied the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitu- tion to the people of Guam.</p>
                <p>Guamanian elation over the Elective Governor Act was tempered by one provision that gave au- thority to the Interior Department’s comptroller to</p>
                <p>224</p>
                <p>audit all accounts, including taxes, of GovGuam. This federal audit was in addition to the require- ment for the governor’s annual financial report to the Interior Department. Most Guamanians view these “watchdog” audits as unwarranted federal intrusions into local affairs. Interior has no such authority in the U.S. states or in Puerto Rico. Is- land leaders were so upset that the Ninth Guam Legislature took out a critical full-page ad in the Washington Post and recessed one week in protest. Nevertheless, GovGuam has not been able to elimi- nate the federal audits, which are now conducted out of the Inspector General’s office in the Interior Department.</p>
                <p>While the Elective Governor Act was being legis- lated, the Ninth Guam Legislature approved a bill in August 1968 introduced by Democratic Senator Dick Taitano to create Guam’s first constitutional convention. With Antonio M. (Tony) Palomo as president, forty-three elected delegates met from June 1969 to June 1970. The convention did not draft a full constitution. Instead, it proposed thirty- four changes to the Guam Organic Act. The propos- als were transmitted to the U.S. Congress, but it was the wrong time for such initiatives. Washington was obsessed with Vietnam, and the Guamanian people were preoccupied with their first-ever elections for governor in 1970. As a result, and owing mostly to Won Pat’s persistence, only one major convention proposal would eventually be approved: the autho- rization of a nonvoting official Guam delegate to the Congress in 1972.</p>
                <p>National U.S. elections had taken place in the meantime in November 1968, and Republican Richard Nixon was elected president. Governor Leon Guerrero, a Democrat, submitted his courtesy resignation, which was accepted. The modest but effective Leon Guerrero was a good man. He had served Guam ably as governor for six years and four months, the longest tenure of any governor until then since the Spanish era.</p>
                <p>Nixon’s appointee as replacement for Leon Guer- rero was local Republican leader Carlos Garcia Camacho. He was forty-four years old and had served as a dentist with the rank of captain in the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 13</p>
                <p>U.S. Army. Nixon appointed Kurt Moylan, only thirty-one years old, to be secretary of Guam. The appointments were confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June 1969.</p>
                <p>After appointing Camacho, Nixon flew to Guam on an around-the-world trip that included watching the splashdown in the Pacific of Apollo XI, the first moon vehicle. At a July 1969 news conference at the Top-of-the-Mar naval officers’ club on Nimitz Hill, the president announced a new U.S. foreign policy, the Guam Doctrine, also called the Nixon Doctrine. He said that American troops would no longer be sent abroad to fight for nations threatened by ag- gression; those nations would have to assume their own defense with American help other than ground troops. Later presidents would discard this doc- trine, but the immediate result was that B-52 mis- sions from Guam increased in tempo and ferocity. The air force built three tent cities on Andersen AFB to accommodate enlisted crews of additional B-52s, while officers filled the new Tumon hotels.</p>
                <p>By then Guam was one of the few communities in the United States where the majority of Americans still loyally supported the war in Vietnam. A total of seventy-four servicemen from Guam would die there. In December 1969, Governor Camacho flew to Vietnam for a five-day visit over Christmas with gifts for Guamanian servicemen. Johnny G. Sablan, a popular Chamorro singer, was part of the gover- nor’s entourage. The war was going badly since the Viet Cong’s Tet Offensive in early 1968, and Cama- cho’s visit was a tangible gesture of home support. The troops from Guam welcomed their governor warmly with minifiestas, complete with Chamorro songs and food of red rice, roast pork, and kelaguen (marinated raw meat or fish in grated coconut) with spicy finadene sauce. His 1969 visit to Vietnam boosted Camacho’s popularity, which he carried into the fall 1970 elections.</p>
                <p>The 1970 elections included September primaries for the first time, and nearly every adult on Guam was emotionally absorbed in the first-ever local gu- bernatorial race. Camacho initially picked Senator G. Ricardo Salas, a prominent Chamorro politician, as running mate, but they soon squabbled and Salas</p>
                <p>UNDER THE ORGANIC ACT 1950-1970</p>
                <p>was dumped in favor of Kurt Moylan. The Cama- cho-Moylan ticket ran unopposed in the primary, which turned out to be a smart move on the part of the Republicans.</p>
                <p>The Democrats in the meantime were splitting into three factions. Former governor Leon Guer- rero led one ticket with running mate Dr. Antonio C. (Tony) Yamashita, who resigned from his posi- tion as president of the University of Guam (the College of Guam had been elevated by the legisla- ture to university status in 1968). The second Dem- ocratic ticket in the primary was that of Senators Ricky Bordallo and Dick Taitano. Bordallo was a loquacious, energetic populist, while Taitano was a respected former director of the Office of Territo- ries and deputy high commissioner of the TTPI. The third Democratic ticket was headed by Joaquin Ca- macho Arriola, an outgoing lawyer and speaker of the Ninth Guam Legislature, who ran with Vicente Bamba, a newly retired judge and popular former senator.</p>
                <p>In the lively campaigning for the primary, Dick Taitano created Guam’s first islandwide grass- roots political organization throughout the villages, working with family networks through the pare sys- tem to socialize voters into Democratic Party poli- tics. The Bordallo-Taitano campaign also benefited from the zeal and blonde charm of Madeleine Zeien Bordallo, Ricky’s statesider wife. Arriola took the boldest position on issues. He proclaimed the here- tofore unspoken opposition of Guamanians of Cha- morro descent against the flow of Filipino workers</p>
                <p>225</p>
                <p>(he called them “transient aliens”) into Guam. Ar- riola promised to stop the inflow, which many Cha- morros perceived to be a threat to Chamorro cul- ture and control of their island.</p>
                <p>The Arriola initiative boomeranged, costing his ticket Filipino and statesider votes without swing- ing Chamorro voters away from the other tickets. Bordallo-Taitano came in first in the Democratic primary by a close margin over Leon Guerrero- Yamashita, but neither ticket won a majority. After a contentious campaign of two weeks, Bordallo- Taitano won the runoff, but the infighting left the Democratic Party divided. As a result, Republicans Camacho-Moylan won the general election in No- vember 1970.</p>
                <p>The year 1970 also marked a major change in the Catholic community on Guam when Bishop Baumgartner had a stroke and died in December. His work was assumed by Monsignor Felixberto Camacho Flores, who on May 7, 1971, was con- secrated as the first Chamorro bishop. Bishop Baumgartner had served the people of Guam with distinction and love for twenty-five years, the lon- gest tenure of a bishop in Guam’s history. During that time, he built many schools and churches, re- constructed the Agana Cathedral, and in 1965 saw his vicariate raised to the Diocese of Agana. He was buried in his cathedral. As the decade of the 1970s began, Guam’s government and main religion were both again in Chamorro hands for the first time in over 300 years.</p>

                <p>Chamorro Politics, American Acculturation</p>
                <p>The election of Carlos Camacho in 1970 was the first occasion in Guam’s postcontact history where- in the people of the island chose their own chief ex- ecutive of government. Guam was thus internally self-governing to a large degree but still fell short of United Nations criteria of full self-government. Be- cause the people of the island did not vote on either the 1950 Organic Act or the 1968 Elective Gover- nor Act, Guam remained a colony (or a neo-colony, according to some commentators) of the United States.</p>
                <p>Much of what remained of the customs of the tra- ditional Chamorro culture—such as the language, marriages, family ties, and retention of land, all known as kustumbren Chamoru—were being al- tered by Americanization, by development, and by tourism. The use of pattera midwives decreased dra- matically after World War II, as did the tradition of informal adoption of children by godparents and other family members (called poksai in Chamorro) as more and more families lived in separate houses after marriage. A cultural watershed was passed when by the 1970s English replaced Chamorro as the main language in a majority of island homes. The American presence permeated the island with music, words, and images. Protestant denomina- tions, including Episcopalians, Seventh-Day Adven- tists, Lutherans, and Mormons, established church-</p>
                <p>226</p>
                <p>es and schools on Guam in the postwar decades, reducing Catholicism’s predominance somewhat. Large-scale shortwave radio transmitters erected in the south of Guam broadcast multilingual Prot- estant missionary messages to the Asian mainland. In 1970, KGTE, a member of the Public Broadcast System, joined KUAM as Guam’s second local tele- vision station. With several radio and television sta- tions broadcasting daily, the American cultural em- brace of Guam tightened.</p>
                <p>It was in the early 1970s that a surrealistic last event of World War II took place on Guam when Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi, the final Japanese strag- gler, was found in January 1972 in the jungle inland from Talofofo. He had lived in a concealed, deep and roomy hole he had dug and had survived large- ly on boiled federico nuts and on fish and shrimp that he trapped in streams. He made his own clothes and traps from palm fibers. Yokoi returned to Japan a celebrity. He wrote a book, married, and revisited Guam several times as a man respected for his in- credible fortitude.</p>
                <p>While this final footnote to World War II was tak- ing place on Guam, in Washington, D.C., Won Pat (called “Pat” there but “Tony” on Guam) had be- come a close associate of Congressman Phillip Bur- ton, an energetic California Democrat on the pow- erful House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>who became chair of the Interior Subcommittee on Trusts and Territories. Republicans called him the “Godfather of the Pacific.” He pushed through P.L. 92-271 in April 1972—over Interior Department objections—which established official delegates for Guam and the Virgin Islands in the Congress with two-year terms. Won Pat won the November 1972 elections for the official position and took his seat in the House of Representatives in January 1973.</p>
                <p>Although sweet for the islanders, this victory for the two territories in gaining official representation did not significantly alter the neo-colonial political status of the islands since neither of the new insular delegates had voting rights on the floor. They could, however, vote in committees, a power the delegates used to the hilt to help their constituents in the years ahead as they built up seniority in the Congress. Won Pat was reelected every two years, often with- out challengers, until 1984.</p>
                <p>On Guam in the meantime, the Camacho-Moylan administration was focusing on the new scope of lo- cal political and economic authority opened up by Guamanian control of the island’s executive branch after 1970. The island was still dependent on the navy for electric power. The problem was that pow- er generation was barely adequate to meet both the military demand and the needs of the ever-growing private sector. To assure its own supply of electric- ity, the navy held on to the old power plant at Piti and to its new plant at Tanguisson (constructed by the navy in the 1960s) as well as its emergency gen- erators. To manage civilian power needs, Camacho and the Ninth Guam Legislature created the GPA (Guam Power Authority) in 1968.</p>
                <p>Electricity nonetheless remained inadequate, and a power crisis occurred in 1970-1971. Frustrated, Governor Camacho pushed the navy to agree in 1972 to hand over all power generation to GPA in June 1975. On the basis of the agreement, GPA is- sued new multimillion dollar bond issues in 1972 and again in 1974 to finance four big base-load, steam-powered General Electric generators at Ca- bras Island. Two of the new generators would come on line in August 1974 and June 1975, respective- ly, but the other two were never built because the</p>
                <p>227</p>
                <p>1973 Arab oil embargo caused a recession on Guam and reduced revenues to the point where two more generators could not be funded. By the mid-1970s, GPA found itself deeply in debt, still dependent on the navy’s generators and lines, and unable to pro- vide sufficient electricity to the private sector with reserve Capacity to meet emergencies. This tenuous power situation would worsen in the future.</p>
                <p>Despite problems with utilities, local control of executive departments opened up more jobs for lo- cals, both on merit and as political patronage. Be- tween 1970 and 1974, GovGuam employment in- creased to 8,570 jobs, a 56 percent increase, and, by November 1974, government employment jumped to over 9,000 jobs, including many temporary and limited-term hires, most of whom were taken aboard just before the 1974 elections and many of whom became permanent. The Guam Commercial Port and the Department of Public Works (DPW) became havens for “featherbedding” employment of supporters of politicians.</p>
                <p>While GovGuam executive agencies and depart- ments expanded, the Camacho-Moylan adminis- tration completed the low-rent, low-cost housing projects initiated under Governor Leon Guerrero through the federally supported Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority (GHURA). Cama- cho then initiated a new 501-unit low-cost GHU- RA development of single-family homes in Dededo in the early 1970s. With more jobs open to them, many island residents could afford by then to pur- chase homes through mortgages for the first time. As a consequence, private housing projects blos- somed with medium-priced ($25,000 and up, such as Ypaopao Estates) to high-priced (over $50,000, such as Barrigada Heights) homes that quickly sold out.</p>
                <p>Overall, Guam was becoming suburban in the American style of single-family homes in contrast to the old Chamorro style of married children liv- ing for years with parents in multifamily dwellings in village centers. New homes usually had to be all concrete and typhoon-proof to be insured and financed by mortgages. To take advantage of the economic growth, Jesus Sablan Leon Guerrero and</p>
                <p>228</p>
                <p>José Leon Guerrero Untalan, both formerly with the Bank of America branch in Agana, founded the Bank of Guam in 1972. Unconnected to the old na- val Bank of Guam and capitalized initially with the Calvo family holding the largest block of stocks, this new local bank grew phenomenally.</p>
                <p>Tourist infrastructure, with GEDA help through QCs, was also expanding. Governor Camacho re- structured the tourist commission and made it into the Guam Visitors Bureau (GVB) in 1970. New high-rise hotels popped up on Tumon Beach in the 1970s. The source of investment capital shifted from American investors to Japanese corporations that bound together airlines, travel agents, and ho- tels on Guam to roots in Japan.</p>
                <p>In 1973, over a quarter of a million tourists, of whom 70 percent were Japanese, visited Guam. Japanese travel wholesalers packaged group tours to Guam, usually for five days, that catered to Asian visitors at lower cost than to Hawai‘i. The Guam legislature tapped into the stream of tourist yen when it levied a hotel occupancy tax in the early 1970s, pumping millions of dollars into Guam’s treasury in the following years despite the fact that much of the profit from packaged tours stayed in Japan.</p>
                <p>U.S. military expenditures, personnel, and Sec- tion 30 payments on Guam continued to rise in 1970-1973 because of the Vietnam War, which provided additional GovGuam and commercial revenues. Guam’s role as a support and operational base for the Vietnam War also brought about the first open clash between military priorities and civil needs since the 1949 Guam Congress walkout. The navy’s ammunition wharf at Hotel Pier in Apra Harbor was near the Commercial Port. Military truck convoys loaded with bombs took priority on the crowded two-lane highway from the port to Marine Drive through Agana and then to An- dersen AFB in the north or to the naval magazine at Fena in the south. Regulations require ammo wharfs to be beyond a two-mile blast radius from civilian facilities in case of explosions. Ordnance could be unloaded at Hotel Pier only through waiv-</p>

                <p>ers. Faced with these constrictions, in 1967-1968 the navy decided on a new site for an ammo wharf on Guam.</p>
                <p>In November 1969, the navy announced—with- out consulting either the public or GovGuam offi- cials—that it planned to build a new ammo wharf at Sella Bay, an uninhabited, pristine enclave on the east coast of Guam between Agat and Umatac. Lo- cal reaction was initially ambivalent since the navy promised that “numerous job opportunities will be created” by the project. Soon, however, opposition surfaced among senators in the Eleventh Guam Leg- islature (1971-1972), which was controlled by a majority of fifteen Democrats.</p>
                <p>Opposition to the Sella project was led by Demo- cratic senators Paul J. Bordallo and Frank G. Lu- jan. Paul Bordallo—Harvard educated, successful in business, and a younger brother of Democratic leader Ricky Bordallo—was a defender of Chamor- ro rights, and he owned substantial land at Sella Bay. Lujan, a prominent lawyer and politician, was also an advocate of indigenous rights. While the two senators launched legislative resolutions against the Sella plan, a new local group, the Guam Environ- mental Council, petitioned the Department of Inte- rior to establish a seashore park in the Sella area to stop the new wharf.</p>
                <p>The COMNAVMAR at the time, Rear Admiral Paul E. Pugh, was negotiating with Governor Ca- macho to swap military land for the Sella property owned by GovGuam. Camacho wanted the entire Naval Air Station in exchange for Sella. The admiral refused that swap but agreed to allow unrestricted access to the civil air terminal (still screened by ma- rine guards at the time) and to give GovGuam the last one-third of Cabras Island plus some other land in return for public land at Sella. The two signed an agreement to that effect. The matter stalled when the environmentalists, along with Paul Bordallo, sued Governor Camacho in the District Court to halt the land swap. They lost, then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most lib- eral of federal appellate courts.</p>
                <p>There they won. In March 1973, the Ninth Cir- cuit unanimously reversed the District Court rul-</p>

                <p>229</p>
                <p>Sella Bay. In November 1969, the U.S. Navy announced unilaterally that it was acquiring nonmilitary land at Stella,</p>
                <p>a pristine bay between Agat and Umatac, to construct a large new ammunition wharf in support of the Vietnam War. This sparked a public controversy and gave rise to organized Chamorro activism in opposition to the navy plans. After court rulings and petitions against the project, the navy finally agreed in 1974 to build the new wharf at Orote Point on military land. Sella Bay remains pristine.

                <p>Guam)</p>
                <p>ing, stating that land exchanges of Guam’s public property must have the concurrence of the local legislature. In May 1973, a new COMNAVMAR, Rear Admiral G. Steve Morrison, finally briefed the legislature on the Sella Bay project to obtain concur- rence, but it was too late. Senator Paul Bordallo lob- bied vociferously against legislative approval of the swap, and another petition was circulated, eventu- ally signed by approximately 15,000 residents and</p>
                <p>sent to the Interior Department, to “Save Sella Bay.” The legislature did not approve the land swap. Naval officials in Washington decided to go ahead with the Sella project anyway. To get around the appellate court’s decision and the legislature, they planned to obtain the Sella land by invoking emi- nent domain. Rear Admiral Morrison immediately saw the folly in that path; he consulted with local civilian groups and persuaded them to agree to an</p>
                <p>230</p>
                <p>alternative wharf site on Orote Peninsula on navy property just inside the harbor entrance in place of Sella. With the Vietnam War winding down, the Pentagon agreed in 1974 to the Orote site.</p>
                <p>The new ammo wharf was not completed at Orote until the late 1980s, long after the Vietnam War had ended and the B-52s had been withdrawn from Guam. The original ammo wharf at Hotel Pier was turned over to GovGuam for use by tour ships. Sella Bay and a huge surrounding area of 12,500 acres from Agat to Merizo were designated in April 1978 as the Territorial Seashore Park, within which development was restricted. Sella Bay remains unin- habited and pristine today.</p>
                <p>Another outcome of the Sella Bay fight was the emergence of Chamorro-rights advocacy in the context of land taking by the military. The Twelfth Guam Legislature passed the Chamorro Land Trust Act in 1974. Sponsored by Senator Paul Bordallo, it authorized a Chamorro Land Trust Commission to lease “Chamorro homelands” (GovGuam land) to “native Chamorros.” The act was patterned after the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which the U.S. Congress recognized as granting limited land- holdings such as homesteads to indigenous peoples. The Guam law, however, was not implemented for the next eighteen years because of legal ques- tions and difficulties in defining who was a native Chamorro.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, a tidal wave of decolonization was oc- curring in the 1970s all around Guam in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands as the various dis- tricts initiated negotiations with Washington to change their political status. The TTPI broke into four entities: the Marshalls, Palau, the Northern Marianas, and a group of four—Kosrae, Pohnpei, Truk (later called Chuuk), and Yap—that would become the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). All except the Northern Marianas sought a new sta- tus of free association with the United States. In the Northern Marianas, a series of four polls from 1958 to 1969 showed that a strong majority of the inhab- itants favored unification with Guam to form a new U.S. Territory of the Marianas in which everyone</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>would be American citizens. Unification, however, was foreclosed for the time being by a special refer- endum on Guam in November 1969, when Guama- nians voted on the issue for the first time. In a low voter turnout of only 32 percent, a majority of 58 percent of Guamanians voted against reunification of the Marianas.</p>
                <p>Among the reasons for the rejection was that many Guamanians had not forgotten, or forgiven, the brutality of some Rotanese and Saipanese on Guam in World War II. Other reasons were that the Northern Marianas were less developed than Guam at the time (and thus might be an economic burden for Guam) and that the November 1969 election for the first local governor of Guam overshadowed and complicated the reunification issue.</p>
                <p>Leaders in the Northern Marianas, rebuffed by their fellow Chamorros on Guam, then appealed to Washington for “membership in the United States political family.” Guamanians did not realize that World War II had convinced American strategists to retain Rota, Tinian, and Saipan, or at the minimum to deny them (as in the case of free association for the rest of the TTPI) to any potentially hostile pow- er, in order to assure the security of Guam’s defense installations. Washington responded to the appeal of the Northern Marianas, and by December 1972 negotiations began.</p>
                <p>Guamanians were surprised when they learned that Washington was prepared to grant greater lo- cal autonomy to the Northern Marianas than Guam enjoyed. Guam’s leaders then established a status commission of their own in 1973. The commis- sion issued a report in September 1974 that listed nine complaints against the United States. The re- port also called for a constitution for Guam and the creation of a U.S.-Guam committee to review the military presence on the island, and suggested that a good “interim status position would be similar to the commonwealth status granted Puerto Rico in 1952 and that which is being negotiated with the Northern Marianas.” This conclusion was similar to one in favor of commonwealth made by Won Pat in his annual report in 1972.</p>
                <p>To focus attention on the status issue, in October</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>1974 the Guam legislature invited the UN special committee on decolonization to visit Guam and affirmed that Guam was “not self-governing,” as Washington had claimed since 1970. A two-page ad was placed in the Pacific Daily News in Octo- ber 1974 that reprinted the UN General Assembly’s Resolution 1514 on “the right to complete inde- pendence” for colonial areas as the ultimate po- litical status. The U.S. government did not permit the UN committee to visit Guam. Over the years to come, unofficial Chamorro and sometimes of- ficial GovGuam delegations would appear before UN committees to ask for help. Since Guam already belonged to the United States, unlike the North- ern Marianas (which the United States held only in trust), there was no imperative for Washington, D.C., to address Guam’s complaints or to involve the United Nations in the status issue, so no action was taken despite any merits to Guam’s appeals.</p>
                <p>Recession, Refugees, and Pamela</p>
                <p>The political controversies in the early 1970s com- bined to chip away at the popularity of the Cama- cho-Moylan administration. To compound Gover- nor Camacho’s problems further, Guam’s ten-year, post-Karen economic boom came to a halt in 1974, when the impact of the 1973 Arab oil embargo hit the island. Oil and gasoline prices soared world- wide, the economies of both the United States and Japan dipped, and the flow of tourists to Guam dwindled.</p>
                <p>With a recession under way, all elected incum- bents on Guam found themselves in trouble in the 1974 elections. Sensing the vulnerability of the Ca- macho-Moylan ticket, a faction in the Republican Party challenged the incumbents with a rival ticket of Senators Paul Calvo and Tony Palomo.</p>
                <p>For their part, the Democrats presented four tick- ets for the primary election: Ricky Bordallo and Rudolph G. (Rudy) Sablan, the latter a former ex- ecutive assistant to Governor Guerrero and execu- tive director of the Island Court; former governor Manuel Leon Guerrero, but this time with David D.L.Flores, his former director of agriculture, as a</p>
                <p>231</p>
                <p>running mate; Pedro C. Sanchez, former president of the University of Guam, with Esteban U. Torres, a retired naval officer; and Joaquin Arriola again, this time with Theodore S. (Ted) Nelson, a school principal turned politician.</p>
                <p>In the primary, Bordallo-Sablan swamped the other Democrats with a plurality of nearly 50 per- cent of the Democratic votes (the legislature had amended the election law to permit a plurality rather than a majority for the primary nomination). Democrats then rallied behind Bordallo-Sablan for the general election.</p>
                <p>It was a different story with the Republicans. The incumbent Camacho-Moylan ticket barely beat Cal- vo-Palomo in the primary. Because the count was so close, Calvo and Palomo decided on a write-in campaign in the general election. As a result, none of the three tickets won a majority in the November general election, but Calvo and Palomo were elimi- nated. With the Republicans divided by the write-in, Bordallo-Sablan squeaked by Camacho-Moylan in the runoff election. Carlos Camacho, worn out (he would die in 1979 of diabetes and liver failure), re- linquished Republican leadership to Paul Calvo and went back to his dentistry practice. Ricky Bordallo in turn consolidated his dominance of the Demo- cratic Party, a control that would last twelve years until the dramatic elections of 1986.</p>
                <p>With Guam in a recession, Governor Bordallo im- posed austerity measures in the government after his inauguration in January 1975, including a 25 percent cut in all departmental budgets and a freeze on GovGuam hiring. Nevertheless, the new admin- istration watched helplessly as outside factors bat- tered Guam’s little economy. Pan Am charter flights between Japan and Guam ceased in April 1975, and the flow of tourists slumped by 16 percent in 1976. The U.S. Navy, worried about GovGuam’s finan- cial health, reneged on the agreement to turn over its power generators and lines in 1975. The navy claimed that the GPA could not meet the perfor- mance standards needed to assure electricity for the island’s single power grid.</p>
                <p>New investments evaporated on Guam, and over</p>
                <p>232</p>
                <p>2,000 H-2 workers returned to the Philippines. The recession also swelled emigration of Guamanians (mostly Chamorros) to the mainland. Chamorros resident on Guam in 1975 were only 55.5 percent of the island’s population, while Filipinos had grown to over 19 percent. By 1980, there would be 17,662 Guamanians resident in California, mostly in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. By 1990, Guama- nians living permanently in California would num- ber over 25,000.</p>
                <p>Guam’s consumer price index (always high in comparison with the mainland U.S.) vaulted over 20 percent per year between 1973 and 1976. Unem- ployment jumped from 8.3 percent in May 1975 to 13.3 percent in May 1976. By this period, Guam’s poor were receiving federal welfare entitlements ini- tiated by Washington under the Johnson adminis- tration in the 1960s. From the end of 1974 to May 1976, the number of Guamanian recipients of food stamps skyrocketed from fewer than 300 to nearly 4,500 people. By 1980, food stamp recipients on Guam would total over 20 percent of the civilian population. Food stamps and other federal welfare support became a permanent feature on the island, even though the percentage of food stamp recipients later dropped in the boom of the late 1980s.</p>
                <p>Federal subsidies kept Guam afloat financially in the mid- and late 1970s. Direct federal rebates and grants-in-aid provided about twenty-five cents of every GovGuam budget dollar. Massive indirect federal funds subsidized Guam in everything from the crippled children’s service to spinoffs from construction contracts for military projects. By 1978-1979, these funds totaled, in the words of Pa- cific Daily News editor Joe Murphy, “an incredible $424.3 million, or $4,000 for every man, woman, and child on Guam.” The United States under Dem- ocratic president Jimmy Carter was making up for much of the neglect of Guam under naval rule.</p>
                <p>About the only island business that benefited from the 1973 Arab embargo was GORCO, the Guam Oil and Refining Company. Founded in 1969 with GEDA approval of a QC with a maximum 75 percent tax rebate on dividends for the company’s ten stockholders, GORCO built a lucrative refinery</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>in 1970 in the Atantano Valley to supply aviation jet fuel to the military as well as oil to GPA and the navy for power plant fuel. GORCO also prospered in the early 1970s because of the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>It would not be revealed until years later that the manager of GORCO, an amiable con artist named Fred Cochran, set up a lucrative scam that cost Guam’s citizens millions of dollars over the years in an “OOG” (Only on Guam) scheme. When the GORCO installations were constructed with pipe- lines from the refinery to the GPA storage tanks at the Piti power plants, Cochran had a secret pipe- line placed underground from the GPA tanks back to the GORCO tanks. Then, through well-bribed workers, he had oil pumped from the GPA tanks back to GORCO, thus gaining back oil for resale to GPA. This scam worked for years without detec- tion until it was revealed in the 1990s, long after GORCO had ceased operations, when Cochran was indicted on the mainland by the FBI in another scam involving Venezuelan oil. He revealed the GORCO scam as part of a plea bargain for a lower sentence.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, back in 1972 GORCO’s profits rose when operations by B-52s intensified with the “Christmas bombing” against the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. These strikes were intended to force the North Vietnamese back to the stalled Paris peace talks. At the peak of the operation, about 165 B-52s were based at Andersen AFB. The bombing worked, and in January 1973 a ceasefire was signed at Par- is. The United States then turned over the war to the South Vietnamese under the “Vietnamization” policy and rapidly withdrew its combat forces from Vietnam and the extra B-52s from Guam, leading, among other factors, to GORCO’s eventual closure and keeping fuel costs high on Guam.</p>
                <p>Deserted by the Americans, the South Vietnamese were unable to withstand the renewed North Viet- namese assaults. By April 1975, communist forces were at the gates of Saigon, and a massive, panic- stricken exodus of tens of thousands of noncommu- nist refugees began by aircraft and ships out of the country. Saigon fell on April 30, and the first part of America to bear the brunt of the defeat was Guam, “Where America’s Day Begins,” according to the</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>Pacific Daily News masthead and GVB tourist slo- gan for the island. Once more, Guam became an oasis of refuge as the first planeload of Vietnamese refugees landed unexpectedly at the civilian inter- national terminal in mid-April. After a week of bu- reaucratic confusion, Washington, D.C., authorized the evacuation of refugees from Vietnam through Guam. Refugees began to arrive in an unprecedent- ed human torrent called Operation New Life (U.S. administrations tend to use upbeat names for their programs and wars, even if they are failures). By April 25, over 14,000 more bewildered Vietnamese, Filipinos, and other nationals from South Vietnam arrived on Guam by aircraft.</p>
                <p>These initial arrivals were the well-off refugees, mostly pro-American government officials and military officers with their families. The flood of refugees quickly saturated the local lodging capac- ity, despite the prompt dispatch of hundreds of Vietnamese on to the States daily by aircraft after each person was processed for identity and given a quick medical examination. To house the transients, Seabees bull-dozed the tangantangan off the old runway at Orote airfield and erected a tent city for 40,000 people.</p>
                <p>The refugees still poured in, with over 13,000 ar- riving on one day, May 7. The navy opened a sec- ond major camp at the old Asan shore site where Filipino insurrectionists had been interned some seventy years earlier and buildings still stood from the former Naval Hospital annex used for Vietnam casualties. Governor Bordallo provided full assis- tance by GovGuam agencies for water, power, and other needs.</p>
                <p>On May 11, the carrier USS Midway sailed into Apra Harbor and off-loaded not only people but 101 former Vietnamese military and Air America (the CIA airline) aircraft. Civilian ships and boats of all sizes with yet more refugees began to arrive in mid-May, when the on-island population of evacu- ees peaked at 50,430, or about half the number of Guam’s residents. Most refugees in this seaborne steerage wave were poor, and many decided they wanted to return home. Security problems arose in June when the latter vociferously demanded to be</p>
                <p>233</p>
                <p>repatriated to Vietnam. Their return was held up as U.S. officials waited for the United Nations to make the arrangements. Dengue fever erupted among the refugees, and the military sprayed over a third of Guam with the pesticide Malathion to kill the mosquitoes that transmitted the disease. The fever subsided, but the spraying also caused fish kills and destruction of other wildlife on the island.</p>
                <p>In late August and early September, the repatriates rioted over the delay in their return to Vietnam; they burned buildings and vehicles at the Asan camp. COMNAVMAR ordered U.S. Marshals to quell the violence with heavy doses of tear gas. Strikes by the repatriates followed before a Vietnamese freighter (arranged at Ricky Bordallo’s suggestion) finally departed in October with 1,600 of them bound for South Vietnam, where many were promptly clapped into communist “reeducation camps” for years.</p>
                <p>On November 1, 1975, the last refugee camp on Guam—Asan—was closed. A total of 111,789 men, women, and children from South Vietnam had passed through Guam. Overall, Operation New Life was a remarkable success, given the short notice, the lack of preparation, and the massive number of refugees. The positive response of the government and people of Guam to the unprecedented evacu- ation of so many aliens through their island was a solid demonstration of Guamanian tolerance and of their loyalty to the United States.</p>
                <p>Earlier in 1975, the people of Guam learned a cov- enant had been signed on February 15 in Wash- ington to establish the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as an Ameri- can territory in “political union” with the United States. Washington made the agreement with the CNMI separately from Guam because the people of Guam had rejected unification with their northern compatriots. The new commonwealth status prom- ised the CNMI people U.S. citizenship and local self-government over land, immigration, labor, and taxes. The United States also pledged a generous fi- nancial assistance package to the CNMI for seven years with renewal to be negotiated. Between fis- cal years 1978 and 1992, the CNMI would receive</p>
                <p>234</p>
                <p>$420 million in direct federal subsidies, or nearly $2,000 per resident per year, in addition to indirect federal funding of food stamps, welfare benefits, and so forth.</p>
                <p>It had taken less than three years of negotiations once they began in December 1972 for the people of the CNMI to be accepted for American citizenship. The CNMI Constitution and the first local govern- ment would be installed in January 1978, with citi- zenship granted formally in September 1986, when the UN trusteeship ended for the CNMI. In contrast, it had taken the people of Guam nearly fifty years to accomplish the same goal. For Guamanians, as one observed, “it seemed ironic and unfair to many that they, who had obediently and patriotically served the United States for seventy-five years, should have less self-government than their neighbors.” By being united and flexible in negotiations with the United States, the Northern Marianas moved ahead of Guam in political development.</p>
                <p>Unknown to the leaders and people of Guam and even to the U.S. Congress at the time, the Nixon administration had initiated in the early 1970s a se- cret “Guam Study” to decide on Guam’s political status. The Department of Interior was designated to lead an interagency group headed by an ambi- tious Texan political appointee, Fred M. Zeder. The departments of State and Defense concluded Guam should be given the same status as the CNMI in or- der for the two entities eventually to unify as one U.S. commonwealth. This would assure American strategic control of all the Marianas.</p>
                <p>After Nixon resigned in 1974 as a result of the Watergate scandal, President Gerald Ford approved the recommended commonwealth policy for Guam in 1975 and ordered that negotiations be undertak- en. Zeder and Interior officials, in contrast, opposed the policy and in an incredible demonstration of bureaucratic arrogance managed to block negotia- tions. No one on Guam and no members of the U.S. Congress, including Phillip Burton, who headed the Interior subcommittee on territories, were informed of the secret Guam study or Ford’s directive. When President Ford was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 elections, Interior kept the Guam study and</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>the presidential directive secret, and the whole proj- ect was forgotten.</p>
                <p>The obstructionism by Interior would lead to years of frustrating negotiations at great public ex- pense by officials of Guam and the federal govern- ment in a quest for commonwealth that ultimate- ly failed. The full story of the secret Guam study would not be revealed until 2004, when the study was declassified over Interior’s objections, as will be discussed in the next chapter. The whole affair was an inexcusable case of executive malfeasance by the U.S. Department of the Interior against one of its territorial wards.</p>
                <p>The quest by Guam for commonwealth status re- ally began in reaction to the CNMI covenant, not to Ford’s directive as it should have. The Repub- lican majority in the Thirteenth Guam Legislature created a second Guam political status commission in early 1975 to prepare for a plebiscite on po- litical status by the people of Guam in 1976. The legislature designated the commission to represent Guam in status negotiations with Washington. The commission members, unaware of the secret Guam study, requested President Ford to send a represen- tative to confer with them about status possibilities.</p>
                <p>These steps antagonized Democrat Won Pat in Washington, who was not officially consulted or in- cluded in the commission and who knew nothing of the Guam study. His response was to undercut the Republican legislative initiative by introducing two resolutions in the U.S. Congress; one called for Congress to consider a constitution for Guam and another to establish a joint U.S.-Guam status com- mission separate from the one on Guam. Faced with Guam’s divided and contradictory efforts, the White House delayed naming a presidential representative and said nothing about the already approved Guam policy to allow commonwealth status for Guam. As a result, the Congress took no action on Won Pat’s resolutions. Meanwhile, the Interior head of the federal negotiating team, Fred Zeder, drafted a com- monwealth act on his own that would go nowhere.</p>
                <p>All political activity, however, as well as all routine matters, came to a halt in mid-May 1976 when</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropi- cal cyclone formation alert. One of the most enor- mous typhoons of the century was spiraling out of its spawning ground in southeast Micronesia and heading directly for Guam. The air force evacuated its Guam-based B-52s to Kadena Airbase on Okina- wa. On May 20, Governor Bordallo declared Guam to be in Typhoon Condition I (typhoon imminent), with winds already ripping away tin roofs.</p>
                <p>The storm was Pamela, the century’s third super- typhoon to strike Guam dead on. A supertyphoon was then considered to be a cyclone with sustained winds higher than 148 miles per hour (a new clas- sification for supertyphoons, Category V with 155 miles per hour winds or higher, was instituted by meteorologists in the 1980s). The century’s first su- pertyphoon, unnamed, to hit Guam was the one on November 11, 1900; the second was Karen on No- vember 11-12, 1962. Pamela, with sustained winds from 140 to 150 miles per hour for hourlong peri- ods and bursts to 190 miles per hour, moved leisure- ly across Guam at eight miles per hour on May 21.</p>
                <p>Since Pamela moved more slowly than Karen (lingering forty-eight hours over the island, with six hours of winds higher than 120 miles per hour), it caused more damage than Karen’s higher winds. Still, only one death was attributed directly to Pa- mela, compared to nine for Karen and thirty-four in the 1900 supertyphoon. Fewer lives were lost to Pamela because of improved forecasting methods and accurate warnings by the Joint Typhoon Warn- ing Center and because more buildings on Guam were all-concrete by 1976. Nevertheless, most pow- er poles were down, crops were gone, farm animals were killed or scattered, hundreds of coconut trees lost their crowns, and nearly all other trees, bushes, and shrubs were left naked of leaves.</p>
                <p>Governor Bordallo declared martial law, and a curfew was enforced for several days. Schools did not reopen until the fall, giving students a nearly four-month vacation. Damage to military bases was estimated at $200 million, and damage to private and public civilian property was roughly estimated at $300 million, or about a half billion dollars total for the island. As with Karen, Washington, D.C.,</p>
                <p>235</p>
                <p>immediately came to Guam’s assistance after Pa- mela. The island was declared a major disaster area, and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (FDAA, predecessor to the Federal Emergency Man- agement Agency, or FEMA) swiftly sent out people and money. Although the United States has often been politically insensitive in its treatment of Guam over the years, the American people, charity groups, military services, and the federal government have generously provided money and other aid to the is- land in times of typhoons.</p>
                <p>Like Governor Leon Guerrero after Karen in 1963, Ricky Bordallo in 1976 after Pamela saw fed- eral aid not only as an opportunity to reconstruct storm-damaged facilities, but also as a means to improve Guam’s infrastructure and economy. Bor- dallo, however, went beyond the proposals of Leon Guerrero. In January 1977, Bordallo requested that Washington fund an enormous new development program of nearly $289 million for Guam. Among the projects he proposed was a grandiose capitol complex on East Agana Bay with modern, glass- sheathed buildings of over 200,000 square feet to house all three branches of GovGuam.</p>
                <p>This glittering fantasy was not supported by the Republican majority in the Thirteenth Guam Leg- islature, which endorsed a more realistic program for improvement of roads, housing, and so forth. In Washington, Congressman Won Pat sided with the Guam legislature. Consequently, the U.S. Con- gress did not approve Bordallo’s proposal. Unfazed, the governor revised his proposal and requested it again, this time as a “Marshall Plan for Guam” that included new projects. Not only did Bordallo intend to repair Pamela’s damage and improve the island’s infrastructure, he also wanted to fulfill all the proj- ects promised but not completed by the naval gov- ernment after World War II, notably the rebuilding of Agana. The governor lobbied vigorously for his plan, but the reaction was again unreceptive.</p>
                <p>Bordallo’s political opponents, both Democratic and Republican, derided him as a quixotic dreamer, but his extravagant requests were surprisingly suc- cessful. In addition to the $115 million for typhoon- related rehabilitation, Washington gave Guam $120</p>
                <p>236</p>
                <p>million in federal grants and loans for non-typhoon- related capital improvement projects and another $132 million for GovGuam operations and services. Overall, Bordallo obtained approximately $367 million in 1975-1978, the highest federal funding for civil development in Guam’s history for a four- year period.</p>
                <p>One major but ambiguous project of Bordallo’s was the acquisition of a new building for the Guam Memorial Hospital. The old GMH at Oka had gradually deteriorated since its post-Karen renova- tion. One frustrated GMH administrator admitted to the press that “a patient’s life is in danger” at the hospital. A standing local joke on Guam in case of illness was “GMH means Get Me to Hawaii.” In 1974, the facility lost its accreditation once more. By the mid-1970s, GovGuam was considering sites for a new facility.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Catholic leaders planned to cre- ate their own hospital to replace the small Catho- lic medical center in Agana opened in 1955. The Diocese of Agana under the energetic leadership of Bishop Felixberto Flores obtained large loans and launched donation drives for construction in 1973-1975 of the 221-bed Medical Center of the Marianas (MCM). It was built at Oka on the site of the Mercy Convent only a mile from the old GMH. Bishop Flores hoped that the two hospitals would complement each other. As it turned out, the two competed for patients.</p>
                <p>Opened in January 1976, the MCM facility quickly became too heavy a financial burden for the Cathoic diocese to sustain since most of the public still went to GMH, where treatment was not only cheaper but often free. By Guam law (and a sure- fire vote-getter for politicians), GMH had to pro- vide care to the indigent and to Medicare and Med- icaid patients, but, also by law, it could not compel payment for that care. With MCM going bankrupt, Flores offered to sell the new hospital to GovGuam. Governor Bordallo readily agreed to the bishop’s offer.</p>
                <p>For financing, Bordallo turned to Washington. In a concerted effort, Won Pat and Phillip Burton then obtained a federal grant-in-aid from the U.S. Con-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>gress of $25.5 million for GovGuam to purchase MCM and another $10 million for public health and other projects. This money, however, was held up by Interior Department officials, who thought that the MCM price was too high. To save the di- ocese from bankruptcy, Bordallo went ahead and had GMH move into the MCM building in January 1978.</p>
                <p>The Diocese of Agana ended up taking a loss when GMH replaced MCM, but the new facility was no bargain for Guam’s taxpayers. The new GMH promptly slid toward bankruptcy when it could not make the $100,000-a-month lease pay- ments. GMH managed to survive on local appro- priations until federal money bailed it out in May 1979. Ever since then, however, the hospital has experienced grave problems in administration (po- liticized by appointees of the governors), in finances (owing to its inability to collect bills), and in pro- viding quality medical services (low staff salaries caused personnel problems, and budget shortfalls caused equipment shortages). Although the need for a public hospital was unquestioned, inept man- agement of GMH made possible one of the slickest scams in the history of the island, another “OOG.”</p>
                <p>The GMHP Scam and a Failed Constitution</p>
                <p>The scam came about through health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which in this period were beginning to provide medical services to groups of people on Guam under prepayment plans. By the mid-1970s the private Family Health Plan (FHP) was the only HMO on Guam for GovGuam em- ployees. FHP was profitable and effective, but it was owned and run mostly by statesiders.</p>
                <p>A number of local doctors led by Dr. Ernesto M. Espaldon—a Republican senator and leader of the Filipino community—and Dr. Eduardo Ortiz— chair of the GMH Board of Trustees—proposed to set up a GovGuam-owned HMO through GMH in order to provide GovGuam employees less expen- sive quality medical care. After considerable debate, in May 1977 the Republican-controlled Fourteenth Guam Legislature (1977-1978) unanimously passed</p>

                <p>the Guam Health Act, which created the Guam Me- morial Health Plan (GMHP). The same law made GMH “autonomous” so that its board of trustees (all, however, still appointed by the governor) could oversee GMHP.</p>
                <p>To organize and manage GMHEP, the hospital trustees gave a three-year contract for the period May 1977-May 1980 to the California-based Medical Services Association (MSA), affiliated with Hyatt Medical Management Services. In 1980, MSA reorganized into Health Management International (HMI), which received another three-year contract from the GMH trustees. MSA/HMI were owned in part and run by statesiders H. Ted Levenson as pres- ident and Jacquie C. Wilkinson as vice president.</p>
                <p>Over the years 1977-1981, the Levenson/Wilkin- son team would fail to pay Guam taxes, bilk GMH of tens of thousands of dollars (the exact amount has never been determined), and drive GMHP into bankruptcy. As a result of this scam, GMH once more tottered on the brink of bankruptcy in 1980. In September 1981, the GMH trustees belatedly ter- minated HMI’s contract, and Levenson and Wilkin- son departed Guam in a smokescreen of legal obfus- cations. The befuddled Guam legislature then took another nine months to separate the hospital from GMHP and initiate liquidation of the latter. Finally, in September 1982, the GMH trustees filed their first suit against HMI for recovery of money lost owing to “mismanagement.”</p>
                <p>That was the wrong charge. Wilkinson and Lev- enson were skilled managers—of a massive con game. First, they energetically signed up members in GMHP by an enticing advertising campaign, ex- panding membership from fifty-three in 1978 to over 5,400 by January 1980. They then skimmed off the monthly payments made by GMHP mem- bers for insurance premiums while ignoring GMH bills and notices to GMHP to pay for the medical services provided those members. To forestall ex- posure, Levenson and Wilkinson entertained GMH trustees, favored certain physicians with referrals, made hefty political contributions to Democratic and Republican candidates for public offices, and promised repeatedly that GMHP intended to pay</p>
                <p>237</p>
                <p>off its debts to GMH. Wilkinson claimed that the payment problem was due to a communication “mix-up.” Wilkinson and Levenson retained local lawyers with connections to GMH and politicians to fend off attempts to have their accounts audited.</p>
                <p>GMH never did recover its money. No MSA/HMI accounts were found to audit. When the GovGuam Department of Revenue and Taxation seized MSA/ HMI assets in 1982 for a tax liability of nearly $300,000, only $256 was found in the bank ac- count. By then, Levenson and Wilkerson had long since departed Guam. Action to bring them to trial was not pushed; it might have embarrassed or even compromised some prominent politicians, doctors, and lawyers on Guam.</p>
                <p>GMHP reorganized and resumed operations as a private provider of health care. As for GMH, it never did attain financial or operational health. In fiscal year 1990, unrecovered bills totaled $4.4 mil- lion, and the hospital’s operating deficit was $9.2 million. The facility (which had regained accredita- tion in 1980-1982) again lost its accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals in June 1983 for “an accumulation of problems” and has remained unaccredited ever since.</p>
                <p>One accomplishment of Bordallo’s first administra- tion was the establishment of the Guam Commu- nity College (GCC) in 1977. Back in 1972, the U.S. Congress had accorded land grant status to the Uni- versity of Guam. Won Pat, again relying on the help of Phillip Burton, obtained congressional approval of a $3 million endowment for the University of Guam (UOG) and annual grants of approximately $450,000. In June 1976, the Thirteenth Guam Leg- islature made UOG an “autonomous” nonprofit public corporation under an appointed board of regents through the Guam Higher Education Act. This act was prompted by an accreditation visit of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), which warned that UOG needed to be shielded from political interference, a warning that was ignored.</p>
                <p>With all this help, by the fall semester of 1977 UOG reached an enrollment of over 3,500 full-time-</p>
                <p>238</p>
                <p>equivalent students with a faculty of about 190, predominantly statesider academicians, in four col- leges: liberal arts, agriculture, education, and busi- ness. The university also assumed a regional out- reach educational mission, and Micronesians from throughout the TTPI began to attend. Enrollment was open; that is, all applicants had to be accepted, regardless of academic qualifications, which means that a large proportion of UOG courses were (and remain) actually high school-level classes called “developmental” mathematics and English for stu- dents who do not meet minimal U.S. undergraduate college standards.</p>
                <p>Governor Bordallo, with some justification, did not believe that UOG was providing adequate prac- tical, job-oriented education for Guam’s youths. In 1976, he proposed a technical college. After a fair amount of political skirmishing with the Republi- can-controlled legislature, GCC was established in 1977 near George Washington High School in Mangilao within a mile of UOG.</p>
                <p>As with the establishment of the two hospi- tals within sight of each other at Oka, creation of two college-level institutions close to each other in Mangilao resulted in competition and duplication of effort between them. Consequently, UOG’s en- rollment plummeted by nearly half over the years after 1977 as numerous freshmen and sophomores signed up at GCC, where tuition was lower and where some classes replicated classes at UOG. By the early 1980s, UOG had to reduce its graduate de- gree programs and began to suffer budget shortfalls that have lasted ever since along with accreditation problems.</p>
                <p>The Bordallo-Sablan administration of 1974-1978 was also plagued by problems not unique to Guam. Drug traffic ballooned on Guam in the late 1970s and early 1980s as marijuana from Palau and the CNMI and heroin from Asia flowed into and through the island. The media described this pe- riod as the “Heroin Days,” and the crime rate on the island “escalated spectacularly,” according to authorities. A Territorial Crime Commission Study, “Drug Abuse 1977,” showed the ineffectiveness</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>of police efforts to curb the drug trade. The report estimated $4.7 million worth of drugs were sold annually on Guam through the port and the post offices. Washington pumped money into Guam to combat narcotics, but the tempting flow of dollars led to corruption in the Guam police (then part of the Department of Public Safety along with fire- men). High-ranking police officers were convicted in 1977 for stealing money from an antidrug opera- tion called Cihik (Tiny Bird in Chamorro).</p>
                <p>Other GovGuam officials were indicted and found guilty (often by federal prosecution) of em- bezzlement and other crimes in the same period. In February 1977, the acting corrections chief and eight penitentiary guards (all poorly paid) were indicted for various crimes and eventually jailed. But imprisonment did not solve much. The creaky, overcrowded Guam penitentiary was a joke. Prison- ers casually escaped, some repeatedly, and usually spent a few days with family or friends before being picked up or turning themselves in. The attorneys general of Guam, political appointees at the time, acquired a reputation for following orders from the governor’s office and avoiding politically sensitive cases. This politicization of local justice and the growth of island crime led federal authorities to ex- pand the staffs of the U.S. district attorney, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and the FBI on Guam, but corruption and mismanagement went on, reach- ing a crescendo in 1980-1981, to the detriment of the Calvo administration in the 1983 elections.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Guam Power Authority (GPA) was slip-sliding toward bankruptcy because of increased oil prices and mounting debts. In 1976, GPA defaulted on its bond anticipation notes, but the Department of the Interior came to GPA’s rescue by guaranteeing a loan in early 1977 by the Federal Finance Bank (FFB) for $36 million for post-Pamela repairs and to pay off GPA’s defaulted notes and loans. Even with this federal assistance, GPA, short of sufficient cash flow, soon asked that repayment of the FFB loan be canceled. The federal authori- ties refused the request, and the loan would not be repaid until the early 1990s. A congressional Gov- ernment Accounting Office audit in 1977 concluded</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>that “GovGuam’s financial situation is a mess” but said that the Interior Department shared the blame, owing to “sloppy accounting practices.”</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that the Bordallo-Sablan ad- ministration was having financial difficulties was the federal requirement that Guam provide match- ing funds to obtain federal grants-in-aid for Med- icaid, food stamps, education, and the other social programs on which the island had come to depend. GovGuam tended to divert funds from capital im- provements in order to match federal grants-in-aid. To assist the territories, Phillip Burton initiated the Omnibus Territories Act of 1977, which allowed federal authorities to waive requirements for the insular territories to match funds for some of the programs.</p>
                <p>These waivers allowed Guam to save a great deal of money in the coming years, but capital infra- structure on the island still did not improve tangi- bly despite the creation of the Bureau of Planning in 1977. That year, a consulting firm completed a new islandwide land-use plan on the basis of the 1966 master plan, which was outdated by 1974 because of unexpected population growth. The legislature failed to implement fully the 1977 plan, just as it had with the 1966 plan. Planning and the use of expensive consultants to give an aura of “moving forward” and of “making progress,” but not imple- menting much, became a standard tactic of politi- cians on Guam as in the rest of the United States in the years ahead.</p>
                <p>One provision in the 1977 Omnibus Territories Act helpful for Chamorros amended the Organic Act to permit the U.S. District Court on Guam to review claims for compensation for private prop- erty condemned by the navy after World War II. A month later, José Herrero Torres filed the first of what would become hundreds of such claims. The bitter legacy of military land condemnations was complicated by Guam’s tangled land records. By the late 1970s, less than 22 percent of GovGuam land still had been properly surveyed and registered, leaving much land open to encroachments by neigh- boring private landowners.</p>
                <p>To remove this threat, in 1974 the Twelfth Guam</p>
                <p>239</p>
                <p>Legislature included a provision in the Chamorro Land Trust Act that restricted transfers of public land to those between owners of contiguous frac- tional lots and to exchanges for land of equal val- ue. Unfortunately, the law was not enforced. Over the subsequent decades a number of big-time land swindles resulted that involved huge encroachments on unsurveyed public land by crooked surveyors, real estate brokers, attorneys, and GovGuam land officials.</p>
                <p>Even when federal officials sought to improve land use on Guam, there were sometimes hidden penalties for the people of the island. In August 1978, the U.S. National Park Service established the War in the Pacific National Historical Park on Guam. The park was made up of seven areas where World War II battles took place, notably the Asan and Agat invasion beaches. Although a welcome ad- dition to the island, the park blocked a long-planned Agat boat harbor that was on the verge of construc- tion at Gaan Point. Despite protests by the people of Agat, the Department of the Interior compelled the U.S. Corps of Engineers and GovGuam to move the planned harbor several miles away to a less favor- able location. Interior forced the move by declaring a rusty World War II sewer pipe at Gaan Point to be a “historic landmark,” apparently the only sewer so distinguished in the history of the United States.</p>
                <p>Creation of the war park also constrained de- velopment along the lovely Agat shoreline, but for years Congress did not appropriate enough money for the National Park Service to purchase the pri- vate property within the park boundary along the shore. Landowners were stuck in limbo throughout the 1980s into the 2000s, unable to develop their property while not fully compensated for the unfin- ished park.</p>
                <p>Congressman Burton, prompted by Won Pat, fol- lowed up the first Omnibus Act in 1977 with an- nual omnibus territories acts. Full of “Christmas tree” appropriations for the island, these annual pork-barrel bills would bail out GovGuam repeat- edly over the coming years but did not reduce the deficit. The bills originated in a subcommittee for the territories that Burton created under the House</p>
                <p>240</p>
                <p>Antonio Borja Won Pat. Photograph taken in the early 1970s. He was Guam’s most prominent political leader for nearly forty years after World War II. He served as speaker of the House of Assembly of the Guam Congress from 1948 to 1951 and as speaker six times of the Guam Legislature from 1951 through 1965. He was a founder of the Guam Democratic Party in 1960 and was unof- ficial Guam delegate to the U.S. Congress, 1965-1973. He served as official Guam delegate to the U.S. Congress from 1974 through 1984. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In early 1979, Won Pat was made chair of this subcommit- tee, which became the focus of federal-territorial re- lations in the Congress. As the subcommittee chair as well as being a member of the House Armed Ser- vices Committee, Won Pat was able to make sure that Guam received a good share of federal funds each year until 1984, when he was replaced by a Re- publican delegate who could not maintain the help- ful pork-barrel subsidies in Democratic congresses.</p>
                <p>In the meantime the Guam political status com- mission held a referendum on status options in September 1976. A majority of 58 percent of Gua- manians voted for “improved status quo” out of five options on the ballot. Statehood garnered 24 percent, status quo received 9 percent, indepen- dence only 6 percent, and “other” 3 percent. Oddly, commonwealth was not an option on the ballot, an omission that further delayed resolution of the issue.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>While concern with political status gathered mo- mentum on Guam, in Washington Delegate Won Pat lobbied for authority for Guamanians to write a constitution for the island. In October 1976, Con- gress gave the legislatures of Guam and the Virgin Islands authority to create constitutional conven- tions. In December 1976, the Thirteenth Guam Legislature responded by creating a constitutional convention by a nonpartisan election of delegates. The thirty-two delegates included Senator Carl T.C. Gutierrez, an energetic Democrat elected president of the convention. For legal advice, the convention retained Washington attorney Arnold H. Leibowitz, an expert on federal-territorial law. From July to December 1977, the convention wrote an excellent constitution based on the latest models in the U.S. states.</p>
                <p>The document was sent for review in early 1978 to President Jimmy Carter and to the U.S. Congress. The plebiscite on the draft act was to coincide with</p>
                <p>OCEAN CHRYSALIS 1970-1980</p>
                <p>the 1978 elections on Guam, but the constitution be- came a partisan issue when Democrat Carl Gutier- rez declared his candidacy for governor. The Repub- lican-controlled Fourteenth Legislature promptly put off the constitutional plebiscite until April 1979 and then again to August. Local partisan politics, as often happens, took precedence over statesmanship in the decisions of Guam’s politicians.</p>
                <p>On the eve of the 1978 elections, Governor Bordal- lo found himself in trouble. He had bickered with the Republican-controlled legislature and was ac- cused of having the police spy on senators. He had reduced the roll of GovGuam employees from some 13,000 to 8,300, thereby angering a sizable block of voters. His troubles worsened when he quarreled with his popular lieutenant governor, Rudy Sablan. As a result, Sablan ran against Bordallo in the 1978 primary, with attorney José I. (Joe) Leon Guerrero as a running mate. Bordallo picked educator and historian Dr. Pedro C. Sanchez to run as lieutenant governor on his ticket.</p>
                <p>With the Democrats split, the Republicans united around the single slate of Senators Paul McDonald Calvo and Joe Ada. A complication arose for both tickets when Carl Gutierrez chose Dr. Joseph S. (Joe) Dizon, a Filipino Republican, former political science professor at UOG, and staff director of the constitutional convention, as his running mate on an independent ticket. In the September 1978 pri- mary, the Gutierrez-Dizon team received only 757 votes, far short of the 20 percent of the total needed to carry them into the general election. Bordallo- Sanchez beat Sablan—Leon Guerrero, but the divi- sions between the Democratic candidates weakened their support among the independent voters who decide Guam’s close elections. These independents went mostly for Calvo-Ada, who won the general election with 52 percent of the votes. Delegate Won Pat, unopposed, was reelected to Congress.</p>
                <p>Calvo, a capable business manager, lowered Gov- Guam’s deficit by $27 million in 1979, but thereaf- ter it began to climb once more to the highest point in history by 1982. One reason for the deficit was the inability (or reluctance) of GovGuam to col-</p>
                <p>241</p>
                <p>lect taxes, a problem about which federal auditors repeatedly complained. Poor administration and political influence in the Department of Revenue and Taxation made it possible for some taxpayers to avoid payment of taxes. Foreclosures on real es- tate for delinquent taxes were virtually impossible. Despite later improvement of tax administration by computerization, efficient tax collection is still a problem for GovGuam.</p>
                <p>Tourism on Guam under the Calvo-Ada adminis- tration received a boost when the new international airport terminal at Tiyan began operations in Au- gust 1979. Duty Free Shoppers, along with JAL, Pan Am, Continental, and Braniff, underwrote $43 million in revenue bonds to finance construction of the terminal. The Guam Airport Authority then accepted Duty Free Shoppers’ bid for an exclusive concession for the lucrative duty-free shops in the terminal. The Guam Airport Authority thereafter became one of the few GovGuam agencies to earn more than it spent.</p>
                <p>The first major political event in the Calvo-Ada administration was the vote on the draft Guam constitution in August 1979. President Carter and the U.S. Congress had earlier approved the draft without any changes, but on Guam opposition had grown among Chamorro-rights activists, who viewed the constitution as a Washington-mandated revised Organic Act that did not halt Filipino immi- gration or rectify inequities imposed on Chamorros by military and Interior Department authorities. By 1978, the most active Chamorro group in opposi- tion to the draft constitution was a coalition called Para Pada y Chamorros (para means “stop,” and pada‘ is “slap”; the name is a play on words mean- ing “stop slapping Chamorros”).</p>
                <p>According to the Pacific Daily News, the pub- lic remained “uninformed and confused about the 14-article constitution.” Opponents of the constitu- tion included many of Guam’s teachers, statesiders, and attorneys (the latter disliked the provision for a Guam Supreme Court). Faced with this opposition, Guam’s political leaders shied away from actively endorsing the draft constitution, thereby leaving it unprotected from its opponents. Won Pat favored it,</p>
                <p>242</p>
                <p>but he remained in Washington most of the time. As a consequence, in a low voter turnout of 47 percent, the people of Guam turned down the island’s first— and so far only—constitution by a huge majority of nearly 82 percent.</p>
                <p>A United Nations delegation observed the 1979 referendum and noted in its report that the negative vote seemed due mostly to local dissatisfaction with the status quo. Carl Gutierrez (who himself had politicized the plebiscite) attributed the rejection to the desire of Guamanians to settle the “status ques- tion” first, with the constitution to follow later. The constitutional exercise was “an expensive lesson in democracy—and futility,” wrote editor Joe Murphy in the Pacific Daily News. He had predicted that the draft would fail because of the lack of unity in sup- port of it by Guam’s leaders.</p>
                <p>The drafting of constitutions in the territories prompted a review by the Carter administration in late 1979 of federal territorial policy. The review, called the “White House Inter-Agency Task Force Report,” included hasty inputs from the territories. President Carter issued a policy statement based on the February 1980 review, which for the first time in U.S. history accepted “all options,” including pre- sumably independence, as open to the territories, so long as national security interests were protected. Carter’s initiative died, however, when Republican Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 to the White House and froze territorial policy.</p>
                <p>In light of the rejection of the draft Guam con- stitution, in early 1980 Senator Tony Palomo com- missioned the first local comprehensive study of the feasibility and benefits of various political status op- tions for the island. In an analysis of all options, the study pointed out that integration of Guam</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 14</p>
                <p>with Hawai‘i as a county was impractical. State- hood was judged to be politically infeasible as long as the Marianas remained divided. Free association or independence would result in the loss of Ameri- can citizenship for island residents, an undesirable prospect for most of the island’s people. A public opinion poll was part of the study; it confirmed that a majority of island residents were confused about the status issue. The study concluded that common- wealth status along the lines of the CNMI model would be best as an interim option for Guam. None of the authors of the study (who included the writer of this history) or anyone else on Guam at the time was aware that years earlier the Nixon-Ford admin- istration had reached the same conclusion in the se- cret Guam study that was never implemented owing to opposition by the Interior Department, as will be discussed in the following chapter.</p>
                <p>In May 1980, the legislature created Guam’s third political status commission, called this time the Commission on Self-Determination, along with five task forces, one for each major status option, including commonwealth. Each task force was to prepare a study of its option and explain it in an is- landwide education campaign to culminate in a Sep- tember 1981 referendum in which the people would select the status they desired for Guam.</p>
                <p>With these steps, the people and government of the island launched a formal quest for a new po- litical status. For over ten years, the pursuit of the phantom of political self-determination would be a major priority of the island’s governments. But other events would intervene to make economic is- sues, particularly Japanese economics, not political issues, the main determinants of the island’s devel- opment in the coming decades.</p>

                <p>Unfinished Quests</p>
                <p>1980-1990</p>
                <p>Land Claims, the Papal Visit, and a Strike</p>
                <p>For many Chamorros, the decade of the 1980s started off with the happy possibility of obtaining monetary redress in court for the massive acqui- sition of their properties by the U.S military after World War II. About 600 land claims reached the courts in 1980 after the 1977 Omnibus Territories Act reopened the issue of post-World War II land condemnations by the navy. Won Pat aroused ap- petites enormously on the island when he estimated that retroactive compensation for land claims could be $500 million, which with interest since World War II might ultimately reach $3.5 billion.</p>
                <p>Hopes dimmed when District Court Judge Cris- tobal C. Duenas dismissed the first major case in 1981. But on appeal the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court reversed and remanded Duenas’ judgment. The ap- pellate judges reasoned that the condemnations be- fore the old navy courts were not “contested cases” in that owners had not appeared to contest the con- demnations because to do so was largely useless. With this victory for Guamanians, more of them filed claims, reaching a total of 1,377 for 3,525 parcels of condemned land. In March 1983, all the cases were merged into a class action with seventy- three-year-old John Bohn—who had worked on the cases for years—as chief counsel.</p>
                <p>In 1983, the U.S. Justice Department offered to settle all the claims out of court for a total payment</p>
                <p>of $39.5 million. Since the earlier overblown esti- mates had raised exaggerated expectations, the of- fer outraged the claimants, now organized into the Guam Landowners Association (GLA). The issue of fairness was reviewed by District Court Judge Rob- ert Peckham, who decided in 1984 the offer was fair even though he disregarded the undue influence of the navy in setting the postwar land values. A ma- jority of the claimants then accepted the settlement, and money was prorated among the 5,200 former owners and heirs on the basis of ex post facto evalu- ations of their former properties as of the 1940s. Some 200 disgruntled claimants, mostly those with the largest claims, refused the settlement; they or their heirs continued legal action.</p>
                <p>The class action litigation over private land claims did not affect military retention of the par- cels for which compensation was sought. GovGuam itself sued the federal government in 1984 under the U.S. Quiet Title Act to recover excess land still held by the navy, but the case was dismissed in 1986 as beyond the statute of limitations by a mere twelve days. By then, the navy had begun to release more parcels of excess military land, initially over 900 acres in 1983 near the Commercial Port.</p>
                <p>In spite of such transfers, land held by the gov- ernment (military-federal and GovGuam) in 1984 was still over 50 percent of the island’s total area,</p>
                <p>243</p>
                <p>244</p>
                <p>only slightly lower than the 51 percent held in 1946. Return of more military land moved closer in 1986 after the Arny Report—named after then Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy L. Wayne Arny III— recommended that 3,546 acres of excess military property be returned to civilian hands. Later, with the downsizing of military bases in the 1990s, even larger amounts of military land would be turned over to GovGuam, including the entire Naval Air Station at Tiyan and parts of the facilities at Apra Harbor.</p>
                <p>While unresolved land issues smoldered on into the 1980s, the Calvo-Ada administration faced more immediate problems when in 1980-1981 a near- breakdown occurred in the Guam judicial and police system. The civilian police department had emerged back in the 1950s from the military police of the navy and marines, and the department tended to re- main a quasi-military structure rather than evolving into a professional civil police force. Police chiefs, often former military personnel, were appointed by the governor with legislative approval. This re- sulted, as in public education, in politicization of the police and chronic interference in police matters and charges of police corruption, as occurred with Operation Cihik in the 1970s. Similarly, the Guam attorney general and the director of the Department of Corrections were still appointed by the governor with the approval of the legislature and were repeat- edly subject to political interference.</p>
                <p>Under these conditions, GovGuam attorneys, of- ten young statesiders, generally lasted only one year or so even if their contracts were normally for three years. The attorney generals and the chiefs of police were often lapdogs of the governors, causing contin- ual personnel turnovers and management problems. Adding to police and judicial stress was the fact that the codified laws of Guam are still a detailed and for- mal mass. This legal maze makes justice on Guam rule-bound and overregulated yet politicized. The of- fice of the Compiler of Laws, expertly led for years by attorney Charles H. Troutman, continually worked to codify this ongoing legal inheritance of colonial- ism. These legal complications continue even though reform efforts have been repeatedly undertaken.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>One reason the legal and police problems were not addressed in the 1980-1981 breakdown was that all local problems were overshadowed when GovGuam employees sought a wage increase, lead- ing to Guam’s first full-scale strike in 1980. That year full-time GovGuam workers numbered 9,056. With 27 percent of all jobs, public and private, gov- ernment constituted the largest employer on Guam. In turn, the main union in GovGuam was the Guam Federation of Teachers (GFT), with nearly 2,400 members most of whom were certified teachers from the mainland United States. About half of all Department of Education (DOE) teachers were these statesiders, many of whom were hired on con- tract for a few years at the same salaries as local hires. Chamorros and Filipinos made up the other 50 percent of DOE teachers and most of the large DOE central administrative staff; they were nearly all local hires, and many did not belong to the GFT.</p>
                <p>Low salaries, inflation, and Guam’s high cost of living provoked the GFT to launch a petition to place a referendum question on the ballot for the November 1980 election: should GovGuam em- ployees receive a 30 percent cost-of-living salary ad- justment? The petition drive failed, but, since it was an election year, the legislature responded with a bill of modest GovGuam pay increases. Governor Cal- vo signed the bill in August 1980 as financially rea- sonable. The bill, however, did not satisfy the GFT.</p>
                <p>This situation became explosive when the sena- tors of the lame-duck Fifteenth Guam Legislature gave themselves, their staffs, and GovGuam direc- tors and judges—but not ordinary GovGuam work- ers—raises in December 1980 without a hearing or debate. Senatorial salaries jumped 27 percent to $26,000 a year, one of the highest incomes of all US. state legislators at the time even though Guam is smaller than any state.</p>
                <p>Outraged, the GFT held a rally in Agana on De- cember 19 and overwhelmingly voted for a strike action if not given a 30 percent raise. The same day, Governor Calvo—caught in the middle between the legislature and the GFIT—vetoed the senatorial raise. The senators then overrode the governor’s veto on December 31, the last day of the Fifteenth</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>Guam Legislature, by a fifteen to zero vote. The governor called the override an insult but warned he would dismiss any employees who went out on strike since strike actions by government employees are illegal under Guam law. The GFT then held a hasty vote by written ballot in January 1981 on the strike question; of the 75 percent of the member- ship who voted, 70 percent wanted to strike. Calvo swiftly sought an injunction to block the strike, and Superior Court Judge Janet Weeks granted it.</p>
                <p>The GFT leaders ignored the court order. On Jan- uary 12, they launched the island’s first mass strike (a small GFT strike action had occurred in 1975 over class sizes). The Pacific Daily News reported that 758 out of 1,464 classroom teachers did not re- port to work, mainly statesiders. Of these, 749 were suspended by DOE Director Dr. Katherine Bor- dallo Aguon (the first Chamorro woman to earn a Ph.D.), and picket lines appeared at public schools. The strike then became a confrontation between the GFT and GovGuam.</p>
                <p>By the end of January, strikers totaled about 900 people. Since this number was only about 10 percent of all GovGuam workers, the strike was doomed. Dr. Aguon appealed to the public not to allow the strike to harm the island’s children. This appeal was effective. As of February, Guam’s public school sys- tem was still functioning with double class sessions in high schools taught by nonstriking and substitute teachers. Absent students in the meantime began to drift back to school.</p>
                <p>In February, twenty days into the strike, DOE Di- rector Aguon fired 649 of the suspended teachers. She also announced the hiring of 224 “qualified” replacements, many of whom were not certified by U.S. teaching standards. They were heckled as scabs by strikers on the picket lines. Next, Judge Weeks levied a fine on the GFT of $2,000 for each work- day missed by not complying with her injunction. Discussions began between Governor Calvo and GFT President Conrad Stinson. Calvo reiterated, “There is no money for a pay raise.”</p>
                <p>Aside from the salary issue, the strike involved a clash of values between statesiders (the majority of strikers) on one side and Chamorros and Filipinos</p>
                <p>245</p>
                <p>(many of whom stayed on the job) on the other side. Many statesiders tended to be non-Catholic and lib- eral in outlook; they wanted quality education and fair wages. Nonetheless, the attitude of statesider teachers was perceived by many Guamanians as a lack of respect (tai respetu in Chamorro) for teach- ing and for the community leaders.</p>
                <p>When Governor Calvo joined by Bishop Flores appealed for the support of the government, they often spoke in Chamorro. They noted that the cul- tural traditions of the island rested on interdepen- dence and cooperation—inafa‘maolek in Chamor- ro—not on confrontations with authority. Leaders of a new Chamorro group, the Organization of Peo- ple for Indigenous Rights, or OPI-R (like other lo- cal titles, the name was a play on Chamorro words: oOppe means “to speak out,” in this case for rights), which emerged from the Para Pada group in 1981. OPI-R leaders agreed with the governor and de- clared themselves against the strike even though the governor and the legislature represented upper-class Chamorro socioeconomic control. Over the next few years, the OPI-R would become the focus of Chamorro-rights activism in the quest for common- wealth status for Guam and in taking that cause to the United Nations.</p>
                <p>A Chamorro core value is the avoidance of mamahlao, the shame or embarrassment of a fam- ily when one of its members acts in a self-serving or confrontational way. Linked to mamabhlao is the local tradition of respect for a patron—a per- son of authority, a protector, or a benefactor—who assists a family by providing jobs or other benefits to its members. For Chamorros, the highest au- thorities on Guam are the governor and the bishop. Furthermore, Chamorros were reluctant to strike against their kinsmen or their Rumpaile, kumaile, and mangga‘chong—godparents and close friends in pare networks—employed by GovGuam. Thus, many Guamanians perceived the 1981 strike as out- siders challenging local authority and traditions, while statesiders generally viewed it as a legitimate grievance against paternalistic, antiunion local politicians.</p>
                <p>Politically, the strike tended to pit Democrats</p>
                <p>246</p>
                <p>against the Republican administration and the Six- teenth Guam Legislature, where Republicans held a majority. Democratic leader Ricky Bordallo, who was already campaigning to take the governor- ship in the 1982 election, came to GFT rallies with Madeleine Bordallo to show support and counsel compromise.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the strike, His Holiness Pope John Paul II visited Guam in February 1981. The papal visit grew out of efforts begun back in the 1950s by Father Oscar Calvo and Father Juan M.H. Ledes- ma—a Filipino Jesuit scholar—to seek beatification of Father San Vitores. They undertook research in Spain and the Philippines in the 1960s and translat- ed into English a Spanish biography of San Vitores, The Apostle of the Marianas, by the Jesuit historian Alberto Risco. In 1968, the Guam Vicariate com- pleted an imposing new open-air shrine at the site of San Vitores’ martyrdom at the east end of Tumon at Naton Beach, then still largely empty of hotels. Father Calvo’s gradual loss of eyesight halted his active participation in research, but the beatifica- tion effort was carried on by Bishop Flores with Fa- ther Ledesma in the 1970s. In the late 1970s, when</p>

                <p>John Paul II made a pastoral visit to Guam February 22-23, 1981, and was greeted by large, reverent crowds. He celebrated an open-</p>
                <p>air Mass at the Plaza de Espafia</p>
                <p>in Agana before 15,000 to 20,000 people. He is shown here with Guam Bishop Felixberto Flores. (From the collection of the Micronesian Area Research Center, Mangilao, Guam)</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>Flores learned that Pope John Paul II planned to visit the Philippines and Japan, the Guamanian prel- ate invited him to Guam. The pope accepted, and on February 22, 1981, he stepped off a Philippines Airlines jet to kneel and kiss the ground of Guam. He concluded the arrival ceremony with the gentle Chamorro words “Hu guiya todo hamyu!” (I love all of you!).</p>
                <p>The next day he celebrated an open-air mass at the Plaza de Espafia with a crowd of 15,000 to 25,000 people. He also unveiled a sign that changed Agana’s Saylor Street to Chalan Santo Papa Juan Pablo Dos. Guamanians later erected a monument to John Paul II, a life-size bronze statue that rotates 360 degrees to the delight of Japanese tourists, on a traffic island in the middle of Chalan Santo Papa. The pope ignored the teachers’ strike during his one-day stay on the island.</p>
                <p>With the pope’s departure, all eyes turned once more to the strike. The Sixteenth Guam Legislature, still with a Republican majority and with sixteen in- cumbent carryovers, did nothing to resolve the mas- sive problem created by the Fifteenth Legislature. When negotiations resumed, the head of the Gov- Guam team, Matt Lonac, waited for the dwindling</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>bank accounts of the payless strikers to decide the issue. Lonac proved correct. Strikers began to drift back to work as the negotiations droned on.</p>
                <p>Finally, on March 11, the Pacific Daily News headlined, “GFT CALLS IT QUITS.” Governor Calvo appeared on television to offer 200 jobs in DOE with no reprisals to strikers who applied for those specific jobs. By then, 303 substitute teachers had been hired and were kept on the rolls. Many strikers accepted the governor’s offer, but over 200 others—some of them the most qualified teachers, including UOG professors—departed Guam with their families.</p>
                <p>By 1982, the school system was generally back to normal operations, but settlements of individual cases dragged on through the Guam Civil Service Commission and the courts for years. The courts decided the initial twenty-day suspensions of strik- ers by DOE Director Aguon were illegal. In Febru- ary 1984, the second Bordallo administration re- solved most of the legal matters for those who had returned to work.</p>
                <p>The strike of 1981 damaged Guam’s educational system and the GFT. The union never regained the influence it possessed before the strike. Uncertified teachers hired temporarily in the strike were grand- fathered into DOE with provisional certifications and became permanent hires. Striker versus non- striker antipathy persisted for years, and the quality of public education on Guam suffered. This deterio- ration was evident when Guam’s public high school students repeatedly scored lower than most students elsewhere in the nation on Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) for years following the strike.</p>
                <p>Every new DOE director in the 1980s and early 1990s (all were political appointees) announced plans to improve education on Guam, yet manage- ment of DOE was lethargic and much teaching re- mained mediocre. Uncertified teachers continued to be hired, and school facilities failed to keep pace with population growth. Military parents com- plained that their children came home speaking English with strange accents and broken syntax learned at school. In the late 1980s, the military services considered establishing a Department of</p>
                <p>247</p>
                <p>Defense (DOD) school system for their dependents on Guam because of the poor quality of Guam’s schools. The DOE would thereby lose the large an- nual DOD subsidy. A separate military system was averted, for the time being, by a DOE-navy agree- ment that required English-language testing of DOE teachers and remedial training of those who fail. In the meantime, private schools—St. John’s Episcopal School and other religious academies—where stan- dards remained high, saw their enrollments surge as many parents removed their children from public schools.</p>
                <p>The root cause of Guam’s many problems with public education was the Organic Act, which gave excessive appointive power over DOE and UOG officials to the governor and budgetary control to the legislature, resulting in politicization and bu- reaucratization of the system. The teachers’ strike of 1981 had a political impact but of a paradoxi- cally divided nature: many senators who provoked the strike by their pay raise were reelected in the years ahead by Guam’s forgiving electorate, who viewed them as defenders of local authority during the strike. In contrast, Governor Calvo, who was perhaps least responsible for the strike and who led the opposition to it, would not be treated so kindly by the voters in the 1982 elections.</p>
                <p>By 1982, Calvo’s economic policies had disap- pointed his supporters, particularly the business community, which was now becoming sizable. The GovGuam payroll (which in 1978 Calvo had prom- ised to trim) swelled by 22 percent. The deficit had ballooned to $83.3 million in 1982, $10.7 million above the deficit that Calvo had inherited in 1978. In 1982, once-prosperous GORCO was in trouble because of tax problems and the drop in the mili- tary’s need for fuel after the 1975 defeat of the Unit- ed States and South Vietnam in the Vietnam con- flict. In 1984, the GORCO refinery, Guam’s only significant industrial entity, closed.</p>
                <p>In addition to Calvo’s economic and strike head- aches, he—like Bordallo—compounded his prob- lems by quarreling with his lieutenant governor. The result was that he dropped Joe Ada from his ticket</p>
                <p>248</p>
                <p>in the 1982 gubernatorial race, replacing him with a personable young attorney, Peter F. (Pete) Perez, Jr., from one of Guam’s most prominent families, the Gollo-Perez clan. Calvo’s problems mounted when another Republican ticket challenged him in the pri- mary: the team of Senators Kurt Moylan and Frank FE. Blas.</p>
                <p>The Democrats also offered two tickets in the 1982 primary. To avoid another split with his num- ber two, Ricky Bordallo picked a political newcom- er as his running mate: fifty-two-year-old Colonel Edward Diego Reyes of the U.S. Air Force. A deco- rated Vietnam War veteran, Eddie Reyes retired from the air force and returned to Guam to run with Bordallo. The other Democratic ticket was head- ed by Rudy Sablan, who ran again with Joe Leon Guerrero.</p>
                <p>In the primaries Bordallo-Reyes swamped Sa- blan—Leon Guerrero, and Calvo-Perez easily beat Moylan-Blas by 12 percent. In the campaign for the general election, the main tactic of the Calvo-Perez team, using the incumbent governor’s authority, was to mount a massive program to asphalt miles of the island’s unpaved roads, including the private driveways of constituents. Bordallo-Reyes launched a lively multimedia campaign under the slogan “People First.”</p>
                <p>The race for Guam’s delegate in Washington took on special interest in 1982, when Won Pat was chal- lenged by a political outsider who, like Eddie Reyes, was a retired military officer. This was Vicente Gar- rido (Ben) Blaz, a former brigadier general in the U.S. Marine Corps. When he retired in 1981, Blaz was the highest-ranking Chamorro in the armed forces. Won Pat had weathered a strong challenge in the 1980 election by Republican Tony Palomo, but in Blaz in 1982 he faced an opponent who not only called for new blood in Washington but also dem- onstrated ties with the Reagan Republican White House.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Calvo ran into more problems when his hasty road-paving project turned sticky. The federal comptroller’s office, that annoying thorn in the side of GovGuam, revealed that money used for driveways was from the federal highway</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>fund; such use was improper. The charges hurt Calvo’s image, and he resorted to hiring temporary GovGuam workers—1,427 of them—to garner votes. These “ninety-day wonders” cost taxpayers about $4 million but did not quite tip the electoral balance. Bordallo-Reyes won by slightly less than 5 percent. Won Pat squeaked by Ben Blaz with only 718 votes, a thin victory that assured a Won Pat ver- sus Blaz rematch in the next election. The 1982 elec- tion also ended the eight-year Republican control of the legislature. A majority of fourteen Democrats swept into the Seventeenth Guam Legislature on the coattails of Bordallo-Reyes. In his inaugural speech, Bordallo called for an “economic rearmament” of Guam and attainment of commonwealth status.</p>
                <p>The Status Search and a New Boom</p>
                <p>Guam’s quest for a new political status stumbled off to a hesitant start in January 1982, when the first official referendum was held to determine which status the people of Guam desired. But the public was not really interested: only 37 percent of Guam voted on the seven options presented. Common- wealth—defined in the ballot along the lines of the 1975 CNMI covenant—was picked as the preferred option, but by a plurality, not a majority, of 49 per- cent over second-place statehood at 26 percent.</p>
                <p>Because no option received a majority, the legis- lature scheduled a second referendum, with com- monwealth and statehood as the only choices, to coincide with the regular primary in September 1982, when voter interest would be higher. Eighty- two percent of the registered voters turned out and chose commonwealth again over statehood by 73 to 27 percent. Guam finally had a definite status goal.</p>
                <p>With Bordallo’s election in 1982, the old Repub- lican-controlled Commission on Self-Determination dissolved, while the new Democratic administration and legislature considered how to attain common- wealth status. Bordallo decided on a strategy that unknowingly replicated the 1970s secret federal Guam study, about which he was still apparently in the dark.</p>
                <p>The sequence he envisioned was first to make</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>Guam a commonwealth as an interim status equal to that of the CNMI. Bordallo knew that common- wealth is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution as a status option for territories. It would only be a transition status that leads to either statehood or independence, as occurred in the case of the Philip- pines. Second, draft and implement a constitution for Guam compatible with commonwealth status. Third, reunify the Marianas under one constitu- tion; unification is the only way either Guam or the CNMI has a chance of becoming a state (the prec- edent is Hawai‘i, which would never have become a state if it had been divided as are the Marianas). Finally, seek statehood as a united Commonwealth of the Marianas which would make statehood more feasible with a larger population.</p>
                <p>Bordallo knew this long-range strategy on politi- cal status faced formidable obstacles. Therefore, he discussed his vision with only a few advisers, includ- ing the author of this history, while he undertook the process one step at a time. As a beginning, he convened a working group to draft an informal ver- sion of the commonwealth act. While that draft was being written, he tried to initiate negotiations with the executive branch as had taken place with the Northern Marianas.</p>
                <p>Interior’s reply to Bordallo was tepid, so Won Pat introduced a resolution in Congress that called on President Reagan to designate an executive official to negotiate a status change with Guam. This effort failed when neither Interior nor the White House endorsed the resolution. They were apparently un- informed of (or ignored) the secret Guam study whereby President Ford had already ordered just such negotiations back in 1974. By this time, Won Pat’s influence had been weakened by the death of Congressman Phillip Burton, who had been a staunch and powerful ally of Won Pat and the peo- ple of Guam.</p>
                <p>The picture brightened in 1983 when a Republi- can from New Mexico, Manuel Lujan, Jr., who was vice chair of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee (he would later become the Secretary of the Interior under President George H. W. Bush) suggested that Guam submit a commonwealth act</p>
                <p>249</p>
                <p>directly to Congress, thereby bypassing the Reagan- Bush administration, particularly the reactionary Interior Department. This culminated in a meeting in December at Albuquerque (Lujan’s home town), where a large bipartisan delegation of Guam’s lead- ers led by Bordallo committed themselves to sub- mitting a commonwealth act as a working draft, not as a final unchangeable document, to Congress. Lu- jan told the Guamanians to throw everything they wanted into the draft to expand local autonomy, including the “kitchen sink,” but they must be pre- pared to compromise and to negotiate substantive changes in the bill. The commonwealth act was to replace the 1950 Organic Act, but this time the peo- ple of Guam would vote on the version Congress passed. This understanding that it would take flex- ibility and compromise on both sides was dubbed “The Spirit of Albuquerque” by the media and Gov- ernor Bordallo.</p>
                <p>In January 1984, the Eighteenth Guam Legisla- ture established a new bipartisan Commission on Self-Determination. Governor Bordallo was chair. For legal counsel, the commission retained Wash- ington attorney Arnold H. Leibowitz, the respect- ed federal-territorial law expert who had assisted earlier Guam political status commissions and the constitutional convention. The author of this his- tory was appointed executive director of the com- mission. In early 1985, the commission produced a semifinal synthesis, called Working Draft 4, crafted by Leibowitz.</p>
                <p>The heart of this initial draft of the act was that Guam would remain under U.S. sovereignty but the Congress would allow the island’s citizens self- determination (they would vote on it, unlike the 1950 Organic Act) with control of their own gov- ernment under their own constitution within the U.S. Constitution. Mutual consent between Guam and the United States on changes to the substantive provisions of the act was not a nonnegotiable cen- terpiece of the initial draft. Instead, mutual consent was viewed as protection from federal authority in a manner similar to that enjoyed by citizens of the CNMI under their commonwealth covenant, that is, as something to be negotiated. Of more direct im-</p>
                <p>250</p>
                <p>pact, the Department of the Interior’s oversight of Guam would cease, as would other federal controls such as the Jones Act, which limited shipping be- tween Guam and other U.S. ports to American flag carriers only, a restriction that harmed Guam and that did not apply to the Virgin Islands or American Samoa.</p>
                <p>Guam’s version of commonwealth, it was hoped, would provide greater certainty in Guam’s relation- ship “in union” with the United States (as are the fifty states) without precluding an alternative future status such as statehood or independence. Com- monwealth status, however, cannot make Guam a member of the U.S. Electoral College (gained only by statehood or a constitutional amendment), so the draft act did not call for Guam’s citizens to be given the privilege of voting in U.S. presidential elections.</p>
                <p>The Guam commission explored congressional reactions to the draft act on visits to Washington in late 1984 and 1985. Reactions were favorable, but Morris K. Udall, the powerful chair of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee (which de- termines territorial matters) recommended that the people of Guam not vote on the draft prior to its submission. He noted that Congress would inevita- bly alter the draft, thereby disappointing the people of Guam had they already voted on the text.</p>
                <p>Udall’s suggestion was not followed because of concern on Guam with issues that from the Cha- morro point of view were not sufficiently addressed in the draft: Chamorro self-determination by a Cha- morro-only vote, mutual Guam-U.S. consent for all substantive changes in the act, and the protection of the indigenous people and their culture from being submerged by outsiders. This last concern is valid. For Chamorros, a vivid example of such ethnic, cul- tural and potential political displacement is the Ha- waiian Islands, where native Hawaiians became the poorest minority and least influential people in their own islands in less than a hundred years under U.S. rule. As far back as 1974, a Guam legislative sub- committee report concluded, “If political autonomy is not obtained by the people of Guam, the death of Guam’s culture [meaning Chamorro culture] is in- evitable.” Censuses show that islanders of Chamor-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>ro descent had already slipped from a majority to a plurality of Guam’s inhabitants by 1980. The con- tinuing decline of the Chamorro people on Guam as a proportion of their island’s population is shown in Table 2.</p>
                <p>Despite being only a plurality of residents on Guam after 1980, Guamanians of Chamorro de- scent still were and still are for the time being the majority of voters since many newcomers—Micro- nesians, military personnel, and temporary residents not U.S. citizens—are ineligible or not registered to vote. Nonetheless, unchecked immigration by aliens and emigration by statesiders and U.S. nationals will diminish Chamorro political control of the is- land. Thus, defenders of Chamorro rights fear (cor- rectly, by factual historical indicators; see Table 2) that American pluralism and multiculturalism per- petuate victimization of Chamorros on Guam.</p>
                <p>By the mid-1980s Chamorro indigenous rights activism had grown into a sizable nativist cultural and political movement. Chamorro language in- struction became obligatory in public schools. Chamorro delegations to the United Nations in- creased in frequency and stridency with appeals for self-determination, and villages and other places began to be renamed with Chamorro versions of names. The word “Guamanian” was generally re- placed with the word “Chamorro” when referring</p>

                <p>Indigenous activists in OPI-R advocated many changes in the initial draft act. Some suggestions were adopted, but the commission did not agree to OPI-R’s most radical demand, that only Chamorros be permitted to vote on the act. In a broad political definition, the draft commonwealth act stated the indigenous Chamorro people constitute “all those born on Guam before August 1, 1950, and their descendants,” thereby including other, and mixed, ethnicities.</p>
                <p>Apprehensive that the act might infringe on sov- ereign federal powers, Congressman Udall recom- mended substantive revisions in the draft, the most significant being a request to remove wording that required Guam’s mutual consent of major changes in military bases and a provision that gave Guam’s congressional delegate near veto power over the ap- plicability of federal law to Guam. Udall stated that, if these changes were made, the commonwealth act would be approved in the fall of 1985 by the House of Representatives. Udall’s proposals appeared rea- sonable to Bordallo—who well understood the po- litical reality that Guam must compromise to get the act through Congress—and the governor knew that Udall had the clout to assure the act’s passage. Ac- cordingly, Bordallo recommended that Udall’s sug- gestions be accepted.</p>
                <p>Immediately, the OPI-R and Republican leaders led by Senator Joe Ada objected to Bordallo’s pro- posal and threatened to withdraw Republican sup- port of the act if Bordallo gave in to Udall. Ada be- lieved Guam had to stand firm against any watering down of Chamorro aspirations; he would rely on an all-or-nothing-at-all strategy. Bordallo and other commission members, mindful of the need for uni- fied local support of the act—and not wanting Joe Ada to coopt Chamorro activists in the next guber- natorial election—then rejected Udall’s suggestions and added more autonomy for Guam in the final version of June 11, 1986. This would prove to be a strategic mistake on Guam’s part.</p>
                <p>251</p>
                <p>Overall, the revised draft asked for more than the CNMt had obtained, notably that Guam’s common- wealth act could be “modified only with the mutual consent” of the United States and the Government of Guam. This last open-ended demand (which would give Guam greater powers in some respects than even U.S. states possess) would subsequently be- come a nonnegotiable stand by Joe Ada and would help him become the next governor of Guam.</p>
                <p>After the rebuff of Udall, attitudes toward the act split along ethnic lines on Guam and into a Guam versus Washington dichotomy overall. A quick study in May 1986 by the Congressional Research Service raised red flags on the constitutionality of many of the act’s provisions. Congressional com- mittee and staff members shifted from being allies to being passive adversaries of the act as it became more pro-Chamorro in content.</p>
                <p>An event that slowed the quest for common- wealth was the defeat of Won Pat in the November 1984 election for Washington delegate by Repub- lican Ben Blaz. The election ended the outstanding political career of Antonio Borja Won Pat, a career that began prior to World War II and that included the speakership of the Guam legislature a record six times. His public service to the people of Guam was the most helpful of any island political leader in the postwar era in terms of obtaining financial assis- tance from Washington, D.C. He died in May 1987 of a heart attack in a hospital near his Washington home at the age of seventy-eight.</p>
                <p>Because Won Pat had chaired the House Subcom- mittee on Insular and International Affairs, he had been in a powerful position to push Guam’s quest for commonwealth, which he supported as an inter- im status necessary to attain statehood. Ben Blaz, in contrast, while serving with poise in Congress, was a minority Republican in Democratic congresses. Therefore, despite his energetic efforts, Blaz faced greater political obstacles than Won Pat in bringing about compromises and in obtaining majority party support in Washington for passage of legislation fa- vorable to Guam, including the commonwealth act.</p>
                <p>By the time the revisions of the draft common- wealth act were completed, it had become emotion-</p>
                <p>252</p>
                <p>ally as well as legally controversial, both on Guam and in Washington. This had not been the case with the CNMI covenant. The next step was to hold a plebiscite—contrary to Udall’s counsel—on the fi- nal draft. This also had not been the case with the CNMI. Guam’s political leaders believed that a vote prior to submission to the Congress would dem- onstrate Chamorro solidarity and thus reduce the chances of revisions in Washington. Guam’s sena- tors, however, undercut this goal by their opposi- tion to a possibly divisive status vote at their own regular election in 1986 at which they would have to take stands on commonwealth, so they delayed the plebiscite until August 1987. The loss of mo- mentum slowed Guam’s quest for commonwealth to a snail’s pace in the following years.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in local matters one of Bordallo’s poli- cy initiatives was a bold but bizarre plan to solve the island’s power shortage. In March 1983, he signed an agreement with energy entrepreneur Stanley Z. Siegel to explore the use of windmills to generate electricity. The $400 million project called for an initial emplacement of 500 tall propeller-type tur- bines to be driven by the northeast trade winds. If successful, they would be followed by 4,500 more of the spindly machines all across the mountains of Guam. The legislature’s reaction was predictable: “WINDMILLS BLOW SENATORS’ MINDS,” pro- claimed the Pacific Daily News. The project died for lack of legislative support.</p>
                <p>After the failure of Bordallo’s tilt at windmills, no one in GovGuam during the next decade seri- ously planned for additional big base-load power generators. The Guam Power Authority’s politically appointed board and management turned over with each new administration. Work crews, however, stayed in their jobs and performed valiantly in ty- phoons and other emergencies. Poor management of GPA and the lack of foresight by Guam’s elected leaders (along with damage by typhoons) to meet rising power needs caused the island to suffer re- curring electrical outages when demand outstripped the capacity of Guam’s power system.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>An educational problem the Bordallo-Reyes ad- ministration inherited was the shaky accreditation status of the University of Guam. As in primary and secondary public education, administration at UOG, accompanied by politicization, took priority over teaching. After an inspection by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in June 1981, UOG received a “warning” for ten deficien- cies. Little was done to correct the problems, and UOG lost its off-campus classes on Guam’s military bases to the University of Maryland overseas pro- gram because of navy and air force dissatisfaction with UOG standards.</p>
                <p>Following another WASC inspection, UOG was notified in January 1984 that it had slipped to a “show cause” status. The university had to show within a year why accreditation should not be with- drawn. The main deficiency was political interfer- ence. Withdrawal of accreditation means that other educational institutions may not accept UOG cred- its of students who transfer or who seek graduate degrees elsewhere. Loss of accreditation would also eliminate UOG’s popular ROTC program.</p>
                <p>The UOG faculty and the new administration of Dr. Jose Q. Cruz (who had been on Bordallo’s election campaign staff) worked hard to solve the school’s management and academic deficiencies while the legislature passed a law for six-year stag- gered terms for UOG regents to prevent the gover- nor from packing the board with his appointees. Subsequently, the university climbed back to ac- ceptable standards under presidents Dr. Wilfred P. Leon Guerrero, who was appointed in 1987, and Dr. John Salas from 1994 to 1996, but the political appointment of Dr. Jose Nededog in 1997 would, as discussed in the next chapter, bring the university to a new low with regard to accreditation.</p>
                <p>Religious leadership in the meantime changed on Guam after the papal visit in 1981. The visit had been a high point in Bishop Flores’ stewardship of the Catholic community. Subsequently, Pope John Paul II elevated the Diocese of Agana to an arch- diocese as part of a church reorganization through- out the world. In May 1984, Bishop Flores was installed as the first metropolitan archbishop of</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>Agana, and the Vatican also honored Guam by el- evating Agana’s Dulce Nombre de Maria church to a cathedral-basilica. In November 1984, the pope announced the beatification of San Vitores, and the Jesuit martyr was formally beatified as the Blessed Diego of the Marianas at an elaborate ceremony at- tended by many Chamorros in Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome in October 1985. Archbishop Flores, a much beloved man, died during a kidney transplant operation later that month at age sixty-four. Catho- lic leadership of Guam passed to Anthony Sablan Apuron, O.EM., D.D., a Capuchin, who had been named bishop in 1984.</p>
                <p>While the people of Guam coped in the mid-1980s with the old familiar problems of inadequate elec- tric power, educational and medical deficiencies, and poor roads, an upturn in Guam’s economy was gaining momentum owing primarily to a mas- sive buildup in Japanese tourism and investments on Guam. Tourism grew because of the Marianas’ location; the islands are the nearest and least expen- sive destination in the United States for Japanese travelers in addition to being marketed as a “tropi- cal paradise” in typical American advertising hype. By 1984, private-sector employment on Guam had jumped nearly 28 percent over 1982. Northwest Airlines joined Continental-Air Micronesia, JAL, and All Nippon Airways in providing regular flights in and out of Guam. A sad note was the decline of Pan Am, which ceased flights to the island in 1984. By this period tourism was adding about $200 mil- lion a year to Guam’s economy, and property values in the Tumon hotel area and then all over the island began to rise.</p>
                <p>Two events that symbolized the ongoing geo- political value of Guam to the United States were stopovers by President Ronald Reagan. He landed at Andersen AFB in April 1984 en route to China and again in April 1986 on his way to Tokyo. He made no comment about Guam’s quest for com- monwealth but talked of the ongoing Cold War. At the time, the air force still kept 150 nuclear bombs and 60 SRAMs (short-range attack missiles with nuclear warheads) in 130 permanent concrete bun-</p>
                <p>253</p>
                <p>kers at Andersen, while the navy stored 45 nuclear artillery projectiles, 75 nuclear bombs, and 98 nu- clear depth charges in the 312 permanent concrete bunkers at the Naval Magazine, according to pub- lished reports.</p>
                <p>In February 1986, Guam’s people watched with direct interest as Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown. Marcos and his wife Imelda were flown to Guam by the United States (he was one of a number of dictators supported by Washington in the Cold War anticommunist politi- cal climate at the time). The deposed couple flew on to Hawai‘i, where Marcos died three years later. Imelda then returned to a political career in the Phil- ippines. A lesson for Chamorro activists from the overthrow of Marcos (and from the earlier U.S. de- feat in South Vietnam) was that American power in the western Pacific was not absolute and could be successfully challenged at the grassroots level.</p>
                <p>By 1986, hotel rooms on Guam numbered over 3,000, and the number continued to rise. They were needed: in 1988, over 585,000 visitors, predomi- nantly Japanese tourists, came to the island, a 55 percent rise over 1985. Unemployment fell. Not even the stock market crash of October 1987 on Wall Street slowed Guam’s boom. The island was becoming more sensitive to Japan’s economic health than it was to the U.S. economy. The tourist flow was facilitated when visas were no longer required after October 1988 for Japanese to visit Guam for up to fourteen days (visas, however, were still re- quired for visitors from the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and Korea).</p>
                <p>The surge in tourism sparked a boom in construc- tion, and H-2 workers again flooded into Guam, this time including Chinese, Koreans, and even Malaysians in addition to Filipinos. Many of these workers encountered the same exploitation between contractors and labor recruiters as had their prede- cessors, and the Guam Department of Labor and the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service would be just as ineffective as in the past in prevent- ing the exploitation.</p>
                <p>To finance infrastructure to support economic growth, the Bordallo-Reyes administration turned</p>
                <p>254</p>
                <p>to bond issues. These alluring bond _ initiatives, along with the growth of corruption from tolerable small-time bribery of officials for favors to big-time venality at the highest GovGuam levels, would lead to a tragic end for Governor Ricky Bordallo.</p>
                <p>Scoundrels, Scandals, and a Suicide</p>
                <p>Rumors, speculation, and finally news reports sur- faced by mid-1986 that the governor and other GovGuam officials were being investigated by a fed- eral grand jury. The U.S. attorney in charge of the case was K. William (Bill) O’Connor, a tough and experienced federal prosecutor. The FBI beefed up its Guam office for the investigation. Both political parties on Guam were preparing for the 1986 gu- bernatorial elections, so an investigation of his ad- ministration could not have come at a worse time for Bordallo.</p>
                <p>In the primary, the incumbent team was chal- lenged by Carl Gutierrez, running this time with Senator John Perez Aguon on the “Sunshine” tick- et. The Republicans also offered two tickets in the primary: Senators Tommy Tanaka and Antonio R. (Tony) Unpingco against Senators Joe Ada and Frank F. Blas. The Ada-Blas team campaigned un- der the attractive slogan “Mauleg” (“good” in Cha- morro) displayed in a benign blue color, notably on television, which was becoming important in politi- cal campaigning.</p>
                <p>Politics veered into uncharted waters three days before the primary, when a federal grand jury, like Spanish inquisitions of old, summoned the gover- nor before it. Bordallo read the jury a statement that called the federal investigation “a Republican conspiracy to oust him from power.” He refused to answer questions and stalked out. He was then indicted on eleven counts, including extortion, brib- ery, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and various conspiracy and wire fraud charges.</p>
                <p>These bombshell indictments came too close to the primary election to change the outcome. Bordal- lo-Reyes easily defeated Gutierrez-Aguon. For the Republicans, Ada-Blas beat Tanaka-Unpingco. The larger Democratic vote in the primary and Bordallo-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>Reyes’ polls as of the first week after the primary showed the incumbents would easily beat the Ada- Blas challengers in the general election. The Bordal- lo-Reyes lead, however, evaporated in the following weeks as reports of new accusations, plea bargain- ing, and more indictments against the Democrats spewed out in the media like an avalanche of dirty laundry.</p>
                <p>On September 12, Bordallo pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his attorneys asked that the tri- al be delayed until after the general election. The request was refused by District Court Judge Cris- tobal Duenas when prosecutor O’Connor revealed threats had been made on a witness’s life because he had agreed to provide evidence and testify against Bordallo. Trial was set for thirteen days before the November 4 general election but was postponed to January 1987 when the FBI uncovered alleged bribes to Bordallo in connection with a $300 mil- lion municipal bond issue.</p>
                <p>By the time of Bordallo’s indictment, the taint of corruption had already enveloped much of Gov- Guam. This taint was due to investigations, arrests, and trials of lesser GovGuam officials as well as Bordallo family members and business associates, even though some of the offenses predated his ad- ministration. Among such trials was the October 1985 conviction on extortion charges of former DOE Director Dr. Katherine Bordallo Aguon. Five DOE officials were indicted with her, and six ven- dors were implicated. Dr. Aguon ended up serving eighteen months in a federal prison in California. While she was in prison, her conviction was over- turned on appeal and remanded. She then made a plea agreement in which she accepted responsibil- ity for her crimes by pleading nolo contendere in return for $30,000 in fines with no imprisonment. She was released and resumed her work on Guam as an educator.</p>
                <p>In late October, Bordallo’s situation worsened when he blurted out at a UOG lecture and again at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon that he had received $10,000 as a “gift,” chenchule‘ in the gov- ernor’s words, from Kenneth T. Jones, a wealthy businessman. Jones was later fined $20,050 after</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>pleading nolo contendere to a misdemeanor for exceeding campaign donation limits. In all these and subsequent proceedings, Lieutenant Governor Reyes was never implicated. Eddie Reyes emerged from all the scandals of the second Bordallo admin- istration with his reputation for integrity unblem- ished and his support for Bordallo unwavering.</p>
                <p>In light of the adverse publicity from the federal indictments and subsequent revelations, it was no surprise when the Bordallo-Reyes ticket lost the general election to the Ada-Blas “Mauleg” team. Political scientist Dr. Joe Dizon, the pollster for the Ada-Blas campaign, stated, “Only one thing did him [Bordallo] in—the indictment.” Despite los- ing the gubernatorial race, the Democrats retained their majority in the Nineteenth Guam Legislature. Delegate Ben Blaz easily triumphed by a 29 percent margin over his Democratic challenger, retired army colonel and former brigadier general in the Guam National Guard Frank C. Torres, Jr.</p>
                <p>Bordallo’s troubles escalated on November 20 when the federal grand jury handed down a super- seding indictment against him on seventeen counts. New charges stemmed from the Ken Jones $10,000 “gift” and bribes related to the $300 million mu- nicipal bond project as well as a new extortion charge that involved government contracts. Bor- dallo entered a not guilty plea to the new charges, which he still maintained were politically inspired and prompted by overzealousness on the part of U.S. Attorney O’Connor. The bond project turned out to be a gigantic scam, involving not only Guam but also frauds on the mainland by the same bond brokers, a collection of audacious flimflam hustlers who made Levenson and Wilkinson of the GMHP scam look like amateurs.</p>
                <p>Back in March 1985, a short, balding man was shown into Governor Bordallo’s office. He had been referred to Bordallo by a prominent Washing- ton, D.C., attorney. The visitor was introduced as Dr. Frederick L. (Fred) Mann, a banker from To- ronto with a Ph.D. from the London School of Eco- nomics. Mann had established a bank on Saipan in 1984, and in partnership with a Wall Street invest-</p>
                <p>255</p>
                <p>ment banking firm, Matthews and Wright Inc., he was trying to package a multimillion dollar bond issue for the Northern Marianas Housing Author- ity. Fred Mann was charming, sincere, and utterly plausible as a banker.</p>
                <p>Mann proposed to Bordallo a $300 million tax- exempt GovGuam mortgage bond issue to finance construction of housing units on Guam through GEDA. A quick survey by Matthews and Wright showed Guam in need of over 4,000 such housing units in 1985. Money from the bond sales could be invested immediately in escrow (for example in high-yield U.S. Treasury bonds or trust funds) un- der an arbitrage process whereby GovGuam could earn profits estimated by Mann as $25 million from dividends until the bond money was shifted to finance construction of the housing. Arbitraged bonds, Mann argued, would allow GovGuam to get around a provision in the Organic Act that limits Guam’s public obligation bond debt to 10 percent of the assessed value of all land on the island. The limit was over $200 million in the mid-1980s, and the debt of previous bond issues was already near that amount.</p>
                <p>The arbitrage bond process was due to end by federal law in September 1986, so Guam had to ac- cept Mann’s deal quickly if the deal was to be made. Bordallo was already aware of arbitrage bonds as a means to finance infrastructure. He had attempted to float GovGuam bonds in the overly ambitious amount of $850 million in 1983 for development projects but was blocked by U.S. Treasury officials skeptical of Guam’s ability to repay the bonds.</p>
                <p>In October 1985, at Bordallo’s request the Eigh- teenth Guam Legislature authorized a nonrated municipal bond issue worth $300 million through GEDA for the construction of nearly 5,000 low- and medium-cost, multifamily housing units on Guam. The governor and other GovGuam officials then met in New York on Halloween, October 31, to sign the deal with Matthews and Wright executive Arthur Abba Goldberg (known in banking circles as “Abba Dabba Do” and “Abba Cadabra” for his flashy ways of bond financing) and Edward K. Strauss, a bond counselor. A consortium of twenty-</p>
                <p>256</p>
                <p>four housing developers was formed on Guam to construct the houses with money to be generated from the bond sales. Several of these developers in- vested (and some dropped out) in preparation for construction, and some even went to final closing for title to the land for their projects. As an added inducement, Matthews and Wright also agreed to underwrite another bond issue through GEDA for $1.85 million to construct a computer factory on Guam.</p>
                <p>Goldberg arranged financing of the bonds through a New Jersey credit union. Financing for the developers was through the Pittsburg National Bank, and the mortgages for land were escrowed through the Puller Mortgage Company on the main- land. All these entities and persons charged large— very large—up-front fees paid by the developers.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Matthews and Wright was un-</p>

                <p>derwriting other huge tax-exempt bond deals in about thirty U.S. municipalities. These bond is- sues amounted to a fantastic $2.3 billion. The deals were primarily in poor communities on the main- land that, like Guam, were in great need of hous- ing and financial assistance. Mann and Matthews and Wright were able to get away with such razzle- dazzle because municipal bonds, unlike corporate securities, were not reviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to sale under the freewheeling financial policies of the Reagan-Bush administration. Municipal bonds were floated pri- marily on the word of bond counselors, such as Ed- ward K. Strauss, under the old adage “Let the buyer beware.”</p>
                <p>Bordallo was alerted in July 1985 by the Depart- ment of Interior and again by a Guam Business News article in February 1986 that Mann and the</p>

                <p>bond scheme were questionable. The governor went ahead with the deal because Guam needed low-cost housing and because there was no clear evidence the venture was not sound. Meanwhile, Mann and Matthews and Wright had secretly wired payments for a “campaign contribution” of $70,000 through a Hong Kong front to pay vendors in Hong Kong for posters, brochures, and other campaign para- phernalia for the committee to reelect Bordallo- Reyes. These transactions were arranged by Bor- dallo’s economic adviser, John D. Gilliam, who was also in charge of Bordallo’s media campaign in the 1986 election.</p>
                <p>The FBI came across the Hong Kong payments</p>

                <p>257</p>
                <p>while gathering evidence on the earlier bribery case against Bordallo. Prosecutor O’Connor then con- fronted Gilliam, who agreed to provide evidence of the transactions in return for leniency on a charge of extortion of money from Fred Mann and on other charges of moral turpitude that involved failure to pay returns on stocks that he and his wife sold to GEDA and failure to repay GEDA loans for a com- munications company they owned.</p>
                <p>The whole flimsy house of bonds came crash- ing down in November 1986, when, in return for providing evidence for a reduced sentence, Gilliam pleaded guilty in Guam’s District Court to one count of wire fraud in the $70,000 “contribution”</p>

                <p>to the Bordallo-Reyes campaign by Mann and Mat- thews and Wright. Gilliam’s plea agreement in turn led to Bordallo’s superseding indictment.</p>
                <p>It turned out Fred Mann was really Manfred Loth- er Mann, born in Leipzig, Germany, before World War II. He had been convicted of defrauding a dying Toronto widow in 1984 of her savings of $64,000. His “Ph.D.” was an honorary degree bought from a Canadian Bible college. His Saipan bank had been an unlicensed shell with no assets. The credit union in New Jersey through which Mann, Goldberg, and Strauss “financed” bonds for Matthews and Wright was a front through which they floated fake checks. Fred Mann was a slick fraud who would have been exposed by even a casual background check.</p>
                <p>Mann and his conspirators all made money through up-front fees. The conspirators put up no money themselves, and the brokers sold no bonds, merely making it appear that they were selling them by fast shuffles of complicated fake documents. They siphoned off millions of dollars from all the deals they made throughout the United States, in- cluding over an estimated $14 million from the tax- payers and developers on Guam, money that was never recovered. No houses were constructed nor was the computer factory. The whole swindle was incredible in its boldness and cleverness.</p>
                <p>At Bordallo’s trial in January-February 1987, charges against members of his former staff and businessmen who had paid bribes were dropped in exchange for testimony against the former governor. The jury acquitted Bordallo of charges on the bond deal but convicted him on ten counts of the original charges of extortion, bribery, and conspiracy. On April 3, 1987, Ricky Bordallo was sentenced to nine years in prison, fined $35,000, and ordered to pay $79,600 in restitution. He appealed his conviction and settled down to write his memoirs while await- ing the appellate court decision.</p>
                <p>Matthews and Wright executive Arthur Gold- berg pleaded guilty in federal court on the main- land in 1989 to three counts of mail fraud; he paid $125,000 in restitution to GovGuam and served time in a federal prison. Counselor Edward Strauss pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony and was</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>disbarred. Matthews and Wright as a company was sued by many of the firm’s victims but got off in its Guam trial because of clumsy prosecution by Gov- Guam attorneys. Matthews and Wright remained in business.</p>
                <p>Under his plea agreement with O’Connor, John Gilliam was given five years probation plus fines and restitution. He paid these off through commu- nity service. Later he was hired by both Republi- can and Democratic administrations in government staff positions despite his involvement in extortion schemes back in 1975 as well as in the Mann case.</p>
                <p>As for Fred Mann, he fled to Canada, where he fought extradition for years after being indicted on fifty-two counts. He was extradited to New York in 1993, where in exchange for a guilty plea to one count of racketeering for bribery he was ordered to pay a mere $62,500 in restitution and a $30,000 fine and was sentenced to a tap-on-the-wrist five- month jail term.</p>
                <p>After the dramatic ups and downs of the Bordallo- Reyes years, many people on Guam welcomed the conventionality of the Ada-Blas administration. Prior to the 1986 general election, Ada announced that the Commonwealth Act “is the agenda for 1987 and 1988.” He reconstituted the Commission on Self-Determination under his chairmanship, and a vote on the draft act was held in August 1987 in- stead of at the regular legislative election so senators could again avoid taking positions on the act. Only 39 percent of Guam’s electorate turned out to vote on each of the twelve articles. The voters rejected Article 1 on the U.S.-Guam relationship and Cha- morro rights, and Article 7 on immigration.</p>
                <p>The commission then did a quick rewrite of the rejected articles and scheduled a new plebiscite on them in November 1987 at a special election to fill a seat in the Guam legislature vacated by the death of Senator (and respected historian) Pedro C. San- chez. The seat was won by Madeleine Bordallo, Ricky’s wife. Concerned that the act’s provisions on Chamorro rights might again be rejected, the OPI- R campaigned among Chamorros for a hunggan (“yes” in Chamorro) vote. Nearly all incumbent</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>and former political leaders of Guam except Filipi- nos urged a yes vote. More Chamorros turned out this time, and 58 percent of all registered voters ap- proved both articles.</p>
                <p>The new draft with its tougher demands now raised serious concerns in the U.S. military, which had heretofore been relatively passive in the pro- cess. In February 1988, CINCPAC commented to Washington that Guam appeared to wish a “quasi- independence status” with respect to Section 302 of the act, which would have required Washington to consult with Guam on national military and foreign relations issues, a requirement that no territory or even U.S. state enjoys.</p>
                <p>The revised draft act was submitted to Con- gress in February 1988 by Congressman Ben Blaz, who himself commented that the act was “fatally flawed” because it asked for too much. Congress then referred the bill for “study” (a bad sign in Washington) to an unwieldy Federal Interagency Task Force created in June 1988 with representa- tives from the Department of Interior, Defense, and twenty-one other federal agencies. In January 1989, the Republicans (who generally oppose significant changes in territorial policies) gained control of the White House. President George H. W. Bush appoint- ed Stella Guerra head of Interior’s Office of Territo- ries and Insular Affairs (OTIA) and chair of the new task force (dubbed by Guam’s media as BATFOG, the Bush Administration Task Force on Guam) to negotiate the commonwealth issue with Guam. In August 1989, a leisurely seventeen months after the act had been submitted to Congress, the task force released a long, detailed report critical of most of the commonwealth act’s provisions.</p>
                <p>Four and a half months later in December 1989, the House Subcommittee on Insular and Interna- tional Affairs—Won Pat’s old committee, by then chaired by Democrat Ron de Lugo, the delegate from the Virgin Islands—held a hearing in Hono- lulu on the draft act. Approval of the draft by de Lu- go’s subcommittee after further negotiations would likely have brought the act to the House floor for a vote in 1990. In other words, this was a turning point for the commonwealth effort.</p>
                <p>259</p>
                <p>Guam’s leaders, OPI-R activists, and many or- dinary Chamorros traveled to Honolulu to pre- sent emotional pleas in support of the act. De Lugo asked if GovGuam was prepared to negotiate com- promises in the text. Governor Ada answered that the commission would not negotiate major changes. Ada stated (as Congressman Udall had predicted) that the commission could not change the text since it had been approved by the people of Guam in a plebiscite. To Ada’s uncompromising stance, Ron de Lugo replied, “That road map...is designed for disaster, designed for failure... we have to be able to confer and compromise.”</p>
                <p>De Lugo then directed the federal task force (OTIA’s Stella Guerra had up to then stonewalled real discussions with Guam) to confer with the Guam Commission on Self-Determination to re- solve the differences over the act. This switched the negotiations from the congressional track to an ex- ecutive track in which Guam had to deal with Inte- rior and other agencies, such as Defense, tradition- ally opposed to changes in U.S. territorial policies. Even if Guam reached agreement with the executive officials, it would still have to go back to Congress for final approval. Furthermore, by Ada’s rebuff of de Lugo, Guam lost the invaluable bipartisan con- gressional support it had formerly enjoyed.</p>
                <p>Even worse for a negotiating strategy, Gover- nor Ada and the Guam commission discarded the understanding at the Albuquerque meeting that commonwealth was intended to make Guam an integral part of the federal system “in union” with the United States. Instead, Governor Ada presented a new aim: commonwealth was, he said, to be a “partnership that respects our [Guam’s] will.” This unyielding stance was applauded by many Chamor- ros and would help Ada-Blas to win reelection in 1990. Partnership, however, implies (as does mu- tual consent on all changes to the act) equality of sovereignty between Guam and the United States. De Lugo warned that if Guam’s new purpose was “really free association with a commonwealth label slapped on it...the whole process ends up, no mat- ter what you do, as a bitter, sour process.”</p>
                <p>That is what occurred. Ada and the Guam com-</p>
                <p>260</p>
                <p>mission now entered a period of years of frustrat- ing wrangling with BATFOG, all at considerable expense to Guam’s taxpayers for high-priced Wash- ington lawyers. In retrospect, Guam had a rare win- dow of opportunity from 1983 through 1989 to get the commonwealth act passed by direct submission to, and compromises with, sympathetic Congresses under Democratic majorities, thereby bypassing executive agency objections. That window was closed primarily by Governor Ada, not by the U.S. Congress.</p>
                <p>While Guam’s Commonwealth Act was bogging down owing to lack of compromise between Wash- ington and the Ada-Blas administration, the Cold War international setting was undergoing a tremen- dous transformation. By the late 1980s, USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in Moscow were leading to the breakup of the Soviet Union as an em- pire and to the death of communism as a threaten- ing ideology. For Guam, the impact of geopolitical changes began back in 1980-1981 when the seven Poseidon missile submarines at Apra Harbor were withdrawn, leaving only attack submarines still op- erating out of Apra with the Proteus as tender.</p>
                <p>In the mid-1980s, prepositioned ships of the Mili- tary Sealift Command began to cruise out of Apra Harbor. Crammed with vehicles, provisions, and munitions, these cargo ships were ready for im- mediate logistical backup of military interventions by the United States in conventional conflicts such as the 1991 Persian Gulf War. A major change in the air force presence on Guam came in September 1990, when SAC’s last fourteen B-52 bombers were phased out of Andersen AFB. The B-52s along with the navy’s missile submarines had been among the most durable and effective weapons of deterrence in the successful containment of the Soviet Union throughout the post-World War II era. As an op- erational base for those systems, Guam played an incalculably valuable role for the United States in the containment strategy.</p>
                <p>Despite the pulldown of U.S. strategic operation- al forces, Guam continued to be a key communica-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>tions and support base for CINCPAC resources in the Pacific and Asia. In fiscal year 1990, military expenditures on Guam reached an all-time high of $895 million before declining thereafter. By then, GovGuam officials and Chamorro-rights activists were pressing for the shift of the Naval Air Station to Andersen AFB and transfer of Tiyan airport to civilian control. In the meantime, large military ex- penditures and expanded Japanese tourism and in- vestments produced the most hectic economic boom in Guam’s history during the late 1980s and into 1990-1991.</p>
                <p>By then Japan’s obte (lit., its “big hand”) domi- nated Guam’s development. The Japan Travel Bu- reau was the largest tour wholesaler for Guam and helped keep the island’s hotel rooms at an 80 per- cent occupancy rate. Japanese-financed high-rise luxury condominiums sprang up by the dozens. The boom in the late 1980s transformed much of Tamuning and Tumon into ill-planned part-Amer- ican, part-Japanese transcultural clutter. Harmon, already chaotic through lack of planning, became a maze of warehouses, garages, and a teeming week- end flea market. Prostitution in the form of “mas- sage parlors” proliferated in Tamuning, and the first HIV cases appeared on the island, followed by deaths from AIDS.</p>
                <p>There were also benefits from the tourist boom. Guam’s first large-scale, fully enclosed shopping center—the Micronesian Mall—opened in October 1988 between Harmon and Dededo. In 1989, a big, glitzy dinner theater, the Sand Castle, with excellent Las Vegas-style shows, opened in Tumon. Huge golf course-condominium developments for Japanese tourists rose along the Mangilao-Marbo coast and in the Manengon area, where fifty years earlier Cha- morros had huddled in concentration camps under Japanese bayonets. All this brought a rise in salaries to the private sector and in taxes for the GovGuam treasury.</p>
                <p>The Department of Public Works struggled con- stantly to upgrade Guam’s highways but never suf- ficiently to cope with the enormous growth of ve- hicular traffic. Low shipping costs from Japan and a steady exchange rate favorable to the yen against</p>
                <p>UNFINISHED QUESTS 1980-1990</p>
                <p>the dollar resulted in sales of tens of thousands of Japanese-made trucks and cars on Guam in the 1980s. By 1990, 100,796 vehicles were registered for the island population of 133,152. With no reli- able public bus system on tiny Guam, traffic jams at peak hours became the norm on the main roads, at times approaching gridlock in the not infrequent power outages.</p>
                <p>In 1986, the transformation of the TTPI districts other than the CNMI into the FSM and the Repub- lics of the Marshalls, and later Palau, opened the gates for Micronesian migration to Guam. Under the compacts of free association between Washing- ton and the new states, the citizens of these states are treated as U.S. nationals and may travel with- out visas to U.S. areas. Enticed by Guam’s boom, thousands of Micronesians—mostly from Chuuk (formerly Truk) in the FSM—began pouring into the island in the late 1980s. Additionally, Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese as well as the continued in- flow of Filipinos, both as legal and illegal resident aliens, swelled the non-Chamorro population. The new Micronesian migrants to Guam now included a high proportion of women and families, and thus these newcomers did not tend to marry into local families and be absorbed into Chamorro culture as did the predominantly male immigrants in earlier times.</p>
                <p>As will be discussed in the next chapter, these expatriates filled many labor needs, but thousands also qualified for welfare assistance, medical help, and public education once resident on Guam, add- ing to the island’s already overloaded social infra- structure. They often had to crowd into inadequate housing since the Ada-Blas administration, unlike every previous administration since Governor Leon Guerrero’s, failed to initiate large public housing projects. The result was a shortage in low- and me- dium-priced housing by the 1990s alongside a glut of high-priced luxury condominiums built mostly for Japanese.</p>
                <p>Human population pressure began to overstress police capabilities and to jam court calendars on Guam. The quality of island law enforcement and the judicial processes deteriorated. A new prison</p>
                <p>261</p>
                <p>in Mangilao turned out to be too small and nearly as easy to escape from as its predecessor. Firearms and ammunition of all kinds were easily obtained on Guam, legally or illegally. As a result, from 1986 through 1990, the island’s crime index rose by 39 percent, or nearly 10 percent per year. The increase in crime was over three times faster than the popula- tion growth of 2.3 percent per year on Guam in the same period. The island was beginning to show, in the words of ecologist Garrett Hardin, the Malthu- sian demostat, whereby the human carrying capac- ity (the number of people multiplied by the physical quality of life) was being overloaded. According to Hardin, demographic stress through overpopula- tion causes diseconomies of scale in human socie- ties. The diseconomies are manifested by mounting pollution in the environment, growing ineptitude in public services, creeping political malfunction, and social destabilization as traditional values erode.</p>
                <p>By 1990, population growth and development had transformed the island into a multiethnic, non- traditional community. On the positive side, un- employment at about 2 percent was the lowest in years, and local incomes soared to the highest lev- els in Guam’s history. Gated housing developments were being constructed for Guam’s growing up- per middle class. On the negative side, the price of profit brought pollution and destroyed the habitat of indigenous flora and fauna. Trash and junk ve- hicles littered the edges of Guam’s roads, masked by the island’s verdant tropical vegetation and quite impervious to cleanup efforts mounted spasmodi- cally by GovGuam and volunteer groups. Pollu- tion from the huge and ever-growing garbage dump at Ordot in the center of the island and the use of pesticides and irrigation on golf courses and subdi- vision lawns began to contaminate the water lens and wells. Many of Guam’s reefs were dying from silt runoffs from construction sites. Even more omi- nous for the future, Guam’s freshwater aquifer was fluctuating and perhaps dropping, while no plans were under way to build additional reservoirs to the navy’s Fena Lake Reservoir that supplied much of the island’s water.</p>

Only about 500 fanihi, the Marianas fruit bat, survived on Guam by 1990. Koko, Guam’s unique flightless rail, num- bered a mere fifty birds, and overfishing was reduc- ing offshore fish populations. In an irony of nature, the annual red tide of “San Vitores’ blood” in Tu- mon Bay, formerly considered miraculous mani- festations of God’s concern, ceased to appear. The high-rise hotels along the beach had disrupted the</p>

                <p>Much construction had a detrimental effect on the natural environment since the Territorial Land Use Commission and the Department of Public Works nearly always granted zoning variances and building permits to projects in the absence of effec- tive long-range plans for island development. The permit process and its integrity bogged down under the load of requests, so senators repeatedly passed laws to rezone the property of individuals and de-</p>

                <p>velopers who wished to bypass the slow regular per- mit process of land management. Hundreds of these questionable spot-zoning laws were passed. The legislature itself by the 1990s was an oversized bu- reaucracy with one of the largest staffs and budgets proportional to constituents in the entire United States. With no real controls on spending by the leg- islatures and administration officials, GovGuam’s deficit continued to grow.</p>
                <p>GovGuam’s inadequacies were manifold, yet compared with other U.S. territories—notably the CNMI, where frenzied development severely over- stressed local governmental capabilities—Guam</p>
                <p>263</p>
                <p>looked good from the Department of Interior’s viewpoint. The June 1992 Interior report on the “State of the Islands” (all U.S. territories except Puerto Rico) blandly concluded, “The Government of Guam is perhaps the best administered of the United States insular area governments.” In fact, by the 1990s, Guam for the first time had surpassed a U.S. state in per capita income. The 1990 U.S. cen- sus (with 1989 figures) showed Guam at $9,929, Mississippi at $9,648, and the U.S. national per capita income at $14,420. In the forty-five years since World War II, Guam had moved from a Third World to a First World economic status, except for reliable electric power. The boom would burst in the recession that began in 1991-1992, but until then Guam wore the happy face of excess.</p>
                <p>As the decade of the 1990s began, one resident no longer involved in the hectic development of Guam was former Governor Ricky Bordallo. On Wednes- day, January 31, 1990, after lunch and an interview for a local magazine, he drove off alone in his jeep. He was dressed as usual like a farmer in a T-shirt, faded blue denim jeans and jacket, and a wide- brimmed straw hat.</p>
                <p>His court appeals had been only partially success- ful. In 1988, the Ninth Circuit Court overturned eight of his convictions (prosecutor O’Connor, it turned out, had been overly zealous after all) but upheld the convictions on conspiracy to obstruct justice and witness tampering. Bordallo then ap- pealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it refused to hear the case. In December 1989, he was resen- tenced by District Court Judge Duenas to serve four years on the remaining convictions.</p>
                <p>The last day of January was the day he was to de- part to report to a federal minimum security facility in California. That afternoon, he drove his jeep to the little oceanside park in Agana at the Paseo Loop, where the great bronze statue of Quipuha gazes to- ward the green hills of Guam beyond the streams of traffic that flow along Marine Drive. Bordallo parked his jeep and walked to the foot of Quipuha. Repairs had recently been done to the statue, and a length of chain still lay at the base of the monument.</p>
                <p>264</p>
                <p>There was no one close by except some road re- pair workers on Marine Drive. Bordallo had not told anyone of his intentions. Overhead, the north- east trade winds swept clumps of sunlit clouds across a typically bright blue sky, and white fairy terns darted in flight over the nearby beach where Father San Vitores had stepped ashore on Guam long ago.</p>
                <p>With his back to the statue and to the American- ized postmodern world beyond, Bordallo placed about him hand-lettered placards he had made. The signs asked for forgiveness and called for justice. He draped a Guam flag around his shoulders in a final symbolic gesture. Then he removed a loaded .38-caliber pistol from his jacket pocket. Bordallo placed the end of the gun barrel against his right temple and squeezed the trigger.</p>
                <p>He fell on the Guam flag, by then splattered with his blood. His right ankle became entangled in the</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I5</p>
                <p>chain on the apron as his legs jerked spasmodically. By the time the police responded to a road worker’s emergency call, they found the former governor still breathing but beyond help. An ambulance took him to the U.S. Naval Hospital, where he died. He was sixty-three years old.</p>
                <p>Like Quipuha, Ricardo J. Bordallo was over- come by a tragic destiny imposed from without and abetted from within. Both leaders failed their people, but the people themselves went on with a sovereignty of spirit and a sturdy sense of commu- nity that have always redeemed them despite the in- adequacies of the island’s leaders and governments during centuries of colonial rule. The people of the island would need these qualities in the years ahead, when failure of the quest for commonwealth, mas- sive supertyphoons, and a severe and long-lasting economic recession would again nearly bring them to their knees.</p>

                <p>Economic Setbacks and Political Status Stalemate</p>
                <p>After the shock of Ricky Bordallo’s death, the 1990s on Guam started off with considerable optimism. The economy was booming with tourists flocking in from Japan. The U.S. military presence rose in 1991 in support of another distant war, this time against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq for invading Kuwait. Japan’s ebullient economy (called Japan Inc. in the media) was being lauded as an example of govern- ment-—private enterprise cooperation, which ap- peared to be the path to prosperity. Commonwealth with greater local self-government for Guam still seemed attainable, and the pro-business, pro-Cha- morro-rights Republican administration of Ada- Blas was confident of the future.</p>
                <p>For the citizens of the island, living conditions in 1990 were better than ever: employment was at an all-time high; every family had one or more vehicles, mostly Japanese-made cars and pickup trucks; live television with CNN news and sports events came by satellite from the U.S. mainland; and the island’s favorite traditional sport, cockfighting, could be en- joyed (and bet upon with much drinking of beer) at two big arenas (the Dededo Game Club, owned by former senator Ed Charfauros, and the Mangilao King’s Court) and at village cockpits every week- end. Hotels and condominiums in Tumon and Aga- na Bay were crammed with prosperous Japanese tourists, many of whom came to Guam just to play</p>
                <p>golf or, for young couples, to be married in elabo- rate Western-style weddings at chapels built at ho- tels for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Along with the business boom, Chamorro politi- cal activism continued to grow as a consequence of the treatment of Ricky Bordallo, who became an icon for indigenous self-determination. The OPI-R was still influential, particularly with the reconsti- tuted Commission on Self-Determination and ef- forts to gain Washington’s approval of the draft commonwealth act. The old Guam Landowners Association remained a presence through the per- sistent agitation (for return of land by the U.S. mili- tary) of Tony Artero, a U.S. Navy retiree and son of Antonio Cruz Artero (George Tweed’s savior in World War II), much of whose family land had been appropriated by the military after the war.</p>
                <p>Chamorro activism became more militant when a new group, the Chamoru Nation (Nasion Cha- moru), emerged in 1991 with Angel Leon Guerrero Santos as spokesman. A former air force noncom- missioned officer, he became an aggressive advocate for Chamorro rights and a hostile opponent of fur- ther immigration to Guam. He shaved his head ex- cept for a black ponytail like precontact Chamorros and imparted a grassroots dynamism to indigenous rights as a low-status manak‘papa movement in contrast to the OPI-R, which was led largely by aca-</p>

                <p>266</p>
                <p>demics, business people, and others with much of the old elite manak‘kilo and taotao ge‘hilo‘ image.</p>
                <p>Angel Santos led several protests against mili- tary blockages of private property, and in 1992 the Chamoru Nation, represented by attorney Michael F. Phillips, won a case against GovGuam that re- quired implementation of the 1974 Guam Land Trust Act for the return to Chamorros of Gov- Guam land obtained from the military. However, the process bogged down because of tangled prop- erty claims and political interference. The public- ity generated by Santos and the Chamoru Nation showed the value of direct action through street protests and class action suits against perceived re- pression of Chamorros. Santos went on to be elect- ed to the Guam Legislature and would eventually, but unsuccessfully, run for governor. His popularity strengthened the uncompromising stance of Gov- ernor Ada, and later of Governor Carl Gutierrez, against changes in the commonwealth act by Wash- ington officials, or the “Feds” as they were often called.</p>
                <p>In cultural matters, heightened Chamorro con- sciousness was expressed by playwright Peter Onedera, who wrote and directed dramas in Cha- morro as well as in English. Onedera, as head of the Chamoru Language Commission, would in the coming years lead in the development of a new in- digenous orthography that in 1994 would officially change the spelling of Chamorro words and names of villages and towns (notably Hagatfia in place of Agana in both English and Chamorro). Popular new musicians Jesse Rios and Ruby Santos joined older artists like Jimmy Dee, Johnny Sablan, and “J.D. Crutch” Duenas not only in performing but also in recording their music with Chamorro lyrics. A Chamorro photographer, Manny Crisostomo, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. A part of this Cha- morro renaissance was the publication in the 1990s of a series of public school texts—the Hale‘ ta (Our Roots) books—under the direction of Dr. Katherine Aguon in English and some Chamorro for primary and secondary public school courses. These books, written by Chamorros and subsidized by GovGuam, gave insider perspectives on local traditions and his-</p>

                <p>With political and economic conditions rosy on Guam, the first task facing the Ada-Blas administra- tion in 1990 was to win reelection in the fall elec- tion. Their biggest assets were Republican unity and support of many Chamorros because of Governor Ada’s uncompromising stance on commonwealth issues. Another Republican asset was the political disarray of the Democratic Party. Ricky Bordallo’s suicide left the party divided between two factions: on one side were the shaken followers of Bordallo, and on the other side the Carl Gutierrez Sunshine faction that had challenged Ricky in the past. For the primary in September, the Bordallo followers put up a ticket of Rudy Sablan and Eddie Reyes, both former lieutenant governors under Ricky. Carl Gutierrez, a senior senator, shrewdly decided not to run.</p>
                <p>But any hope of Democratic Party unity was frac- tured when Madeleine Bordallo (then a senator) de- cided to run in the primary with Senator Jose (Ping) Duenas. Gutierrez supported the Bordallo-Duenas team, and it easily won the primary, thereby alienat- ing many of Ricky’s old supporters, who stayed at home in the general election in November. In the general election, Gutierrez withheld his support from Bordallo-Duenas (presumably so he would be the Democrat candidate in the 1994 election, which is what occurred). As a result, in the November 1990 election the Ada-Blas ticket crushed the Dem- ocrats by nearly 14 percent, the largest margin since the 1970 election. The Guam electorate was appar- ently not yet prepared to see a woman as governor, but the fact that Madeleine ran a good campaign and as Ricky’s widow would condition the public to be more accepting in coming elections.</p>
                <p>With the local political deck cleared, Governor Ada declared that attainment of commonwealth was the new administration’s top priority. The Commission on Self-Determination (now referred to as “Team Guam”) went on arguing with the Bush Administration Task Force on Guam (BATFOG) of the Bush-Quayle administration in Washington in thirteen contentious sessions from 1990 to August</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>1992 with no resolution of basic differences over the draft commonwealth act. The Feds still wanted mu- tual consent limited to what the CNMI was given; the Guam side still wanted mutual consent to ap- ply to military bases, immigration, trade, and oth- er substantive matters. Although some “qualified agreements” (that is, subject to later change) were reached on technical matters, the talks staggered on with mounting obduracy on each side, which was a far cry from the “Spirit of Albuquerque” back in 1983 when Ricky Bordallo and U.S. Congressman Manuel Lujan agreed compromise was needed on both sides.</p>
                <p>Chances for compromise over the draft common- wealth act waned further after the 1992 election for Guam’s congressman in Washington. Incum- bent Republican Ben Blaz was beaten by Democrat Robert A. Underwood, the grandson of former U.S. Marine James H. Underwood who had married Ana Martinez before World War I and later became post- master of Guam. Robert Underwood, an articulate and witty professor with a doctorate in education, taught Chamorro studies at the University of Guam, where he retired as academic vice president in 1992 before entering electoral politics.</p>
                <p>A longtime advocate of Chamorro rights, Dr. Underwood was one of the early members of the OPI-R and a leader in taking the Chamorro cause to the United Nations. He stated in public that he sup- ported free association for Guam (but would later endorse commonwealth status when he became a candidate for governor). His election to Congress as a Democrat came just before the Republicans resumed control of the U.S. Congress under Newt Gingrich in 1994, thereby placing Guam’s junior congressman in the minority (as Guam’s voters had done previously in electing Republican Ben Blaz to Democratic congresses), where he was not in a posi- tion of power to push commonwealth as Won Pat had done. Robert Underwood would dutifully re- submit Guam’s commonwealth act with no changes and mild enthusiasm as a bill in Congress each ses- sion, but no congressional action was taken.</p>
                <p>In January 1993, commonwealth hit another snag when BATFOG unilaterally issued a report (it</p>
                <p>267</p>
                <p>was supposed to be a joint U.S.-Guam report) just days before the new U.S. president, Democrat Bill Clinton, assumed office. In its report, BATFOG un- expectedly reneged on every agreement on technical matters reached over the previous two years. Infuri- ated by such rude treatment, Governor Ada asked President Clinton to name a personal representative to conduct negotiations with Guam. This request was honored and BATFOG disbanded. Guam then found itself locked into new negotiations on the ex- ecutive track over the next three years with a series of appointed White House intermediaries, each of whom would be greeted by Guam’s leaders as some- one who would somehow help in Guam’s status quest, only to disappear in short order.</p>
                <p>While the stalled political status efforts were an ongoing frustration, a local issue of more direct concern to the island people had erupted. That is- sue was abortion, which had been ruled legal by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade and was made legal on Guam by a 1978 law. These steps contradicted fundamental religious beliefs of the conservative pro-life Catholics on Guam who still comprised the majority of residents on the is- land. In March 1990, the Guam Legislature passed a bill that repealed the 1978 Guam law and banned abortions and solicitations for them except when a woman’s life was in danger.</p>
                <p>Governor Ada signed the bill, which became P.L. 20-134. A week later, several medical groups, three gynecologists, and an Episcopalian priest filed a law- suit in the U.S. District Court on Guam against Gov- ernor Ada and other officials, challenging the law’s constitutionality. Archbishop Anthony Apuron sup- ported the new law and threatened in a television interview to have Catholics who opposed it excom- municated, making it an issue of the separation of church and state. The U.S. District Court, however, immediately issued a restraining order against the law and in August 1990 ruled P.L. 20-134 to be in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The ruling was then challenged by Governor Ada in the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Americans United for Life participated in opposing the Guam law,</p>
                <p>268</p>
                <p>broadening the case beyond just a Guam issue. The Ninth Circuit rejected Ada’s appeal, holding that Guam is a “federal instrumentality” bound by the equal rights doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment. Guam’s P.L. 20-134 was nullified, and abortion is still legal on Guam.</p>
                <p>Statesiders on the island tended to view the court’s decision as a put-down of Governor Ada, but many Chamorros viewed the governor’s stance as a justified defense of local values, even though opposition to abortion had been introduced by Je- suit missionaries and was not a precontact Chamor- ro norm. Thus Ada’s unsuccessful antiabortion ef- fort paradoxically strengthened him in local politics and in his opposition to any watering down of the draft Guam commonwealth act.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the good economic times began to fade like Guam’s blue skies before a typhoon. The down- turn was caused principally by two external factors: (1) recession in Japan, which gathered force after 1992 and cut the flow of money from tourism and Japanese investments on Guam, and (2) a substan- tial reduction from 1993 to 1995 in the U.S. military presence on Guam after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War and reduced the role of the island as a base for forward deployment of U.S strategic weapons systems in Asia.</p>
                <p>What made the Japanese recession so damaging to Guam’s economy was its suddenness and sever- ity. The booming 1980s had made Japan the sec- ond largest economy in the world, but the govern- ment was underwriting an enormous public debt that caused a huge and artificial inflation of prop- erty values. A reevaluation of the Japanese yen by about 50 percent against the dollar in the 1980s (from ¥245 per dollar to ¥120 to the dollar) raised Japanese consumer confidence and investments, and spurred inflation of property values. By 1989, the peak year of the property bubble, the value of Tokyo real estate alone was estimated to be equal to that of the entire United States. Then the bubble burst in 1991-1992, sending out an economic tsu- nami across the Pacific that swamped small econo- mies like Guam’s.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>By 1998, the value of Tokyo property would drop by an enormous 80 percent. By then Japanese bad debts had ballooned to about $1 trillion as re- forms began to stabilize the economy. Japan—and Guam—has yet to recover fully. What saved Japan from sliding into total economic depression was that it is not a debtor nation. It is one of the world’s largest producers of goods and is a leading lender and exporter of capital. The Japanese people also are great personal savers of money. Ten years after the real estate deflation, Japanese consumers still held $12 trillion in savings to cushion them.</p>
                <p>Guam, however, produces practically nothing, and the government has been in debt since Span- ish times. Moreover, consumer savings in the free- spending, American-credit-card economy of Guam are not significant. Guam had made a transition by the 1980s from heavy dependence on revenues from military expenditures and federal funding plus tax rebates to a growing reliance on tourism for revenues. After the bubble burst in Japan, well-off visitors dwindled and were replaced by low-spend- ing tourists. Visitor numbers continued to rise, but slowly, and GovGuam revenues from hotel occu- pancy taxes shrank from 1990 until 1995 by nearly 7 percent. At first the Japanese recession caused eco- nomic stagnation on Guam, but that slid into a re- cession by the mid-1990s that would be the longest and deepest in the island’s history. By 2003, Japa- nese low-budget visitors (those earning less than 3 million yen, or about $24,000, per year) accounted for 14 percent of Japanese visitors to Guam; by 2005 that number would rise to 34 percent.</p>
                <p>A basic indicator of the recession was that in 1996, for the first time in ten years, private sector wages on Guam fell around 3 percent when adjusted for annual inflation of about 1 to 2 percent, which meant the cost of living continued to rise while in- comes dropped. More residents began to live from paycheck to paycheck. Unemployment on the island rose steadily over the next ten years from a low 2 percent in 1990 to a high of 16 percent in 2000, when it began to fall slowly. Yet GovGuam payrolls (still the single largest source of income on Guam) did not shrink appreciably, so the government fell</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>deeper into debt to pay salaries, the retirement fund, educational and medical systems (by then heavily weighed down by Micronesian migrants), and a host of other obligations while revenues from taxes stag- nated. The adverse impact of the Japanese recession deepened when in July 1997 the Thai baht plunged in value, dragging the East Asian region into a reces- sion that lowered tourism across the Pacific.</p>
                <p>All this was bad enough, but the economic situ- ation was made more tenuous when the U.S. mili- tary downsized its presence on Guam at the same time revenues from tourism were falling. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 along with the seeming victory of the 1991 “Desert Storm” war against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, American military deployment overseas was reduced, and bases were eliminated within the United States and its territo- ries. This was accomplished mainly through the fed- eral Base Re-Alignment and Closure Commission (BRACC) in two phases, one in 1993 and the other in 1995. A part of the realignment was the transfer, based on a series of national studies called A-76, of many military support functions to civilian contrac- tors. These transfers resulted in a steep reduction in federal civilian employees as well as in uniformed military personnel on the island after 1993. Many Chamorros had to move to the states in order to retain their federal jobs and pensions.</p>
                <p>The navy withdrew its nuclear missile submarines and tender at Apra Harbor and then turned over its Ship Repair Facility (SRF) and 800-foot drydock in Apra Harbor to civilian owners. The turnover al- lowed Guam’s private sector to gain a facility that would otherwise have cost tens of millions to build, but the downside was that navy civilian employees were laid off and the subsequent civilian contract work for the navy has yet to utilize the facility to full capacity despite the later stationing of three Los Angeles class attack submarines at Apra.</p>
                <p>Of greater impact, BRACC, at the request of the Ada administration, also closed the Naval Air Sta- tion at Tiyan. It was transferred to GovGuam in 1993 under a lease, and its civilian use was adminis- tered through the Tiyan Reuse Authority. Some base houses were made available to Chamorros who</p>
                <p>269</p>
                <p>originally owned the land. The former officers club was given to the Guam police, while the air control tower, hangars, and related buildings were turned over to the Guam International Airport Authority. The navy administrative buildings and barracks were filled by GovGuam departments, agencies, and a variety of governmental offices that assumed the heavy burden of maintaining and repairing all fa- cilities other than the airport. After leasing the for- mer navy buildings for some years, most GovGuam agencies had to move elsewhere when it was found that lead had been used in the original paint and re- mained at unacceptable levels by contemporary fed- eral standards. This left dozens of houses, barracks, and other buildings at Tiyan empty and deteriorat- ing and unable to be returned to the original prop- erty owners by the Ancestral Lands Commission set up to process the returns.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Air Force meanwhile began to reduce its presence at Andersen AFB and closed a large hous- ing area at Andersen South, which remained largely unused for years except to house Kurdish refugees from the Gulf War in Iraq. By 1999, the air force would free up a stretch of beautiful northern beach at Jinapsen between Ritidian Point and Ritidian Beach, allowing access to the original local own- ers who had been restricted from their properties since 1952. The large Naval Computer and Tele- communications Station (NCTS, formerly abbrevi- ated NAVCAMS) in Finagayan, with its National Security Agency and military intelligence facilities, was consolidated, but not closed, as new advanced spyware was installed. The last U.S. Marine unit on Guam, C Company of the Marine Support Battal- ion, who were guards at NCTS and the Naval Mag- azine at Fena, would depart in 1998, ending—for the time being—a century of sometimes proud and at times less than glorious Marine Corps service on Guam.</p>
                <p>Another adverse impact of the military downsiz- ing in the mid-1990s was the reduction of Section 30 revenues to GovGuam under the Organic Act. These revenues came mainly from income taxes on military and federal civilian personnel, taxes that were turned over to GovGuam instead of going</p>
                <p>270</p>
                <p>back to the federal Treasury. Such revenue amount- ed to as much as $30 million a year at peak times of the military presence, or over double what was collected from local real property taxes at the time.</p>
                <p>The BRACC downsizing would reduce uniformed military personnel on Guam from over 11,000 in 1995 to some 6,500 by 2000, a steep decline of over 40 percent. Consequently, in the period 1994-1997, Section 30 money as a percentage of all taxes paid to GovGuam fell nearly 4 percent. Property taxes were increased by the Guam Legislature to make up for some of the lost Section 30 revenues, trans- ferring much of the cost of downsizing to the local</p>

                <p>taxpayers’ pocketbooks. When the Section 30 losses were added to losses from local income taxes (which produce over half of GovGuam’s income) of nearly 3 percent caused by bankruptcies and closures of many small businesses and rising unemployment, hard times came to the economy of Guam, hard times that would last the next ten years into the next century. Indigenous activists had long been critical of the military presence and pushed for the return of excess military lands on Guam to Chamorros. Now they were getting what they wanted, confirming the old Chinese adage “Be careful of what you wish for; you may get it.”</p>

                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>As if these economic downturns were not enough, Mother Nature inflicted another severe blow against the island when a massive earthquake struck on Au- gust 8, 1993, with an initial magnitude of 8.1 on the Richter scale followed by several large aftershocks. No deaths occurred, but damage was extensive, no- tably to a new—but thankfully not yet occupied, except for a few people working in a downstairs restaurant—ten-story high-rise hotel in Tumon that nearly collapsed and had to be demolished later. It was found that the Korean developer had bribed GovGuam building inspectors to approve an insuf- ficient foundation and substandard materials in the construction. Legal actions dragged on for years with the GovGuam inspectors being fired but the Koreans dodging accountability by corporate re- structuring until a settlement was reached in 2002.</p>
                <p>In this situation, the Republican Party had little to boast about as the 1994 elections neared. The two terms of Joe Ada and Frank Blas had been largely free of the corruption of the last Bordallo adminis- tration, and Ada had staunchly defended Chamorro rights. Guam, however, was in a recession, always a bad situation for the incumbent party. In addition, the Republicans would split into factions while the Democrats came together. The Democrats had unit- ed within a year of the 1990 elections when Carl Gutierrez and Madeleine Bordallo agreed to run on one ticket. The Republicans, for their part, split into two factions for the primary: one for the team of Tommy Tanaka, a longtime senator and business- man, and Doris Flores Brooks, Guam’s first female certified public accountant; and the other faction for Lt. Governor Frank Blas and Simon Sanchez II, son of the late senator and educator Pedro (Doc) Sanchez and grandson of Simon A. Sanchez, the pre-World War II educator.</p>
                <p>The Tanaka-Brooks team won the primary, but many disgruntled supporters of Blas-Sanchez de- fected in the general election to the Democrats when outgoing Governor Ada did not actively throw his support to Tanaka-Brooks. As a result, the Sunshine ticket of Gutierrez-Bordallo won the 1994 guberna- torial general election by over 4,000 votes. At long</p>
                <p>271</p>
                <p>last after several losing campaigns, Carl T.C. Guti- errez was governor.</p>
                <p>Two final, almost comical events occurred in the Ada-Blas administration in December 1994 before the Gutierrez-Bordallo inauguration. That month the White House National Security Advisor and the Chief Economic Advisor at a Singapore meeting of the Asian and Pacific Economic Council (APEC) laughed loudly when asked by the press if Guam was suitable for membership in APEC. This offend- ed the leaders of OPI-R and the Chamoru Nation, who then blocked the entrance to COMNAVMAR headquarters on Nimitz Hill and were arrested. Governor Ada rushed to the scene in support of the demonstrators and blocked the entrance with his official car. Governor-elect Gutierrez then scurried to join the demonstration, which had disbanded by the time he arrived. The next day, Ada blocked the gate at the naval communications station at Fina- gayan for a short time. This unprecedented grand- standing by Guam’s governors shocked the military and hardened Washington further against the com- monwealth act. The military had come to expect demonstrations by Chamorro activists but not by elected leaders who had sworn to uphold the law. New chain-link fences went up around military facilities throughout the island. The situation was diffused when Congressman Robert Underwood persuaded the National Security Advisor to make a quasi-apology.</p>
                <p>In Hard Times, Imagery over Substance</p>
                <p>When Carl Gutierrez was elected governor, he was probably the best qualified politician on Guam to steer the island through a recession. He had served several terms in the Guam Legislature, including chairmanship of the key Ways and Means Commit- tee and two stints as speaker. He had also been a member of the Commission on Self-Determination and was a strong fundraiser. All this experience made him highly knowledgeable of GovGuam fi- nances and political status issues. He knew how to move government funds around to meet needs and crises.</p>
                <p>272</p>
                <p>By the time Gutierrez succeeded Ada in January 1995, the commonwealth was something of a near- dead albatross around the new governor’s neck. He and other members of the reconstituted Commis- sion on Self-Determination (1995-1998, Guam’s sixth such commission) placated the public with up- beat statements whenever a breakthrough seemed possible: “We anticipate substantive action in the near future” (Gutierrez, October 1995); “we have made great progress” (senator and commission member Mark Forbes, January 1996). All setbacks were attributed to federal bureaucrats.</p>
                <p>The reality was different. Gutierrez directed his administration’s priorities away from political sta- tus. He focused on meeting shorter-term financial needs. On land issues, he pushed through an An- cestral Lands Act in 1997 that created an Ancestral Lands Commission to return properties to original land owners, notably at Tiyan as a result of the BRACC. He reduced GovGuam spending with a new financial plan and then used private sector money and volunteers to develop “Vision 2001,” a comprehensive economic development plan (with Madeleine Bordallo as chair) with goals to be ac- complished by 2001 through thirteen planning task forces for education, public safety, taxes, and so forth. This government-wide coordinated effort with citizen participation (perhaps the first in Gov- Guam history) helped to reduce inefficiencies and expenditures in GovGuam operations and curb some politicization in education and other func- tions. Vision 2001 did not address political status as an issue. The plan was also clever political imagery (the recession continued on, largely immune to lo- cal efforts to contain it) that could be pointed to by the Gutierrez-Bordallo team in the next elections in 1998 as a record of accomplishments, some of which remained to be fully implemented in a second term as an inducement for the public to reelect the team.</p>
                <p>Improvement of Guam’s public educational sys- tem was one goal of Vision 2001, but the military did not wait to see that happen. Long dissatisfied with the poor quality of Guam’s public schools since the teacher’s strike of 1981, the U.S. Department of</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>Defense set up its own system on the island in 1997 from grade school through high school for military dependents. By the 1999-2000 school year, some 2,400 students were enrolled and over 200 teachers employed by the Department of Defense Education Agency (DODEA) in military buildings at Nimitz Hill and elsewhere left empty by the BRACC down- sizing (COMNAVMAR headquarters had moved from Nimitz Hill to inside the naval base at Apra). The creation of the DODEA schools removed over $12 million annually that GovGuam had received for military dependents in Guam public schools.</p>
                <p>This financial and educational setback to Guam was not just a failure on GovGuam’s part, but also constituted a failure through years of neglect by the U.S. Government. Specifically, the Interior De- partment, abetted by the Justice Department in the courts and by indifferent Congresses, failed to assist Guam sufficiently as the island struggled with inad- equate funds for schools and public health services overloaded by the influx of poor migrant Microne- sians after the compacts of free association for the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands went into effect in 1986 for the FSM and the Marshalls and in 1994 for Palau. The overall impact costs im- posed on Guam, Hawai‘i, and elsewhere in the Unit- ed States by Micronesian migrants were estimated at over $70 million for 1995. Of that amount, the United States reimbursed Guam with only $2.5 mil- lion dollars in impact aid that year even though the largest number of migrants came to Guam. By 2003, GovGuam was receiving $4.2 million, a 68 percent increase in impact aid in eight years, or some 4 percent more annually, but the number of Micronesians resident on Guam had in the mean- time increased by an enormous 129 percent from 4,872 (4 percent of Guam’s population) in 1990 to 11,094 (14 percent of Guam’s population) in 2000, or nearly 13 percent annually.</p>
                <p>To enter Guam, or anywhere else in the United States and its territories, Micronesians need only submit a Form I-94 and a passport from their home state to immigration officials upon arrival. They do not need a visa and need not apply for a green card, as do Filipinos and other foreign immigrants. After</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>six months residence on Guam, Micronesians—em- ployed or not—qualify for the Medically Indigent Program (MIP) for hospital care, mostly free be- cause medical insurance is not required of them. Micronesians are also exempt from U.S. military service but may enlist. The free schooling and medi- cal support are highly beneficial to the poor Micro- nesian migrants and spur their movement to Guam, making them “jet people” who arrive by airliners rather than “boat people” as were the Vietnamese and other earlier refugees. But it is Guam’s taxpay- ers who bear most of the financial and social costs of this largesse imposed on them by Uncle Sam. No solution to this burden for Guam is in sight as of the early 2000s</p>
                <p>While Guam’s school system and health facilities were being inundated by Micronesian migrants in the 1990s, the accreditation of the University of Guam was once more being threatened. In 1987, with the election of Governor Ada, UOG President Jose Q. Cruz—a Bordallo Democrat—resigned and was replaced by Dr. Wilfred (Fred) Leon Guerrero, a boyhood friend of Governor Ada’s and dean of UOG’s College of Agriculture. Dr. Leon Guerrero, an excellent president, retired in 1994 and was succeeded by his vice president, Dr. John C. Salas, whose work was hampered by interference from the Board of Regents. He resigned in frustration in 1997 and was replaced by Dr. Jose T. Nededog, a retired naval officer with a doctorate in business administration. As president, Dr. Nededog began running the university autocratically as if it were a naval base. Short of funds due to the recession, Nededog reduced the faculty and filled tenure-track positions with limited-term and part-time profes- sors who could be jettisoned if funds dwindled. When the faculty (with many liberal statesiders) objected or filed grievances, the president retaliated against them. Faculty members complained to the university’s accreditation body, WASC, that there was “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation on the campus.”</p>
                <p>Interim WASC visits to the campus in 1997 and 1998 found a “culture of grievance” at UOG. De-</p>
                <p>273</p>
                <p>spite the institution’s troubles, by the year 2000 stu- dent enrollment had grown to over 3,500 with 23 percent of its $34.3 million budget federally funded. This made it one of Guam’s largest public invest- ments. In March 2000, WASC made a full-scale in- spection to see what was wrong. The WASC team found that out of nine standards for accreditation, UOG was deficient in part or in whole in seven stan- dards, and the university was placed on probation. The only unit that met the standards was Student Affairs and Facilities under Dr. Richard H.J. Wyt- tenbach-Santos. WASC scheduled its next full visit for July 2002 to see if UOG’s probation would be lifted, remain, or be downgraded to full suspension of accreditation.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, Dr. Nededog resigned in Au- gust 2000, followed by two acting presidents, while the legislature passed a law that restricted the gov- ernor’s power to select the university’s Board of Regents and president. In 2001, the regents hired a new president, Dr. Harold L. Allen. He had lived on Guam as a youngster and was an experienced aca- demic administrator. He was also the first full-time president of UOG who was not a Chamorro and who was not politically beholden to the governor. Dr. Allen faced a daunting challenge over the next year to eliminate probation with dwindling funds, an unhappy faculty, and low morale on the campus. He cooperated with the faculty and its union, hon- ored the faculty bargaining agreement, and under his firm hand the university met all WASC condi- tions. UOG was taken off probation in 2002.</p>
                <p>By 1997, it had became known from media re- ports that the Department of Defense was plan- ning to redeploy a brigade-sized force of 5,000 to 6,000 U.S. Marines from Okinawa (where the local people recurringly demonstrated for their removal) to Guam as a permanent move. The Japanese gov- ernment was to fund the base infrastructure for the marines on Guam but would not provide any im- pact assistance. The OPI-R, including Congressman Underwood, opposed the redeployment, while the business community and many ordinary residents welcomed the move as a needed shot in the arm for</p>
                <p>274</p>
                <p>the island’s economy. However, negotiations and preparations for the transfer dragged on for years into the middle of the first decade of the twenty- first century as other issues—primarily the rise of terrorism and the unanticipated lengths of the wars in Iraq and Afganistan—preoccupied Washington.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Governor Gutierrez came up with an innovative way of recharging political sta- tus efforts through the executive track on which Guam was stuck as a result of Ada’s policies. Guti- errez reportedly raised from Guam’s businesses and other public sources over $450,000 in soft-money donations for the national Democratic Party and $30,000 for the Democratic Governor’s Confer- ence, all of which made him one of the largest fund- raisers for Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign. Gutierrez also invited President Clinton to visit Guam. One of the governor’s aims, presum- ably, was to gain direct access to the Clinton White House to lobby for Guam’s commonwealth. How- ever (perhaps to protect himself from Chamorro ac- tivists such as Angel Santos), he still supported mu- tuality and self-determination by Chamorros and considered the draft act a “Contract with Guam,” which still implied partnership, not union, with the United States.</p>
                <p>Gutierrez did gain greater access to the White House, and President Clinton would visit Guam in 1998 and be warmly applauded by a large crowd at a public Adelup gathering. But the effort became meaningless when Clinton subsequently became em- broiled in, and preoccupied with, the scandal over his sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, leading to his impeachment by the House of Representatives but acquittal by the Senate. With status talks proving inconclusive, Gutierrez agreed with proposals of Chamorro activists to establish a new status body, the Commission on Decoloniza- tion, to take a different approach to political status. Meanwhile the old Commission on Self-Determi- nation remained in place but faded from activity. The new commission, under Governor Gutierrez as chair, included public members from the OPI-R.</p>
                <p>Established in January 1997, the new commission was to prepare for yet another vote on political sta-</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>tus choices, but this time only “native inhabitants” of Guam would be allowed to vote after registra- tion to prove they were natives. The voters would decide among only three final political statuses—in- dependence, free association, or statehood—in ac- cord with UN criteria for self-determination that do not mention (or preclude) commonwealth as an interim status. Natives were defined as “inhabitants of Guam in 1898 and their descendants who have taken no affirmative steps to preserve or acquire foreign nationalities.” In other words, it was to be a Chamorro-only vote.</p>
                <p>To identify eligible inhabitants, a registry was to be established by yet another new body, the Chamorro Registry Advisory Board. Registration turned out to be difficult, given the complexities of tracing families back to 1898. The Chamorro pub- lic also proved uninterested in having to go through the bureaucratic process of registering, but the new commission and board went on with their work, ab- sorbing much of the attention of Chamorro-rights activists in what would turn out to be a futile ef- fort to bring ethnic clarity to the multiethnic and multicultural complexity of Guam’s modern social fabric.</p>
                <p>While Guam was coping with recession and creat- ing yet another status commission, Congress at last scheduled a hearing on a bill for the draft common- wealth act before the House Resources Commit- tee. The hearing took place on October 27, 1997, when committee members listened to all three living Guam governors—Paul Calvo, Joe Ada, and Carl Gutierrez—and a number of other island leaders ap- peal for passage of the draft act without changes. Presidential representative John Garamendi told the committee the Clinton White House would not agree to the provisions on mutual consent, or on Chamorro self-determination, or on transfer of federal control of labor and immigration to Guam. For good measure, he also rejected a provision that would establish a joint U.S-Guam commission to re- view the applicability of federal law to Guam.</p>
                <p>The House committee was noncommital and took no further action. After three decades of ef- fort and well over $12 million spent, Guam’s quest</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>for commonwealth died quietly. Despite this long- anticipated rejection in Washington, back on Guam the Commission on Decolonization went on with its work, keeping the status issue barely alive with the lingering but vain hope that a new bill would some- how be introduced in the U.S. Senate after another status was chosen in the planned Chamorro-only vote.</p>
                <p>It was in the mid-1990s that a major reform was imposed on Guam’s free-wheeling legislature be- cause of cronyism, fractionalism, and excessive costs. In 1995, when the Twenty-third Guam Leg- islature, with a thirteen to eight Democratic major- ity, chose its leadership, internal bickering was so intense that one exasperated senator called the body “a parliament of whores” and “an incestuous pool of self-interest.” By then the legislature’s budget had swelled to over $60 million annually, with each sen- ator paid $55,000 a year plus enormous allotments for staffs and office operations ($427,000 each for majority senators; over $200,000 each for minority senators). For the years 1992-1994, the legislature overdrew its bank accounts for operations and pay- rolls (the legislature’s staffs were stuffed with feath- erbedding of political supporters) by an average of $9.5 million per year. Audits of 1993 to 1995 by the Interior Department’s Inspector General revealed the senators failed to account for $51.5 million in expenditures. The legislature’s finances were as tan- gled as a bowl of spaghetti.</p>
                <p>This extravagance by Guam’s senators was oc- curring during a recession when Governor Gutier- rez was trying to reduce GovGuam expenditures. All this was too much even for Guam’s forgiving citizens. Reform of the legislature had long been ad- vocated, and two reform initiatives were passed in the November 1996 legislative election that reduced the number of senators from twenty-one to fifteen, and placed a cap on the legislature’s budget. These reforms went into effect in the 1998 elections.</p>
                <p>Preoccupied with local affairs, the people of Guam were surprised in September 1996 when Guam’s geopolitical role once more manifested itself by the flow of almost ten thousand Kurdish</p>
                <p>275</p>
                <p>refugees through Guam by a U.S. military airlift out of Iraq. In the years after American withdrawal from Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein (who had been left in power by the Americans after his defeat) attacked the Kurdish people in the north of his country who had supported the United States and an independent Kurdish state. The Americans, who still controlled the airspace over Iraq’s northern areas, initiated an evacuation of the threatened population to the Unit- ed States. A principal way station for many of the Kurdish refugees was Guam, just as it had been for South Vietnamese refugees in 1975 after America’s defeat in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>On Guam, the stream of Kurds was housed from September 1996 through May 1997 in mili- tary bases and in buildings emptied by the BRACC downsizing. The Kurds were quietly transported onward to the mainland by military aircraft in an efficient operation. The use of the island again as a safe haven for aliens made little impact on Guam’s residents but showed once more that they had little say in the use of their island by Washington when it came to military needs.</p>
                <p>Of more dramatic impact on the islanders was the crash on August 6, 1997, of the regularly scheduled Korean Airlines Flight 801 from Seoul in a Boeing 747-300 while attempting to land at night at the Tiyan airport (by then renamed the A.B. Won Pat International Air Terminal). The disaster killed 229 of the 254 passengers—mostly Korean tourists— and crew. Some of the key Guam airport equipment was apparently not in operation and the Korean pilot was tired, but the cause of the crash was de- scribed officially as a controlled-flight-into-terrain by equipment or pilot failure. The crash put an end for a number of years to visits to Guam by Korean tourists, whose numbers had been increasing signifi- cantly prior to the crash.</p>
                <p>The tragedy of the Korean Airlines crash was fol- lowed by another disaster in mid-December 1997 when a massive supertyphoon named Paka swirled out of the Carolines toward the Marianas. The last major typhoons to strike the island were Superty- phoonYuri in December 1991 (which did not hit the</p>
                <p>276</p>
                <p>island dead-on) with sustained winds of 168 miles per hour and Omar in August 1992 with steady winds of 145 miles per hour. Two smaller “banana” typhoons also damaged the island in the 1990s: Russ in 1990 with 115 mile per hour sustained winds and Gay in 1992 with only 100 mile per hour winds. These storms caused considerable damage, but ever since Pamela in 1976, Guam was well pre- pared to cope with typhoons. Nonetheless, Paka would be devastating since many tin-roofed build- ings had proliferated, and the island population and infrastructure had grown considerably.</p>
                <p>Paka, with sustained winds of 146 miles per hour and gusts from 173 to an incredible 236 miles per hour, passed over northern Guam on December 16, 1997. It was so large that it had two eye walls, an outer one about 40 miles in diameter and an in- ner one 20 miles across. Sheets of tin roofing sliced through Guam’s air like razor blades, and most families huddled in their houses until December 18. Power and running water were out for over a week in central and northern Guam. No one was killed, but damage was estimated at nearly $600 million. FEMA, the military, and the Small Business Admin- istration were swiftly mobilized by President Clin- ton at Governor Gutierrez’ request and, along with the Red Cross and other charities, provided a rela- tively fast recovery. Over the next six months in the wake of Paka, GovGuam added over 2,400 jobs, a temporary jump of 6 percent, to its payroll of over 13,500 persons with federal disaster funds, giving some relief from the recession. Private sector jobs, however, continued to decline.</p>
                <p>One of the last major internal GovGuam fights in Governor Ada’s tenure had developed when bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress by Delegate Robert Underwood to make the Guam Supreme Court (which had been created in 1993 and opened for business in 1996 as a local appellate court) a constitutional court and independent administra- tively from the Guam Superior Court. These bills provoked a hostile reaction from the Superior Court judges and administrators, who had long ruled a lit- tle kingdom of their own as Guam’s third branch of</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>government. The Superior Court, for example, col- lects and keeps for itself more than $1 million a year in traffic fines. The court employs over 340 people with an annual budget of over $20 million. This kind of independence allowed the court’s adminis- trative director, Anthony (Tony) Sanchez, brother of Simon Sanchez II, to receive $108,000 in annual salary, and his deputy to get $95,000, both more than the governor receives. A number of the Supe- rior Court judges and staff had been appointed by Governor Ada and were Republican in their sym- pathies in Guam’s politicized judicial system. The three judges of the new Supreme Court, in contrast, tended to be Democrats in background.</p>
                <p>It would later be revealed that in 2002 Tony San- chez hired Washington Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and attorney Howard Hills (who for- merly worked as a navy lawyer for COMNAVMAR and then as a civilian for the Guam Commission on Self-Determination and the Guam Superior Court) to block Underwood’s efforts in Congress to estab- lish the new court. Sanchez apparently authorized a total of $479,000 in court funds to Abramoff and Hills in 2002. The lobbyists stalled Underwood’s first bill on the new court, but a second bill would be passed in October 2004. The problem was that Sanchez had paid Abramoff for his lobbying by increments of $9,000 in order to circumvent the requirement for bids for contracts over $10,000. Neither Sanchez nor Hills was held accountable for this sleight of hand in wasting the public’s money. Abramoff would plead guilty in 2006 in a Wash- ington court to charges of fraud and other crimes unrelated to the Guam Supreme Court, and he went to prison for seven years.</p>
                <p>The 1998 gubernatorial election meanwhile had started eighteen months early in April 1997, when the team of Angel Santos and Jose Toves (Pedo) Terlaje of the Chamoru Nation announced they were running as a Democratic ticket. By then Angel Santos was a senator and Guam’s most prominent Chamorro-rights leader. Terlaje was a retired police- man and Vietnam War veteran. The two political neophytes boldly ran under the HITA (We in Cha-</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>morro) slogan as candidates for the common people against the incumbent manak‘khilo leader of their own party, Carl Gutierrez, who was wealthy and had the party organization under his control.</p>
                <p>That control, however, was reduced when a third Democratic ticket challenged Gutierrez-Bordallo in the primary. This ticket was made up of two popu- lar young senators, Tom Ada (from a different Ada family than former governor Joe Ada) and Lou Leon Guerrero. Ada is a retired army officer, and Leon Guerrero is a nurse and daughter of a promi- nent banking family that owns the Bank of Guam.</p>
                <p>The Republicans united for the primary under former governor Joe Ada, who ran with three-term senator Felix Camacho, son of Guam’s first elected governor, Carlos Camacho. Republican unity, how- ever, was fragile since former Republican guberna- torial candidate Tommy Tanaka from the 1994 race switched his support to Gutierrez-Bordallo. These ingredients infused the 1998 elections with more bitterness and hostility than at any time in the past, according to a Joe Murphy column in the Pacific Daily News. In the Democratic primary race, Angel Santos accused a member of Gutierrez’ family (per- ceived by many to be Tommy, the governor’s son) of using drugs. Despite the accusations, Gutierrez and Bordallo won the Democratic primary by a nar- row 51 percent. The Santos-Terlaje and Ada—Leon Guerrero tickets then refused to endorse Gutierrez- Bordallo, and Santos called for an investigation of the police for cover-ups in drug and homicide cases. When a gag order was slapped on Santos by a judge, the HITA leader staged sit-ins at the Guam Attor- ney General’s office. Santos and his followers were hauled off in handcuffs before being released.</p>
                <p>All the in-fighting resulted in the Republicans taking twelve of the fifteen senate seats in the 1998 general election, dominating the legislature for the first time since the late 1970s. The gubernatorial race in the general election resulted in a near tie with neither ticket gaining a majority: Gutierrez- Bordallo received 49.82 percent to Ada-Camacho’s 43.56 percent, while 5.36 percent were blanks, overcounts (two candidates selected for one posi- tion), or write-ins, and the remainder void. After</p>
                <p>277</p>
                <p>intense debate for nearly two weeks, the Election Commission declared Gutierrez-Bordallo the win- ners. The decision was challenged in two suits by Ada-Camacho, one in the Guam Superior Court charging fraud and irregularities in polling and the other in the Guam federal District Court over what constituted a majority of votes. Ada-Camacho re- quested a runoff election under the “Santos Amend- ment” to the Organic Act (named for Senator Frank Santos, who authored the amendment in the 1980s) by which a candidate needs 50 percent plus one of the votes cast to win.</p>
                <p>The Superior Court ruled in favor of Gutierrez- Bordallo, a decision then appealed by Ada-Camacho to the Guam Supreme Court, where they lost; the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Ada-Camacho and mandated a runoff election. The District Court decision was then appealed by Gutierrez-Bordallo in January 2000 to the U.S. Ninth Circuit, which upheld the District Court decision for Ada-Cama- cho but stayed the runoff election until Gutierrez- Bordallo could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In January 2000, fourteen months after the election, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the Ninth Circuit opinion for a runoff election. Guti- errez-Bordallo won because blank and void ballots (which had caused the lack of a majority) cannot be counted as votes cast, thus giving the Demo- cratic ticket a slim majority. Robert Underwood meanwhile easily won his fourth (and next to last; he would run unsuccessfully for governor in 2002 and again in 2006) term as Guam’s congressional delegate.</p>
                <p>Gutierrez and Bordallo had been sworn back into office in January 1999 and had been running Gov- Guam on the basis of the original decision by the Election Commission. While waiting for the various court decisions to be untangled, Governor Gutier- rez made a high profile visit to New York in June 1999 to attend the UN General Assembly and the UN Committee on Decolonization to state Guam’s case for changing the island’s political status, but, as in the past, no substantive action resulted. The political status issue continued to die slowly.</p>
                <p>278</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, illegal immigration again became an issue when it was learned that by mid-1999 some 700 Asian illegals had been caught and an esti- mated 2,000 more were hiding on the island. These were predominantly Chinese from mainland Chi- na, which would not take back the illegals. With Guam’s jails and prison already overcrowded, the illegals were put to work by GovGuam collecting garbage and performing other menial tasks. Many of these illegals would end up being released owing to the muddled state of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement.</p>
                <p>The Coast Guard beefed up its patrols around Guam and the Marianas with C-130 aircraft and ships to reduce illegal immigration, but the flow continued at a lower rate. It is estimated that in the period 1987-1999 as many as 20,000 foreigners, le- gally and illegally, gained resident entry to the Unit- ed States through Guam, and some 15,000 of them (including many Filipinos, but not Micronesians, as discussed earlier) were naturalized as U.S. citizens through green cards. However, as noted earlier, by the year 2000 there were additionally 11,105 Mi- cronesian migrants from the freely associated states resident on Guam, according to official census sta- tistics. This totaled 45,000 alien residents, or about one-third of the island population, but thousands of these, particularly Asians and Filipinos, moved on to Hawai‘i and the mainland. The people of Guam tended to place the blame for this alien burden on the liberal immigration policies of the federal gov- ernment, particularly the laxity (from the Guam viewpoint) of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Discontent over the adverse impact on Guam of immigration and emigration in turn fueled much of the anger by the Chamoru Nation toward the U.S. federal government.</p>
                <p>With many of Guam’s problems continuing to be imposed from the outside in the late 1990s, the island’s government resorted to more drastic mea- sures to stay afloat. In 1999, the legislature imple- mented a buy-out program for early retirements by GovGuam employees. This step reduced the government payroll at the expense of the Guam Retirement Fund and was challenged in court but</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>implemented anyway. Cost-of-living (COLA) sal- ary allotments to government retirees passed years earlier by freewheeling legislatures had been greatly reduced beginning in 1993 with flat rates far below the individual retirement rates authorized by law.</p>
                <p>The private sector could not resort to such sleight of hand measures and went on suffering. In 1995, when a large new “Big Box” K Mart store opened, it was welcomed for its low prices, but it contrib- uted to more bankruptcies (up 30 percent in 1999) and closings of small retail businesses. It was esti- mated by the Business Almanac of Guam and the Northern Marianas that military expenditures fell by nearly 40 percent between 1994 and 1999 ow- ing to the BRACC downsizing, while construction contracting permits tumbled by close to 47 percent in the same five years.</p>
                <p>Worse, Guam was losing its younger population. The head of the island’s largest moving company re- ported a “mass exit of residents,” a “brain drain” in which “for every two families moving to the island, ten are leaving.” More and more of those depart- ing were “20-to-30-year[-old] couples and fami- lies” shipping all their possessions and even cars to Hawai‘i and the mainland. According to U.S. census figures, by 2000 there were 58,240 Chamorros liv- ing in the fifty U.S. states, more than on Guam, with the largest concentration, 21,000 people, in Califor- nia. Nonetheless, shipping and related industries on Guam lost an estimated 10 to 20 percent in revenues from 1994 to 1999 because of the fall in imports. On Guam, more and more groups of people, mainly Chamorros and Filipinos who did not qualify for the GovGuam Medically Indigent Program (MIP) but could not afford mounting medical insurance premiums, appeared on major street intersections to solicit funds for stricken family members and friends.</p>
                <p>These signs of economic downturn in the late 1990s did not cause as much dismay among the is- land’s citizens as did the collapse in 1999 of Guam’s major medical insurer, the Guam Memorial Health Plan (GMHP). Reorganized in the 1980s after the Jackie Wilkerson scam, GMHP by 1997 had about 45,000 subscribers out of the island’s population</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>of around 150,000 residents, and it had amassed by then a staggering debt of close to $10 million as premium payments did not keep up with mount- ing bills. Because GMHP was not paying its bills, the Guam Memorial Hospital (GMH) terminated its payment agreement with the insurance company, which then teetered on the edge of bankruptcy and default on obligations to its subscribers. GovGuam stepped in and negotiated an agreement to salvage the portion of GMHP for GovGuam employees under new coverage by Zurich Worldwide Group, a huge insurance company. Staywell, a long-estab- lished local company, took over administration for Zurich on Guam in early 2000 under the name Staywell Bronze with a debt of $2.5 million. All this maneuvering staved off bankruptcy by GMHP, but the Guam Memorial Hospital and other major users of GMHP sued the company for a total of over $11 million for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
                <p>The big losers in the demise of GMHP were the non-GovGuam subscribers and the hospital. When GMHP cancelled its commercial health care plans and dental insurances, as many as 30,000 non- governmental subscribers were left to seek other health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Many residents were unable to do so since premiums had gone up, swelling the ranks of the GovGuam Medi- cally Indigent Program and deepening GovGuam’s debts. The GMHP also worsened the already de- pressed situation of GMH.</p>
                <p>As of the year 2000, the still-unaccredited hospi- tal was short fifty-four physicians and was deeply in debt despite some $53 million in subsidies over the previous twenty years from the Guam Legislature to keep it going. The hospital situation worsened under the heavy burden of serving the influx of Mi- cronesian migrants who qualified under the MIP or simply did not pay their bills. By 2006, the GMH Nursing Supervisor estimated that almost half of the hospital’s patients did not pay for the services they received.</p>
                <p>Guam’s legislature, along with the governor, con- trols GMH and tends to favor local HMOs (for which Guam’s own poor and Micronesian migrants mostly do not qualify), some of which are owned</p>
                <p>279</p>
                <p>by prominent island families who make hefty do- nations to political campaigns. This politically in- cestuous medical and insurance situation on Guam favors corporations and the wealthier citizenry, as on the U.S mainland, and has yet to be reformed. Thus, much major surgery and the treatment of many serious illnesses for Guam’s civilian popula- tion are still done in Hawai‘i, on the mainland or in Manila through off-island referrals. Moreover, the mixing of politics and public administration led to more corruption among high-profile politicians and physicians, as would be exposed in the first years of the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p>New Century, Old Corruption</p>
                <p>With the recession still in force, the twenty-first cen- tury did not start off well for the people of Guam, so they were puzzled, then amused, when in mid- 2000 large electoral signs appeared all over the is- land with only one word—GERI—in bright orange and green colors similar to the signs of the Sunshine ticket of Governor Carl Gutierrez. Geri was Gutier- rez’ wife, and she was running for governor a full fourteen months ahead of the primary election. Mrs. Gutierrez had never run for public office, so the media and ordinary citizens tended to view her candidacy as a bold effort by the governor to have his wife elected in 2002 (he could not run for a third consecutive term) and in effect keep him in power until he could run again in 2006.</p>
                <p>The year 2000 also saw the last nail driven into the coffin of Guam’s quest for a new political status other than commonwealth when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the state of Hawai‘i in Rice v. Cayetano. The court stated: “There is no room under the [Fifteenth] Amendment for the concept that the right to vote in a particular election [in the Hawai‘i case for the state Office of Hawaiian Af- fairs] can be allocated based on race.” Rice v. Ca- yetano thus set a precedent that may mean a Cha- morro-only vote on Guam, if challenged in federal courts, might be unconstitutional as a race-based vote, even though Chamorros may not constitute a “race” in GovGuam’s interpretation of UN criteria</p>
                <p>280</p>
                <p>for self-determination. With this legal bombshell, Guam’s Commission on Decolonization, the pur- pose of which was to set up an ethnic vote on politi- cal status, faded away. Political status would no lon- ger be an issue in Guam’s gubernatorial elections in 2002 and 2006 other than for rhetorical campaign purposes. Chamorro-rights advocate Angel Santos would die in July 2003, and Chamorro activism waned as more immediate issues of financial sur- vival preoccupied the hard-pressed people of Guam.</p>
                <p>The hard times got worse. In early 2000, the leg- islature imposed a GovGuam-wide salary freeze for three years, and the GovGuam retirement system continued to restrict COLA allotments despite legal challenges in the courts to release the funds due re- tirees by law. Along with all the local financial prob- lems, the people on Guam were shocked on Septem- ber 12, 2001 (one day ahead of the U.S. East Coast), to see on their televisions live images of airliners commandeered by terrorists crash first into the New York World Trade Center Towers, then into a Penn- sylvania field, and then into the Pentagon. In 2002 and 2003, many of Guam’s young men would find themselves in military uniforms and on their way to fight loyally again for the United States in distant wars, this time in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.</p>
                <p>The second term of the Gutierrez-Bordallo ad- ministration saw the worst troubles for the island since World War II. Guam’s economy continued to stagnate, the fiscal situation of GovGuam dete- riorated further, and the old problem of corruption among high officials recurred as if endemic to the colonial limbo in which the island still found itself. Major cases of corruption began erupting in the aftermath of Supertyphoon Paka when GovGuam officials were handing out contracts—in return for bribes—for recovery projects with FEMA money. In addition, a number of prominent politicians and physicians as well as GovGuam civil servants would be indicted over the next two years on vari- ous charges, including a spreading use of GovGuam credit cards (issued for official uses only) for unau- thorized personal expenditures such as entertain- ment. Many of the guilty constituted a front-page list of well-known people:</p>
                <p>CHAPTER 16</p>
                <p>A.J.(Sonny) Shelton, a former Democratic sena- tor and head of the Gutierrez-Bordallo finance committee in the 1998 election, was found guilty by a federal jury in September 2000 of rigging bids for Paka recovery projects.</p>
                <p>Gil Shinohara, Democrat and former chief of staff for Governor Gutierrez, was acquitted of gov- ernment corruption in one trial but in another trial was found guilty by a federal jury of a scheme to defraud the Bank of Guam and fed- eral lenders.</p>
                <p>Dr. Davina Lujan, former GMH administrator ap- pointed by Governor Gutierrez, pleaded guilty in November 2002 to distributing illegally the painkiller Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride, which is a prescription drug and addictive). It would later be revealed that Dr. Lujan secretly gave the drug to none other than Governor Gutierrez as well as others.</p>
                <p>James Sablan, Democrat and former president of the Guam Housing Corporation and chief of staff to Lt. Governor Madeleine Bordallo when indicted, pleaded guilty in federal court in Feb- ruary 2003 to money laundering.</p>
                <p>Marilyn Manibusan, a former Republican senator and a prominent Chamorro-rights activist, was found guilty in March 2003 on twenty-one federal counts of extortion, wire fraud, money laundering, and so on.</p>
                <p>Dr. Vivien Batoyon-Sagisi pleaded guilty in federal court in March 2003 to illegally distributing Percocet to Antonina M. (Toni) Palomo, for- mer special assistant to Governor Gutierrez.</p>
                <p>Tommy Tanaka, former Republican senator and candidate for governor, pleaded guilty in feder- al court in April 2003 to misprision of a felony (failure to stop or report a crime) in 1998 for rigging contracts with Gil Shinohara for a Paka recovery project.</p>
                <p>While these cases were being tried or investigated, the elections of 2002 were held. The adverse pub- licity about her husband’s administration eroded the already questionable chances of Geri Gutierrez, who ran with a political novice, retired army Major</p>
                <p>RECESSION 1990-2003</p>
                <p>General Benigno (Benny) Paulino, against the well- known Robert Underwood and Senator Tom Ada in the Democratic primary. Underwood had done a solid job for the previous ten years as Guam’s del- egate in Congress. He and Tom Ada easily beat the Geri Gutierrez—Paulino ticket. The single Repub- lican ticket brought together two prominent fam- ily names on Guam: Senator Felix Perez Camacho, son of Guam’s first elected governor, and Kaleo S. Moylan, son of Kurt S. Moylan, the lieutenant gov- ernor under Felix’ father.</p>
                <p>In the campaigning for the 2002 general elec- tion, the Underwood-Ada team failed to reconcile the major factions in the Democratic Party. These factions were the Gutierrez supporters (who largely supported Camacho-Moylan), the old Bordallo sup- porters (who still distrusted Carl Gutierrez), and the Chamorro-rights advocates led by Angel Santos</p>

                <p>and Underwood. As a result of all the scandals and the ongoing recession, the Camacho-Moylan ticket trounced Underwood-Ada by an 11 percent margin. The voters also elected the still-popular Madeleine Bordallo to the Washington delegate post over for- mer governor Joe Ada. In addition, the voters ap- proved new authorities in GovGuam in a reform ef- fort (which would turn out to be largely in vain) to depoliticize public utilities, education, and justice. In utilities, the people elected a new Public Utili- ties Commission whose main task was to try to sell to private companies the debt-ridden and poorly managed Guam Power Authority (GPA) and the similarly floundering Guam Water Authority. In education, the election created a new Guam Edu- cational Policy Board to serve as a watchdog over DOE appointed officials (DOE would be declared in a state of emergency in 2003 as funding ran out).</p>

                <p>The most interesting reform effort was the election in a four-way race for the first time of a Guam At- torney General who would be independent of the governor and the legislature. That winner was at- torney Douglas B. Moylan, cousin of Lt. Governor Kaleo Moylan, who would turn out to be a crusad- ing but controversial prosecutor.</p>
                <p>With information provided by the autonomous Guam Public Auditor’s Office (long and ably oc- cupied by Doris Flores Brooks), federal prosecu- tors, and the FBI, Moylan would bring to trial in Guam’s Superior Court over the next few years a dozen high officials of the two Gutierrez-Bordallo administrations, culminating in three criminal trials of Carl Gutierrez himself for using GovGuam funds and personnel in the construction of roads and util-</p>

                <p>This chronicle ends with three events that symbol- ize the underlying dialectic between overwhelm- ing external forces and resilient local endurance that characterizes much of Guam’s history. The first two events were natural disasters in 2002: Typhoon Chata‘an struck in July, causing much damage, and then another massive storm, Super- typhoon Pongsona, smashed the island on Decem- ber 8 with sustained 150 mile per hour winds and immense gusts that caused widespread destruction. The third event was the austere inauguration of</p>

                <p>Governor Felix Camacho and Lt. Governor Kaleo Moylan in January 2003 amidst the devastation left by the two storms.</p>
                <p>Pongsona destroyed approximately 3,000 homes. Fuel storage tanks at Apra Harbor exploded mas- sively, cutting off the gas supply for five days. Pong- sona was the most devastating of any storm since World War II despite the years of typhoon-proofing carried out in the concrete construction of buildings and infrastructure. Governor Camacho in his inau- gural address called for self-reliance and austerity by the island’s people, qualities they had shown so often in the past in the face of ongoing adversity imposed from without and abetted from within by governmental inadequacies.</p>
                <p>Washington again responded with FEMA and</p>
                <p>military assistance to the island, but the double battering Guam took from typhoons and the reces- sion brought the island in 2003 to its most fragile economic condition since 1945. Global warming, if valid, indicates even more powerful and frequent cy- clonic storms may strike the island in the future. At the same time, Guam will be even more at the mercy of external human forces as globalization of U.S. commerce and finances—and of wars—maintains the island’s geopolitical value to the United States while it also increases the island’s economic vulner- ability. The free trade policies pursued by Washing- ton in recent decades have had the unintended effect of damaging the economies of U.S. territories in the fishing, agricultural, and small retail sectors, mak- ing Guam ever more dependent on providing ser-</p>

                <p>vices to the unpredictable ups and downs of foreign tourism and to the American military presence. Therefore, the next decade or more may continue to be a time of troubles for the island. And yet, if the past is any measure for the future, Guam’s people</p>
                <p>285</p>
                <p>will respond courageously with steadfast resiliency to whatever the new century brings, whether it is nature’s fury, the self-serving hypocrisy of American government officials, or the inadequacies of their own local leaders.</p>
                <p>IRPULOGUE:</p>
                <p>Guam</p>
                <p>A Neocolonial Anachronism</p>
                <p>Guam is not a “basket case” MIRAB stereotype (MIRAB applies to small islands dependent on mi- gration, remittances, aid, and bureaucracy) as are many other partially decolonized Pacific islands, but it is close. What keeps Guam afloat is substan- tial tourism despite recession as well as military and other federal U.S. funding to a degree not available to MIRAB states such as the FSM or American Sa- moa. Guam’s economic viability is still dependent on its strategic location (as the closest part of the United States to Asia for tourism) and its enduring military value (the island remains the U.S. Gibral- tar of the western Pacific), as it was for Spain for two hundred years and as it is likely to remain for the United States for the indefinite future. In other words, Guam is a special case of colonialism that will go on for years in a postcolonial world unless Washington and the people of Guam reach a com- promise that meets the needs of both sides to end the colonial status of the island.</p>
                <p>That compromise should be met as both a moral imperative and as a practical necessity because—as this history demonstrates—colonialism fosters cul- tures of corruption. The imposition of alien values, whether in the name of religion, commerce, military necessity, or democracy, on other cultures is one of the most corrosive aspects of colonialism. This corrosion degrades not only the colonial subjects,</p>
                <p>286</p>
                <p>but also erodes the moral integrity of the colonial power. Such has been the case of United States rule on Guam.</p>
                <p>Colonialism under the United States has brought the people of Guam the highest material standard of living of any island in the western Pacific. Neverthe- less, a deepening moral corrosion was manifested in recent history by the failure to improve Guam’s political status and by the increasing frivolity of the island’s leaders. The most prominent examples of failure by the local leaders were Ricky Bordallo’s acceptance of bribes, Joe Ada’s adamant inflexibil- ity that doomed the quest for commonwealth, the extravagant self-indulgence of many of Guam’s sen- ators, and Carl Gutierrez’ questionable use of pub- lic money to improve his personal property.</p>
                <p>While this litany of laxity by Chamorro leaders was inflicted on their own people, the roots of mor- al erosion are fostered by the U.S. federal govern- ment, particularly the Interior Department with its reactionary and indifferent status quo supervision of Guam, and by the U.S. Congress, which has ne- glected to change antiquated U.S. territorial law that dates from the Insular Cases a century ago. As a re- sult, Guam remains in a state of torpor, a stagnant colonial coma that is a betrayal of America’s own ideals of liberty and full representative democracy.</p>
                <p>A salient example of U.S. neglect of its colonial</p>
                <p>EPILOGUE</p>
                <p>wards was the revelation in 2003 that back in 1975 the president of the United States, Gerald Ford, di- rected the Interior Department, through a team of Interior, State, and Defense representatives, “to seek agreement with Guamanian representatives on a commonwealth arrangement” and “to enhance the prospects for the ultimate integration of Guam with the Northern Marianas.” This presidential order was the outcome of the granting of commonwealth status to the Northern Mariana Islands and of a secret Guam study in 1973-1974 in which the De- fense Department, supported by the State Depart- ment, argued that Guam’s political status had to be addressed in order for the island to remain secure for U.S. military bases. The directive also stated the Congress “should be kept informed” since it would have to approve the negotiated agreement with Guam.</p>
                <p>Interior, although in charge of implementing the new policy, opposed it, just as it had opposed com- monwealth for the Northern Marianas. If imple- mented, the Guam directive could create precedents for other U.S. territories and reduce Interior’s juris- diction. In Washington’s bureaucracies, no agency cedes any of its fiefdom unless compelled to.</p>
                <p>As noted earlier, the Interior Department suc- ceeded in blocking the policy. Even more astound- ing in leak-prone Washington, no one apart from a few executive officials, and no one on Guam, would learn of the existence or substance of the policy for the next three decades. Interior officials led by Fred M. Zeder—a self-aggrandizing Texas businessman and Republican campaign donor—“embarked on a dilatory and indefensible deliberative process about how to deal with the presidential directive,” ac- cording to the authors of the book published in late 2004 that fully revealed the study. The most effec- tive tactic by Zeder to kill the policy was simply not to inform Guam’s leaders, members of Congress, or the media of the White House policy since it was classified “Secret.”</p>
                <p>A weak and preoccupied White House under Pres- ident Ford (President Nixon had just resigned over the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War was winding down to a U.S. defeat) allowed the Guam</p>
                <p>287</p>
                <p>process to slow to a snail’s pace by the time the Democrats under President Jimmy Carter took over the White House in 1978. The new White House did not revive the issue of Guam’s status because Carter reportedly wanted the recurringly contro- versial status of Puerto Rico settled first. Then the Shah of Iran was overthrown and Carter attempted an ill-fated rescue of U.S. Embassy personnel held prisoners in Tehran, leading to Carter’s defeat by Republican George H.W. Bush. With Washington preoccupied by these larger problems and with the status quo attitude of Republican leaders toward the territories, Interior officials quietly filed away their copies of the secret Guam study and Ford’s presidential directive, and the matter was forgotten or ignored for nearly thirty years.</p>
                <p>This sad tale of betrayal and neglect by the fed- eral government was revealed after two territorial experts—attorney Howard P. Willens and MARC Professor Dirk A. Ballendorf—requested in 2000 the declassification of the secret Guam study and Ford’s presidential directive under the Freedom of Information Act. After a two-year delay and a law- suit, the federal government released the material in 2003, and Willens and Ballendorf published it in their 2004 book, The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford’s 1975 Approval of Commonwealth Was Blocked by Federal Officials. This book shows that conspiracies among American public officials do exist and that agencies of the U.S. government still have great capacity for self-delusion and hy- pocrisy about their motives and actions, as the U.S. Navy had about Guam until 1950.</p>
                <p>The tragedy is that, for over twenty years after Ford’s directive, the leaders of Guam persistently continued their quest for a new political status that, unknown to them, had already been approved by a president of the United States. Guam wrote a con- stitution in the late 1970s that failed largely owing to the unresolved status issue, drafted a common- wealth act in the 1980s, and endured frustrating and eventually unsuccessful negotiations over it into the 1990s with a parade of U.S. officials themselves apparently unaware of the secret Guam study. The result was failure on both sides, and Guam remains</p>
                <p>288</p>
                <p>an anachronism in today’s postcolonial world, a century-old colony along with other U.S. island pos- sessions still under Interior’s possessive supervision.</p>
                <p>Much of the waste and ill-will engendered by Guam’s fruitless quest could have been reduced or perhaps avoided if President Ford’s directive had been carried out. That raises a question: could ne- gotiations be revived and commonwealth status still be attained by Guam and lead to reunification of the Marianas? At present that possibility seems un- likely. Revelation of how Guam was duped by the Interior Department infuriated many people on the island, who are likely to avoid resumption of execu- tive track negotiations with Interior’s involvement in the increasingly partisan politics of Washington. Guam’s first priority for the coming years is to get the island’s economy back on its feet. After econom- ic health is restored to the island, Guam will be in a stronger position to seek an end to its “state of involuntary colonialism,” as it is described by one Chamorro-rights advocate.</p>
                <p>Commonwealth status is also now more question- able for Guam in light of the sad state of the CNMI, which is mired in debt, corruption, and economic stagnation. New conditions in the world under glo- balization in a non-—nation state era may make it more feasible in the future for Guam and the Unit- ed States to consider statuses other than statehood (which remains unattainable without reunification of the Marianas) without jeopardizing U.S. defense goals. Globalization, with or without reunification of the Marianas, offers the prospect for Guam to turn even more toward Asia, notably China, for expanded tourism (as is occurring through the ca- sino on Tinian despite the CNMI recession) and for investments. Such a prospect would be enhanced if Guam, as a freely associated state, were freed of constrictions long imposed by the United States, such as the Jones Act and secret military and intel- ligence installations.</p>

                    <p>states under “subordinate sovereignty” with the United States has worked reasonably well to protect American interests while allowing the Micronesians self-determination without the artificial hindrances of U.S. laws such as the Jones Act. A salient ques- tion, however, is whether Guam’s people will be willing to give up American citizenship. Only the status quo or commonwealth that leads to state- hood in a reunited Marianas would maintain U.S. citizenship.</p>
                    <p>A more distant possibility is that the United States could do away with the old doctrine of the Insular Cases and make all its island territories in- tegral parts of the union, if a majority of their citi- zens—regardless of ethnicity—so choose, without the territories becoming new states or remaining as colonies. In other words, why not design a new American self-governing entity that is neither a state nor a territory under the ever-flexible Constitution, which itself was created under the concept of public virtue in government to end colonialism.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the future may bring, it is clear from the history recounted in this book that the political sta- tus of Guam should be changed for the greater ben- efit of both the United States and the island’s peo- ple. Furthermore, a change in Guam’s status should be carried out, and can be carried out, in a way that protects the heritage and rights of the indigenous Chamorro people on their own island. Colonies in the twenty-first century, regardless of geopolitical considerations, are unnecessary leftovers of a by- gone imperial age. They are embarrassments and hindrances to the progress of the American people. The United States should be leading in the removal of such historical anachronisms—not perpetuat- ing them—so that Guam can once more be what it was to the ancient people of the Pacific, the free taotao tasi who first came upon the island, a bright beckoning landfall with a blue shore of promise in earth’s great ocean of life.</p>

                <p>Insider versus outsider accounts of history: For the view that the contro- versy is a “simplistic duality” that serves political purposes, see Munro (1994).</p>
                <p>Modes of historical analysis: For the view that historical accounts should be audience-oriented, see Daws (2006).</p>
                <p>Prologue</p>
                <p>Magellan: His birth name in Portuguese was Fernao de Magalhaes, and in some Spanish documents he was called Fernando de Magallanes. See Lévesque (1992, 1:131-304).</p>
                <p>Guam’s size and location: See Karolle (1999). Guam’s area of 214 square miles includes several small near-shore islands, notably Cocos Island off the southwestern shore. The area of Guam alone is 212 sq.</p>
                <p>miles. The exact location of the northernmost tip of Guam at Ritidian Point is 13° 39’ 2” N latitude and 144° 51’ 6” E longitude.</p>
                <p>Micronesia as a region: Some cultural anthropologists state, “Micro- nesia does not exist.” Strathern et al. (2002). This may be true from cultural and genetic viewpoints since the area is so diverse. However, Micronesia is a distinct political region and has been so since the mid- nineteenth-century Spanish period in terms of partial or complete for- eign control despite the fragmentation of the area in the late twentieth century into three freely associated states (Palau, the FSM, and the Mar- shalls) under shared sovereignties with the United States, and two U.S. territories (Guam and the CNMI) that are still, in effect, U.S. colonies.</p>
                <p>Oceania: Some scholars make a distinction between “Remote Ocea- nia” (mainly Micronesia and Polynesia), to the east of the Andesite</p>

                <p>Line (a geographic division within Oceania east of which no andesite lava or continental rocks occur), and “Near Oceania” (mostly in Mela- nesia) based mostly on biogeographical differences. See Green (1991, 493-495).</p>
                <p>Kotzebue quote: Kotzebue (1967b, 3:92).</p>
                <p>Survival of indigenous Chamorro identity: See Boutilier et al. (1984). For view that islanders were primarily innocent victims of colonialism, see the Hale‘ ta (Our Roots in Chamorro) series of books published in the 1990s, subsidized by the Government of Guam through the Guam Economic Development Authority (GEDA) and the Political Status Co- ordinating Commission and produced by the Chamorro Heritage Insti- tute under the direction of Dr. Katherine Aguon for use as textbooks in Guam’s public schools.</p>
                <p>Magellan’s voyage: See Pigafetta (1969); Lévesque (1992, 1:231-248); and Wallis (1954). Lévesque (1992-2002) provides in twenty volumes the most comprehensive documentation in the original languages with English translations and analyses of European explorations in Microne- sia from 1521 to 1819.</p>
                <p>Chapter 1: Aliens 1521-1638</p>
                <p>Magellan’s sighting of Rota and Guam: See Rogers and Ballendorf (1989) and the account in Blair and Robertson (1903-1909, 1:196- 197), where Ginés de Mafra, a pilot on the Trinidad, describes the sighting. Magellan was lame from a wound received fighting Moors in North Africa.</p>
                <p>Albo’s log: See Albo (1971); Lévesque (1992, 1:221-229) (Lévesque, who spells Albo as Alvo, also provides translations and analyses of Pi- gafetta and the Genoese pilot on the Guam landfall); Navarette (1971, 340). A fake “diary” of Magellan was printed in the Guam Recorder, Vol. 3, No. 10, January 1927, 265-267, but there are no known ac- counts by Magellan of his Pacific voyage.</p>
                <p>Pigafetta’s quote on proas: See Pigafetta (1969). The original manu- script by Pigafetta was in Italian with some dialogue in Spanish; it was being edited for the pope when it disappeared in the sack of Rome in 1527 by—of all people—Spanish soldiers.</p>
                <p>Derivation of “Chamorro”: Driver (1985, 5); see also Plaza (1971). A log by pilot Esteban Rodriguez with Legazpi in 1565 translated chamurre as “friend”; English translation in Lévesque (1992, 2:91). In 1602, Juan Pobre used the word chamuri as the indigenous term for hombre principale in Spanish, meaning a headman, not a chief. In the 1990s, indigenous rights activists on Guam began to use ”Chamoru” in place of “Chamorro,” and in 1994 the Chamorro Language Com- mission of Guam adopted “Chamoru” in place of “Chamorro” in the indigenous language. “Chamorro” remains standard in English.</p>

                <p>Goam, and so on, as early names of Guam: Driver (1985, 6, 9, 42). The 1545 Portuguese map showed the southernmost island as Guahan (see note above for p. 11). Purchas (1905, 198) quoted the chief pilot of Dutch ships under Oliver van Noort as stating in 1600, “The Island was called Guana.” The name could have derived from the Chamorro phrase guaha hanom, “a place where there is water.”</p>

Wild breadfruit with seeds is dukduk (also spelled dugdug or dokdok) in Chamorro (Artocarpus mariannenesis).</p>
                <p>Introduction of plants: Guzman-Rivas (1960, 118) states that the Span- iards introduced 115 tropical American plant species into Guam. There was also transmittal from other directions; an example is, in Chamorro, the alangilang tree (Cananga odorata) from the Philippines and called ilangilang in Tagalog. This tree’s flowers emit a sweet-smelling perfume in the evening. The official flower of Guam is Bougainvillea spectabilis (nobiu in Chamorro), introduced from Melanesia.</p>

Pigafetta (1969, 85-86) mentions the practice in the Philippines, as does Morga (1971, 278).</p>
                <p>Syphilis introduced: Yaws appears to have been the only treponemal disease (bejel, yaws, and syphilis) present in the Marianas prior to Span- ish contact. Syphilis (which originated in the Caribbean) was already present in Europe and the New World among Spanish military before 1521 and was likely spread to the Pacific from the galleons after Le- gazpi’s conquest of the Philippines, beginning in 1565. See Heathcote (1995).</p>

Anthropologist Knudson (in Hunter- Anderson (1990, 127) concluded that precontact Chamorros were or- ganized only into “estate groups” and villages under headmen.</p>

                <p>Chapter 3: Father San Vitores 1662-1672</p>
                <p>San Vitores’ first visit to the Ladrones in 1662: Garcia (1683, 10, 11); the day and exact island are not reported. Garcia’s history, based on original Jesuit letters and reports from the missions, is the main source for later works on San Vitores, including Andrés de Ledesma (1672), Morales (1737), Le Gobien (1700), Murillo Velarde (1749), Castro (1723), Colin and Pastells (1904), Risco (1935, 1970), Juan Ledesma (1981), Diaz (1992), and Lévesque (1994, Vol. 4; 1995, Vol. 5). The early accounts are largely hagiographic to glorify religious aspects of San Vitores’ life. Some writers spell San Vitores as Sanvitores. Description of San Vitores: Garcia (1683, 159); Murillo Velarde (1749, nn. 724-731).</p>
                <p>No mission in the Ladrones: Blair and Robinson (1903-1909, 9:226); Colin and Pastells (1900-1902, Vol. 1, n. 178); Beardsley (1964, 123). The earliest request for a mission was in 1596. See Hezel (1970, 1982). Esteban Dias (or Diaz) of the Concepcion: Risco (1970, 195); Garcia (1683, 152); Ledesma (1981, 429), and Lévesque (1995, 4:392; 5:406, 427). Burrus (1954, 936) quotes a San Vitores letter that Esteban was a “Tagalan,” while other accounts call him a Visayan.</p>
                <p>Early life of San Vitores: Garcia (1683, 4-6); Ledesma (1981, 27-132). See Risco (1970) for popularized hagiographic account.</p>

                <p>San Diego to Peru: Higgins’ note in Garcia (1683, 26) quotes San Vi- tores’ friend Brother Lorenzo Bustillo as saying that the ship rolled over on its side at Cavite when the order to go to Peru was given but mi- raculously rolled back up once the order was rescinded. This was one of numerous miracles that Garcia and other Catholic writers describe as occurring during San Vitores’ life and after his death because of his religious devotion.</p>

                <p>Quipuha: Spanish and Jesuit accounts variously used the spellings Qui- puha and Kipuja. In the 1980s to 1990s, Chamorro-rights activists Chamorrized the name ex post facto variously to Kipuha and Kepuha.</p>

In 1998, the name was changed to Calungsod (a Filipino version) by the Bishop of Cebu, Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, in the cause to have Calonsor beatified by the Catholic Church. Calonsor was beatified as Pedro Calungsod in 2000.</p>
                <p>Use of term Marianos: Higgins’ translation often used Chamorros, but Garcia’s Spanish text of 1683 used Marianos, indios, or nativos.</p>
                <p>Pueblo de los Martires: Garcia (1683, 54). San Vitores bestowed reli- gious place-names on every island, with Guam called San Juan, but no Spanish names survived except Asuncion for an island in the northern Marianas.</p>

                <p>Chamorro population in 1668: An issue of much debate. In 1602, Juan Pobre estimated “more than 60,000” on Guam and 12,000 on Rota,</p>

                <p>but he did not visit Guam. In his Papel de motivos of 1665, San Vitores estimated 20,000 on one unnamed island (presumably Guam) based on Admiral Esteban Ramos’ eyewitness estimate after the Concepcion wreck; Ledesma (1981, 268, 275). The Flemish Jesuit Peter Coomans on Guam wrote in 1673 that there were 12,000 Chamorros on Guam and 20,000 total in the Marianas; Lévesque (1996, 6:74—-86). In 1683, Garcia gave 50,000 on Guam based on San Vitores’ reports. Governor Pimentel, writing in 1709, estimated the population of all the Mari- anas was 24,000 in 1668. Demographer Underwood (1973) makes a conservative estimate of 30,000 on Guam in 1668, using all sources except Juan Pobre and Coomans. Hezel and Driver (1988) lowered the estimate to 20,000 to 30,000 for Guam and 50,000 to 70,000 for all the Marianas in 1668, using all sources except Coomans. The figures of 12,000 for Guam and 20,000 for all the Marianas by Coomans, backed approximately by Pimentel and based on firsthand observations, are probably the best estimates of the Chamorro population as of 1668.</p>

Brosses (1967, 2:498), writing in 1756, wrote that Le Gobien put words “in the mouth of” Hurao. Lévesque (1995, 6:11-14) states the Hurao speech quoted by Le Gobien is similar to a speech given later by Chamorro headman Aguarin and summarized by Garcia. Therefore it is likely Brosses is correct that Le Gobien expanded Garcia’s report of Aguarin’s speech and attributed it to Hurao. Nonetheless, the speech as Le Gobien quoted it was used</p>

Le Gobien appears to have based his “quote” of Hurao’s speech on Garcia’s account of Aguarin’s speech. Neither Gar- cia nor Le Gobien was ever on Guam. Lévesque (1995, 6:11-14) states the Hurao/Aguarin speech was never reported in primary sources such as letters and reports from Jesuits on Guam. See note above for p. 49.</p>

It became the patroness of the dotacién com- pany and was placed in a niche or small tabernacle (camarin in Spanish) behind the altar in the Agana presidio barracks chapel constructed in 1736, but it was moved to the cathedral in 1884 after Governor Pazos’ assassination.</p>

                <p>Size of Guam: As of 1990, the Guam Bureau of Planning uses a figure of 135,680 acres, or 212 square miles, which does not include coastal islets. Karolle (1999) uses 136,960 acres, or 214 square miles (55,427 hectares), which include Cocos and all other coastal islets. Karolle’s fig- ure is used in this history.

                <p>OPI-R and Chamorro views on political status goals: These views were articulated during the 1980 and 1990s by Guam’s intellectuals. See Robert Underwood (1987 and his numerous speeches and articles); Souder-Jaffery and Underwood (1987); Michael Perez (1997); and Viv- ian Dames (2000).</p>
                <p>Chamorros-only vote: Some Chamorro activists argued that Guam should seek rights similar to some Native American tribal governments on reservations where federal U.S. law is limited, but the Indians re- tain full U.S. citizenship and some have received compensation for land taken by the U.S. government in accord with the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), and the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. 1601-1627 (Supp. V 1975); Leibowitz (1989, 433-434).</p>
                <p>Mutual consent in Guam commonwealth act: In 1997 Madeleine Bor- dallo, the widow of Governor Ricardo Bordallo and by then the Lt. Governor of Guam, stated (quoted by Dr. Wyttenbach-Santos, [1998, 148-149 in n. 1 to p. 1]) that mutual consent was always one of Gover- nor Bordallo’s nonnegotiable cornerstones for commonwealth. That is not the understanding of the author of this book, who had many discus- sions with Bordallo on commonwealth in 1982-1986. In those discus- sions, Bordallo was realistic and knew Guam would have to be flexible on what would be accepted by Congress. He only accepted mutual con- sent as a bedrock demand after Guam’s Republican leaders threatened in 1986 to block approval of the draft if mutual consent and other hard demands were not included. It is the author’s opinion that had Ricky Bordallo not been indicted and had he been reelected in 1986, he would have negotiated changes in the commonwealth act (including a more realistic provision on mutual consent along the lines of the precedent in the CNMI Covenant) with greater flexibility than his successor, Joe Ada, and that as a result Bordallo might well have attained common- wealth status for Guam.</p>

By the mid-2000s retirees were owed over $188 million in delinquent COLA allowances based on infla- tion. Retirees were paid a flat rate averaging about $1,800 annually in- stead of a rate based on their retirement checks as required by law. This inflicted hardship on many retirees. In late 2006, the Superior Court ordered the back allowances to be paid. As of the date this book was written, such owed allowances have begun to be paid. See PDN, 30 November 2006, 5.</p>

                <p>Declassification and release of The Guam Secret Study: Dr. Richard H.J. Wyttenbach-Santos, a UOG professor and former naval officer who served on the Zeder interagency Guam group in the 1970s, first publicly referred to President Ford’s policy on Guam’s commonwealth in papers Wyttenbach-Santos presented at annual UOG Public Adminis- tration Conferences on Guam in 1993 and 1995. Since the Guam study was still classified, he did not elaborate, and the matter was not ques- tioned. Not until full declassification in 2003 did officials and observ- ers on Guam realize the significance of the study and the policy. See Wyttenbach-Santos (1993, 162), and (1995, 3).</p>

                <p>The orthography of the indigenous Chamorro language of the Mariana Islands has been changed several times. The Cha- morro-English Dictionary by Donald M. Topping, Pedro M. Ogo, and Bernadita C. Dungca (1975) followed principles adopted by the Marianas Orthography Committee in 1971. Those principles and that dictionary are used in this book as the standard reference for spelling Chamorro words. In 1983, a new system of spelling was adopted by the Chamor- ro Language Commission of Guam, but a new dictionary with that orthography had not been published as of 2006. As a result and as noted throughout this book, there are variations in the spelling of many Chamorro words. In 1994, the commission changed the spelling of the word “Chamorro” to “Chamoru” in the indigenous language on Guam, but</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="1">
                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>project supported in great measure by a generous grant from the Northern Marianas
                    Humanities Council, along with matching funds from the Northern Marianas
                    College (NMC). The book is a collection of essays, articles, and narratives that ex-
                    plores some of the many topics relevant to contemporary life in the Marianas.</p>

                <p>As we embarked on this project, we had two primary goals. One was to meaningfully
                    contribute to the intellectual and cultural mosaic of the Marianas. The other was
                    to do so in a comprehensive fashion. To accomplish the former, we reviewed the
                    existing literature on the region to establish what gaps we might help to fill. While
                    substantial literature on the Marianas exists, and seems to increase in volume every
                    year, much of this literature does not utilize an academic or scholarly approach.
                    Consequently, while this collection is not exclusively a scholarly endeavor, a signif-
                    icant number of the contributions are scholarly in form and approach. Moreover,
                    existing literature that does examine aspects of contemporary life in the Marianas
                    often suffers from a lack of accessibility, whether sequestered behind publisher pay-
                    walls or accessible only in physical archives. In compiling these works, we sought to
                    make a broad collection of writings on the Marianas available—in one accessible
                    place— to the people of the Marianas and beyond.</p>

                <p>Any investigation of human life for a locale or set of peoples is invariably under-
                    pinned by an investigation of culture. Exploration of the existing literature on culture
                    and related subjects in the Marianas was instructive in helping us ascertain what
                    space this book might occupy. In addition to the usual internet databases, directo-
                    ries, indexes, and search engines, two valuable resources were the Pacific Collection
                    and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Archives, both
                    housed at the Northern Marianas College. These resources offered a wealth of local
                    literature, much of which are primary sources or texts unavailable in digital format.</p>

                <p>Also invaluable were the digital catalogs of the Micronesian Area Research Center
                    (MARC), housed at the University of Guam (UOG), and the peer-reviewed journal
                    Pacific Asia Inquiry, a UOG publication. The former provided information on or access
                    to locally produced or locally relevant scholarship, such as unpublished theses, that
                    were often difficult to find via other digital platforms. The latter helped us better
                    appreciate the scope of Micronesia-specific cultural scholarship produced in the
                    past decade. These resources, among others, confirmed to us that while there was
                    considerable literature about the Marianas, and considerable academic scholarship
                    on the region, there was not nearly enough scholarly literature examining local life
                    and culture to reflect the diversity and vitality teeming in the islands today. Notable
                    examples of existing scholarship include such works as The New Shape of Old Island
                    Cultures: A Half Century of Social Change in Micronesia and Making Sense of Micronesia:
                    The Logic of Pacific Island Culture, both by Francis X. Hezel (2001 andamp; 2013); Tiempon I
                    Manmofo'na: Ancient Chamorro Culture and History of the Northern Mariana Islands by
                    Scott C. Russell (1998); Cultures of Commemoration: The Politics of War, Memory and
                    History in the Mariana Islands by Keith L. Camacho (2011); and Saipan: The Ethnology
                    of a War-Devastated Island by Alexander Spoehr (1954).</p>

                <p>This selection of books, as well as many other similar titles, highlights two key gaps
                    in the scholarly literature on life and culture in the Marianas. One shortcoming is
                    that much of what literature does exist often subsumes the Marianas in the broader
                    regional scope of Micronesia, and in some cases the wider Pacific (e.g., Liston et al.
                    [2011]; Pacific Island Heritage: Archeology, Identity andamp; Community; Farzana Gounder's
                    [2015] Narrative and Identity Construction in the Pacific Islands; or Strathern et al.'s
                    [2002] Oceania: An Introduction to the Cultures and Identities of Pacific Islanders). To be
                    sure, a great many commonalities exists amongst the people of the various islands
                    of Micronesia, and to a lesser extent the wider Pacific Islands or Oceania region,
                    yet these commonalities are likely dwarfed by the unique dynamics at play in
                    each of the constituent entities. For example, in a move that only took full effect
                    in 1986, the CNMI freely entered into a political union with the United States as
                    a commonwealth, a circumstance that distinguishes it from fellow territories and
                    other nations in the Pacific (as well as US territories elsewhere). Guam, meanwhile,
                    serves as the home for some of the largest US military installations in the Pacific,
                    and allows non-indigenous ownership of land, both circumstances that distinguish
                    it from many Oceanic nations. The dynamics in these examples have been at play
                    for decades, yet continue to exert a profound impact on the people and life in the
                    respective islands today.</p>

                <p>Another issue highlighted in those texts is the historical focus of much of the schol-
                    arship produced about the region. Humans, according to current research, have
                    inhabited the Marianas for over 3,500 years. The islands have also been impacted
                    by Western colonialism for much of the past 400 years, and played a vital role in the
                    Pacific theater of World War II. As a consequence, the region has been of great in-
                    terest to historians and archeologists from around the world. And yet, even though
                    the Marianas has now collectively spent several decades under the auspices of the
                    United States, recent scholarship on the region continues to reflect an imbalance
                    between the historical and the contemporary. As such, the bulk of the existing
                    Marianas-related scholarship examines aspects of life that far predate the present.</p>

                <p>Despite its relatively small land mass and population, the Mariana Islands can
                    claim several compelling reasons (beyond their intriguing history) to document life
                    today. As previously mentioned, the islands have a unique territorial relationship
                    to the United States, a relationship all the more unique given the remote location
                    of the archipelago. This remote location is also of particular strategic importance
                    as the United States continues to engage the burgeoning regional power of China.
                    Because of its current relationship with the United States, as well as the globalizing</p>
                    
                <p>effects of such developments as the internet and cheap international travel, indig-
                    enous Marianas cultures—already themselves greatly altered by hundreds of years
                    of colonialism—are undergoing significant and rapid shifts. Moreover, given the
                    geopolitical dynamics of the past century in the region, the Marianas has one of the
                    most ethnically and culturally diverse populaces on the planet, a feat all the more
                    notable when considered in the context of the relatively small size of the islands and
                    a total population of less than 250,000 people across the archipelago. For these and
                    other reasons, we found it imperative to try to capture in some measure a scholarly
                    picture of present-day dynamics in the region.</p>

                <p>To be fair, the literature on the region goes far beyond the aforementioned texts, and
                    far beyond scholarly or academic books in general. To a degree, the wider collection
                    of literature on life in the Marianas also suffers similar issues of scope (frequently
                    historical), but given the diversity it also provides more examples of contemporary
                    dynamics in the region. As we developed this project, we relied on and were inspired
                    by the work of such academics and writers as Laura Souder, Samuel F. McPhetres,
                    Vicente M. Diaz, Robert A. Underwood, Don Farrell, David Atienza de Frutos,
                    Michael L. Bevacqua, Mavis Warner Van Peenen, Bo Flood, and many others (some
                    of whose work appears in this volume) to guide us. This body of literature is com-
                    prised of both scholarly and creative work, but together it helps to highlight another
                    gap in the scholarly literature this volume aims to address: accessibility.</p>

                <p>Over the lifespan of this project, we were pleased to see, year after year, ever more
                    contemporary scholarship produced on aspects of life in the Marianas. Much of this
                    scholarship was produced locally, or by sons and daughters of the Marianas who
                    live, work, and study elsewhere in the world. A significant portion of this scholarship
                    comes in the form of academic work done in pursuit of master's and doctoral degrees,
                    in particular the theses that are a requirement for completion. These theses, while
                    valuable contributions to the scholarship, often go unpublished. Sometimes copies
                    will be procured by local institutions (such as the UOG's MARC or the CNMI Pacific
                    Collection at NMC) or made available online, but apart from those avenues, access-
                    ing that literature is difficult, all the more so for non-researchers or non-academics.</p>

                <p>Other limits on accessibility exist as well. Much of the scholarship on the region,
                    even relatively recent scholarship, is unavailable in digital format. Often it can only
                    be found in print versions, usually in the library collections of UOG or NMC. The
                    same goes for much primary source material of a cultural nature. Typically, it has
                    not been digitized, and frequently it is only accessible in person at one or two in-
                    stitutions in the region. Likewise, more recent scholarship that has been published
                    digitally often can only be found behind paywalls. All of these circumstances con-
                    firm two prevailing issues regarding cultural scholarship on the region. First, the
                    scholarship is often difficult to access for academics (and often next to impossible
                    for non-academics), and second, and perhaps more importantly, the academic liter-
                    ature on the region, while expansive and burgeoning, is often disparate and diffuse
                    in nature. It is these limitations, as well as the aforementioned gaps in the contem-
                    porary cultural scholarship on the region, that this book hopes to help redress.</p>

                <p>To say that this book is merely a scholarly or academic one, however, would be in-
                    accurate. While we place an emphasis on the academic and see one of the primary
                    purposes of this endeavor to help fill certain gaps in the scholarship on the region,
                    the text is rounded out with more creative works. These creative works include
                    narratives and poetry, which further help to illuminate life in the Marianas today.
                    The inclusion of these creative works is a means to help us accomplish the other
                    principal objective of this text.</p>

                <p>The other primary goal for this text was to provide a measure of comprehensiveness
                    as it addressed the subject of life in the Marianas today. One aspect of this goal was
                    to seek a broad scope of topics and issues within the relatively narrow geographic
                    focus. Our hope was to reflect the diverse nature of life through the varied pieces
                    in the book. Given life's complexities, this is necessarily an endless pursuit, but
                    we sought to at least attempt it through an approach that advanced a panoramic
                    perspective comprised of multiple, micro-focused investigations. Among the more
                    than 20 contributions to this volume, none explore the same topic. Connections and
                    thematic threads exist, but each piece explores in its own unique way a particular
                    facet of life in the Marianas today. In this way we hoped to offer an expansive—if still
                    incomplete—picture of life in the region.</p>

                <p>Another aspect of the comprehensive approach is an effort to reflect and pay homage
                    to the diversity and collective spirit of the region. Fundamentally, this meant ensur-
                    ing that voices from the different populous islands of the chain be heard. Given the</p>

                <p>diversity present in the region, we also thought it imperative to gather voices of or
                    from as many groups and communities as possible. Thus, the book contains works
                    from academics, writers, educators, and other professionals. The contributors hail
                    from communities and embody characteristics too disparate to enumerate here,
                    though a notable feature is that women have authored a majority of the works in-
                    cluded. As we mentioned earlier, in addition to diverse subject matter, each author
                    approaches her topic in her own way and with her own voice. Some use a narrative
                    style, others a scholarly one. Others still take a blended approach, or one that seems
                    to use an observational or commentary style. And yet, despite differences in form
                    and subject matter, each work enlightens us to life in the Marianas as it is today—a
                    panorama via the micro-focused. In this way, this volume seeks to piece together
                    disparate elements into a contemporary mosaic of the Marianas.</p>

                <p>While diversity is a notable feature of the region, and consequently an intellectually
                    honest examination of the region should acknowledge and document that charac-
                    teristic, such an approach nevertheless has its perils. Though the region has been
                    impacted—often brutally and adversely—by 400 years of colonialism, militarism,
                    and other hegemonic attitudes and policies, it must be recognized that indigenous
                    populations have persevered in the face of these conditions. Those populations
                    persevere to this day. The chief peril, then, in taking an approach that highlights
                    the diversity of the region, is to abet, as Kenneth Gofigan Kuper argues elsewhere
                    in this volume, the marginalization of indigenous voices under the guise of mul-
                    ticulturalism. To allow this would be a mistake. To combat it, this book seeks a
                    balance between indigenous and non-indigenous voices that befits the cultural
                    landscape of the region.</p>

                <p>In addition to the goal of contributing to the literature of and on the region, and
                    doing so in a comprehensive way, we had one final guiding principle in the develop-
                    ment of this book, one that pertained to the audience. Our hope as editors was that
                    we might not simply create literature about the Marianas but also for the Marianas.
                    In particular, we hoped that this book would be available to anyone who wished to
                    read about life in the Marianas today. As such, care was taken to render the writing
                    in an accessible fashion, so that this book—composed of diverse content written by
                    diverse authors—could be read and appreciated by a diverse audience beyond the
                    traditional scope of academe.</p>

                <p>As we examined the contributions to be included in this volume, several themes
                    emerged. Many of the pieces spoke to matters of place. Others dealt with matters
                    of person. Others still explored politics. Some addressed a combination of topics.
                    Beyond these themes of person, place, and politics, we found others to be more
                    salient as a guide to arranging this text. The works in this book fall into two gener-
                    al thematic categories: those that document or otherwise examine what we'll call
                    “signs” of life or cultural dynamics in the region, and those that identify or other-
                    wise analyze the “shifts” underway in the region. The former category helps detail
                    the social, political, and cultural world the people of the Marianas inhabit today.
                    The latter seeks to clarify how we have arrived at this particular world with this par-
                    ticular set of dynamics, some of the effects of these dynamics and the longer-term
                    historical factors, such as colonialism, that shaped them, and how that world con-
                    tinues to change. Indigenous and non-indigenous voices help to establish both the
                    “signs” and “shifts” chronicled here. In some cases, particularly the pieces of a more
                    narrative bent, the signs or shifts manifest on a more personal note. In others, the
                    signs or shifts help us appreciate the dynamics taking place at a broader level.</p>

                <p>We should say that the demarcation between “signs” and “shifts” is neither exact nor
                    absolute. Each piece is complex, delving into context, circumstance, and causality.
                    Invariably, each piece reveals elements of both sign and shift, given the intertwined
                    nature of the two ideas. Yet most of the pieces seemed to fall to one side of the divide
                    or the other. We hope this structure helps readers appreciate both the conditions and
                    the consequences of life in the Marianas today.</p>

                <p>Signs
                    In Chapter 1, Mary Therese Perez Hattori offers a framework for authentic and
                    culturally sustaining leadership that could benefit both CHamoru heritage individ-
                    uals and the American institutions in which they work. The framework harnesses
                    CHamoru cultural precepts to facilitate authentic leadership in academic institu-
                    tions while maintaining cultural heritage, and thereby proposing an alternative to
                    Western models and ideals of leadership—models and ideals often at odds with
                    CHamoru and other Indigenous cultures.</p>

                <p>In the next chapter, Ajani Burrell chronicles the recent explosion of local clothing
                    brands in the region, with a particular focus on the CNMI, and explores to what
                    degree this explosion is a manifestation of cultural pride. He finds that the dynamics
                    of the local clothing market are complex and suggests several contributing factors
                    for the exceptional popularity of these types of brands.</p>

                <p>Chapter 3, by Anne Perez Hattori, analyzes how recent novels set in the Marianas
                    represent—and sometimes misrepresent—the people, habitat, and culture of the
                    region. The essay also assesses the historical veracity of the novels, and posits that
                    the histories represented in these novels are not always fair or ethical with respect to
                    the culture they purport to depict.</p>

                <p>Royce Camacho explores the notion of mamåhlao in CHamoru culture in Chapter
                    4. Drawing upon thinkers from Plato to Foucault, and punctuated by local anecdotes
                    and illustrations, Camacho examines manifestations and implications of mamåhlao
                    in the classroom and in the tourism-driven gift shop, among other settings.</p>

                <p>In Chapter 5, Gerard van Gils recounts an anecdote from his first year teaching high
                    school in Saipan, and uses that experience to explore some vital cultural and social
                    issues that create challenges not just for the education system, but for most insti-
                    tutions in the region.</p>

                <p>Tabitha Caser Espina examines identity formation for third-generation Filipinos in
                    Guam in Chapter 6. She takes a multidisciplinary approach that employs autoeth-
                    nography and the analysis of poems written by two Guamanian poets. Espina utilizes
                    the popular Filipino dessert halo-halo as a metaphor to underpin her assessment
                    that this generation of Filipino immigrants in Guam undergoes a significant degree
                    of “mixing” as they negotiate their identity formation.</p>

                <p>In a series of poems that comprise Chapter 7, Craig Santos Perez explores themes of
                    Chamorro culture, food, politics, migration, family, ecology, and history.</p>

                <p>In Chapter 8, Sharleen Santos-Bamba and Tabitha Espina investigate how
                    Chamorrita and Filipina women use literacy in different ways as they develop their
                    identities. The research takes an intergenerational and intercultural approach to
                    better understand how each of these populations forms its identity and relation-
                    ships to one another.</p>

                <p>Chapter 9, by Mary Therese Perez Hattori, discusses how the author has come to
                    thrive as a CHamoru transplant in Hawai‘i. In relating her journey, she uses her expe-
                    riences, scholarly and cultural work, and research to provide strategies for CHamoru
                    transplants to stay connected to their culture and maintain their cultural identity.</p>

                <p>In Chapter 10, Angelyn Labadan explores the reasons behind the notable lack of
                    arts resources and programming in the CNMI, as well as public perspectives on the
                    value of art in the community.</p>

                <p>Chapter 11, by Poonsri Algaier, paints a picture of contemporary life for the Thais
                    who remain in Saipan from the large influx of immigrants during the boom years of
                    the garment industry.</p>

                <p>In Chapter 12, Lisa Linda S. Natividad examines family violence in the Marianas and
                    offers a framework that includes historical trauma and traditional CHamoru con-
                    cepts of the family system to better understand the deeper dimensions of this issue.
                    She also discusses some of the implications for social service practitioners, with the
                    goal of developing more effective and culturally appropriate intervention practices.</p>

                <p><strong>Shifts</strong><br/>
                    In Chapter 13, Kenneth Gofigan Kuper provides a segue from Signs to Shifts through
                    an exploration of multiculturalism in present-day Guåhan. Kuper posits that multi-
                    culturalism is just the latest manifestation of settler colonialism designed to deprive
                    Indigenous CHamorus of agency and independence in their homeland. As part of
                    his analysis, Kuper chronicles key aspects of the colonial history of Guåhan and
                    examines the role of a pivotal court case in reinforcing the more negative impacts of
                    multiculturalism on the island.</p>

                <p>In the next chapter, Dominique B. Hess examines ongoing language change in the
                    largest and most populous island of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
                    Islands, in particular the influence of the English language on the local community
                    and languages. Her research highlights the tensions that underpin the shifting lan-
                    guage landscape in Saipan, and notes the emergence of a distinct, local variety of
                    English that reflects these tensions.</p>

                <p>Chapter 15, by Victoria-Lola M. Leon Guerrero, recounts the heart-rending story of
                    trying to process the loss of her first child shortly after his birth. In reckoning with
                    her grief, she experiences a spiritual transformation born out of a conflict between
                    her Indigenous culture and her Catholic upbringing.</p>

                <p>Tricia Lizama explores the current state of traditional healing in the Marianas in
                    Chapter 16. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with more than 40 traditional
                    healers in the region, this essay contours the worldview of the Mariana Islands healer.
                    Lizama also chronicles developments in 21st century traditional healing, and in so
                    doing, provides a glimpse of what the future of this millennia-old practice may hold.</p>

                <p>In Chapter 17, Sylvia C. Frain examines the way in which CHamoru and Refaluwasch
                    women are spearheading the resistance to militarization in the Marianas region.
                    The article presents three distinct examples of these efforts and highlights critical
                    factors that that help foster and propagate the resistance.</p>

                <p>Chapter 18, by Ajani Burrell, examines a particular and perplexing change in
                    neighborly dynamics in Rota. Interviews with Rota residents, along with historical
                    and demographic information, help to inform a narrative that explores the
                    phenomenon of Rota residents becoming increasingly unlikely to ask small favors
                    of their neighbors. The essay also discusses some possible causes of this change, as
                    perceived by residents themselves.</p>

                <p>Theresa “Isa” Arriola argues in Chapter 19 that the people of the CNMI should re-
                    consider how they conceptualize sovereignty. At the heart of this reconsideration is
                    the role and interpretation of the CNMI Covenant. She advances the idea that con-
                    ceptions of sovereignty in the CNMI should be rooted in Indigenous epistemologies
                    rather than Western ones, which could result in a more fluid and effective sovereign-
                    ty for the people, one that resists future militarization and opens the door to a more
                    expansive interpretation of the CNMI's political status.</p>

                <p>In the next chapter, Cinta Matagolai Kaipat investigates notions of respeto (respect)
                    in Refaluwasch (Carolinian) culture and how it has changed over the past three gen-
                    erations. As a bedrock of Refaluwasch culture, respeto influences or impacts many
                    other aspects of the culture, several of which are discussed here in this wide-ranging
                    examination. Kaipat asserts that the erosion of respeto over the past three genera-
                    tions has been swift and precipitous, with dire consequences for the culture —both
                    present and future—should the decline not be remedied.</p>

                <p>Chapter 21, by Malcolm Johnson, highlights the changes affecting the Talakhaya
                    watershed in Rota. He reports on several aspects of his time in Rota while working
                    as a National Coral Reef Management Fellow, including the shifting human rela-
                    tionships to the watershed, local perspectives on the watershed and programs to
                    help sustain it, and the challenges—human and environmental—facing this vital
                    feature of Rota's ecology.</p>

                <p>To conclude, Kelly G. Marsh-Taitano, in Chapter 22, explores the dynamics that have
                    produced the multiethnic and multicultural island that is Guåhan today. As part of
                    this exploration, Marsh highlights recent demographic shifts, as well as some of the
                    impacts these shifts are having on life and people in Guåhan.</p>

                <head>CHamoru Leadership Lessons (Mary Therese Perez Hattori)</head>
                <p>Born and raised on Guam, I am one of nine children of Fermina Leon Guerrero
                    Perez and Paul Mitsuo Hattori. I moved to O‘ahu after I graduated from high school
                    in 1983 to further my education at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM). I
                    completed a baccalaureate degree in Secondary Social Studies with a concentra-
                    tion in Pacific Islands History, a Professional Diploma in Secondary Social Studies,
                    a master's degree in Educational Technology, and a Doctor of Education degree in
                    Professional Educational Practice.</p>

                <p>While in college, I took several jobs at UHM, progressing from positions as a student
                    employee during my undergraduate studies, to professional positions as a computer
                    specialist, academic advisor, lecturer, and professor in the fields of computer sci-
                    ence, information technology, educational technology, and teacher education. For
                    over 10 years, I was Technology Director at Kapi‘olani Community College, the
                    largest community college in the University of Hawai‘i system, and currently I serve
                    as Interim Director of the Pacific Islands Development Program.</p>

                <p>Crosscurrents of Culture
                    Early in my career, I struggled with being a teacher and leader, trapped in the
                    crosscurrents of two cultures—CHamoru and American. My teacher training and
                    leadership development programs promoted American principles and practices that
                    often ran counter to my Native cultural ideals. Individualism, ambition, competi-
                    tion, and rapid decision-making were valued over communal identity, collaboration,
                    and deliberate, tradition-honoring decision-making. An individual's accumulation
                    of material wealth and increased social status were key factors in academic and
                    career planning; colleges even supply students and parents with charts showing
                    the highest paying college majors and lifetime salary-earning potential based on
                    college degrees. Students are encouraged to select majors as soon as possible, while
                    exploring a variety of disciplines is strongly discouraged with institutional policies
                    such as the practice of placing students on academic warning if they do not declare
                    an academic major by the time they are sophomores. Education is not viewed as a
                    developmental process that may take time, but a means to rapid degree completion
                    and lucrative employment.</p>

                <p>In the initial phase of my career, I engaged in teaching educators a curriculum based
                    on American principles, all the while ignoring ways that a program of study may con-
                    tradict my own Indigenous ways, beliefs, and standards. I also participated in several
                    leadership development programs that were grounded in ideals and customs of US
                    society. These programs promoted a variety of Western leadership models such as
                    Breakthrough Leadership, Sustainable Leadership, and Adaptive Leadership, and
                    provided examples from American institutions such as the military, for-profit corpo-
                    rations, and politics. There was no acknowledgement of culture, which is a critical
                    aspect of leadership, as noted by Chamorro-Premuzic and Sanger (2016).</p>

                <p>Although the core ingredients of leadership are universal (good judgment,
                    integrity, and people skills), the full recipe for successful leadership requires cul-
                    ture-specific condiments. The main reason for this is that cultures differ in their
                    implicit theories of leadership, the lay beliefs about the qualities that individuals
                    need to display to be considered leaders.</p>

                <p>For a time, I was caught in opposing cultural crosscurrents and believed that as a
                    CHamoru living in the United States, survival and success would depend on the abil-
                    ity to set aside my own culture and live up to expectations of the dominant American
                    society. Faculty in institutions of higher education in the state of Hawai‘i are largely
                    judged by individual effort; tenure and promotion in many fields requires publica-
                    tion of articles or books authored as an individual, not as a co-author. There are no
                    mechanisms to support team-teaching by hiring more than one faculty member to
                    teach a course. Documents submitted for contract renewal, tenure, and promotion
                    must be written in a self-centered and I-focused style that highlights one's individual
                    accomplishments. People like me who come from societies that value humility and
                    a communal identity are advised to use “I” and “me” rather than “us” and “we,” and
                    are instructed to remove all self-effacing and modest language from our documents
                    because those may be viewed negatively by peer and administrative reviewers. In
                    one promotion application, I ignored this advice and crafted statements that reflect-
                    ed my unit's collective identity, including the statement, “Many of my professional
                    accomplishments are the result of helping others make connections to the infor-
                    mation, resources, decision-makers, and skills they need to realize their objectives
                    and contribute to the achievement of organizational goals.” This approach was not
                    well-received, and one reviewer complained that he could not distinguish my identi-
                    ty and my achievements from the identity and achievements of the department I led.
                    In my view as a leader of one of the largest units on the campus, the development
                    of a communal identity was a positive achievement, and as a good leader my pro-
                    fessional successes were possible because of the group's efforts and support. I was
                    directed to provide a supplemental statement reframing my leadership philosophy
                    and accomplishments from an individual perspective. This was a wholly inauthen-
                    tic document but a requirement to move my promotion application forward, so I
                    complied with this request. This is but one example of cultural expectations of the
                    dominant society being imposed on my professional life and producing a living
                    contradiction in which my values were denied in my workplace (McNiff, 2013, p. 35).
                    These conflicts motivated me to find ways to validate and legitimate my CHamoru
                    culture in leadership. To be authentic and to honor my heritage, I used Western
                    models such as Robert Greenleaf's Servant Leadership and Authentic Leadership
                    as conceptual bridges, stepping-stones to understanding that allowed my American
                    colleagues and superiors to see and understand the value of a culture-based lead-
                    ership praxis. With these Western-based constructs of Servant Leadership and</p>
                    
                <p>Authentic Leadership, I was able to navigate antagonistic crosscurrents and articu-
                    late those CHamoru approaches which make me a better leader. These approaches
                    can be helpful models for others; our Native ways and wisdom can also be used to
                    mitigate problems of American culture and colonization.</p>

                <p>Riding the Currents: Culturally Sustaining Leadership
                    The work of educator Django Paris provides another way for me to advocate for
                    cultural authenticity in American schools and workplaces. Paris (2012) asserts that
                    our schools can “support young people in sustaining the cultural and linguistic
                    competence of their communities while simultaneously offering access to dominant
                    cultural competence” (p. 95). In other words, culturally sustaining education enables
                    students to retain and sustain their cultures while learning the skills needed to suc-
                    ceed in the dominant culture. Paris and Alim (2014) state, “equity and access can best
                    be achieved by centering pedagogies on the heritage and contemporary practices of
                    students and communities of color” (p. 87).</p>

                <p>Culturally sustaining leadership means leveraging the best parts of my CHamoru
                    identity and culture in enacting an effective leadership practice and permitting
                    those I lead to honor their heritages while succeeding in their respective jobs. Even
                    in the midst of foreign institutions we can use aspects of our culture to be effective
                    leaders wherever we are, at home or away.</p>

                <p>Authentically CHamoru Leadership
                    As stated earlier, literature on the topic of authenticity in leadership was an im-
                    portant conceptual bridge allowing for CHamoru ways to be integrated into my
                    professional practice. Avolio and Gardner (2005) suggest that authentic leadership
                    is a foundational or root construct which “forms the basis for what then constitutes
                    other forms of positive leadership” (p. 328). Authenticity is required of leaders; in
                    fact, “Leadership calls us to be authentic: to be true to ourselves and be true to
                    the world” (Terry, 1993, p. 189). CHamoru culture thus forms the foundation of my
                    leadership philosophy and guides my decisions and conduct. Terry (1993) writes,
                    “Authenticity informs and directs action; action grounds authenticity in life. …
                    Without authenticity, action drifts. Without action, authenticity remains idle con-
                    jecture and wishful thinking” (p. 138). In this essay I highlight two cultural elements
                    that I have integrated into my leadership praxis. This act of articulation is also an act of authentic leadership; leaders must identify and share their values with their
                    followers (Aponte-Moreno, 2014).</p>

                <p>Belonging
                    As CHamorus, we practice and prioritize belonging; it is a notable aspect of our cul-
                    ture that can have a transformational impact on organizational culture. Like many
                    people of the Pacific, CHamorus are oriented toward a communal identity which
                    gives everyone a sense of recognition and belonging. Belonging, as described by
                    Spiller and Wolfgramm (2015) “embraces spiritual ideals of interconnectedness and
                    relationality” (p. 305). A primary lesson I learned throughout my childhood was that
                    everyone is a valued member of the family and the greater society simply by virtue
                    of being born and that nothing I did or did not do could eradicate my status as a
                    CHamoru. A strong sense of security comes from being born into a state of belong-
                    ing and it is “a defining source of happiness and is central to well-being, meaning,
                    and purpose” (Spiller andamp; Wolfgramm, 2015, p. 303). We do have high standards and
                    aspirations for our children and ourselves, but achievements such as material
                    wealth or social status are not measures of worth and acceptance.</p>

                <p>Members of cultures that are individualistic rather than communal often struggle
                    for recognition and belonging. It is a source of great concern noted by Swiss philos-
                    opher de Botton (2005), who says “it is an almost universal anxiety: an anxiety about
                    what others think of us; about whether we're judged a success or a failure, a winner
                    or a loser” (p. vii).</p>

                <p>The famous medical doctor Oliver Sacks was impressed by this ethos of belong-
                    ing after having visited Guam while investigating the disease Lytico-Bodig. In an
                    interview with TV Ontario's Allan Gregg (2010), Dr. Sacks spoke of an “immensely
                    different and moving sense of belonging” and contrasted CHamoru and American
                    responses to disease:</p>

                <p>One of the horrors of disease in American communities, especially with those
                    who have severe degenerative diseases, is that one gets isolated, abandoned,
                    stigmatized, marginalized and falls out of the world. On Guam, I never saw that.
                    People would remain completely part of the family and community, a full person
                    right to the last. If they had to go to the hospital, the whole family would go with</p>

                <p>them. The hospital was like a village. Everyone is integrated all the while, even
                    before Lytico-Bodig. In this way, they are much more civilized than we are.</p>

                <p>These social problems mentioned by de Botton and Sacks are caused by a lack of and
                    struggle for recognition and belonging and are uncommon in our islands, which
                    have a strong spirit of belonging. Perhaps this CHamoru tradition is an antidote for
                    these social woes (Hattori, 2016).</p>

                <p>Educational researchers note a connection between academic success and a sense of
                    belonging in school. They note, “Feeling part of a school or classroom community
                    has significant psychological benefits for students and makes them more likely to
                    engage in productive academic behaviors” (Farrington et al., 2012, p. 28). An example
                    of putting belonging into practice is to infuse program orientation with the CHamoru
                    ethos of belonging. I tell students in orientation programs that by virtue of admis-
                    sion, they belong. In a highly selective educational leadership doctoral program at
                    UH, I remind new students, many in positions of leadership and all over-achievers,
                    that they need not worry about proving themselves; instead, they should focus their
                    efforts on improving themselves. Former students have remarked that these assur-
                    ances of belonging were among the most affirming moments in their orientation and
                    for some, gave them a new sense of freedom they do not necessarily have in their
                    professional lives. As an educator, I felt responsible for creating a sense of belonging
                    in the classroom and relational accountability to my students. This requires estab-
                    lishing a relationship with the students to the greatest extent possible given limited
                    class time and office hours. I fostered belonging through team-building, collaborative
                    learning pedagogies, and engendering in students a sense of responsibility for the
                    learning of others. This awareness of doing good for the benefit of others or the ben-
                    efit of the whole is typical of CHamoru culture where older siblings nurture younger
                    siblings, where youth are taught to be mindful of the needs of elders.</p>

                <p>These benefits of a culture of belonging apply to the workplace as well as schools;
                    employee engagement has been linked to a sense of belonging. This can be achieved
                    by a leadership that affirms each employee's suitability for the unit, prioritizing a
                    communal identity, and engendering collaboration rather than competition. In the
                    workplace, I fostered a communal identity at several levels by organizing employees
                    into functional teams, creating project teams that include people from across dif-
                    ferent functional teams, and by ensuring regular team and departmental meetings.</p>

                <p>The meetings had several purposes for each functional team: to inform others of
                    their work, to recognize and acknowledge achievements of individuals and teams,
                    and to maintain awareness of departmental and organizational goals. Employees
                    develop professional identities as members of a functional team and as members
                    of the department as a whole. The word “we” was used more often than “I” or “me,”
                    and as the unit head, I always reported the department's achievements as collective
                    accomplishments. These team and department meetings were a commitment to
                    fostering relationships among professionals who might not work directly with each
                    other on a regular basis, and generated a sense of collective identity and account-
                    ability. As the head of the unit, I was not only accountable to the institution, but was
                    also able to use the collective identity to impart a relational accountability to my
                    employees. As an educator and leader, I have seen the ideal of belonging transform
                    and empower students and employees.</p>

                <p>Cultural Metaphors
                    Like many Indigenous people, CHamorus communicate using analogy and met-
                    aphor, which are powerful tools for educators and leaders. Philosopher Ortega y
                    Gasset (2019) says, “The metaphor is probably the most fertile power possessed by
                    man” (p. 33). We gain and transmit knowledge through analogy and metaphor. On
                    metaphors as a leadership tool, Terry (1993) writes, they “open paths for understand-
                    ing human discourse” (p. 68). Metaphors “open windows onto reality” (p. 160). Our
                    culture is replete with powerful metaphors that illuminate CHamoru ways of being;
                    here I share two that can be applied to leadership—latte and wayfinding.</p>

                <p>The latte—stone house-posts used in ancient CHamoru society—is an important
                    cultural icon and can be a metaphor for strength, support, foundations, and the
                    strength borne of unification. The latte is created through the combination of haligi
                    house-post and tåsa capstone; latte standing in groups can form strong structural
                    foundations. Leaders use this iconic image to inspire unity, connection, and relation-
                    al accountability. I have employed this metaphor in several instances, sometimes
                    sharing the chant, “Ini Na Latte” by Leonard Iriarte as a call for unity. I have shared
                    it in speeches to Pacific Islanders in Hawai‘i and on the mainland in programs such
                    as the National Pacific American Leadership Institute (NAPALI), a leadership de-
                    velopment program hosted annually in Hawai‘i for emerging Indigenous leaders,</p>

                <p>and the City College of San Francisco's Talanoa program, which hosts public events
                    bringing those of Pacific Islander heritage in San Francisco together for periodic
                    talks by noted Pacific Islanders. Another commonly used metaphorical device
                    comes from the revival of the traditional canoe sailing, which inspires the use of
                    navigation as a metaphor. We often talk about navigating successfully in school,
                    in college, in the workplace, and life. Goals and vision can be communicated as
                    important destinations. Leaders, mentors, parents, and friends can be described
                    as celestial bodies that provide guidance, or as winds, tides, and currents helping
                    others reach their destinations.</p>

                <p>Communicating organizational goals through metaphor is an effective leadership
                    skill. Terry (1993) notes a connection between leadership, metaphors, and authenticity:
                    “Leadership calls us to be authentic: to be true to ourselves and be true to
                    the world. In order to be true to ourselves, we must look at any misalignment that
                    exists between our professed metaphor and the behavior that is entailed by
                    that metaphor.” (p. 189)</p>

                <p>Closing Reflection
                    An authentic professional life, grounded in culturally sustaining practices such as
                    belonging and the use of metaphor, and other cultural elements not addressed here
                    such as chenchule', respect for manåmko', and temporal intelligence, has made me
                    a more successful leader and educator (Hattori, 2016). Beyond my own profession-
                    al growth, sharing and modeling culturally sustaining leadership in professional
                    development workshops enable me to contribute to change in the people and in-
                    stitutions I serve. There is recognition of the worth of our Indigenous knowledge
                    applied to organizational culture. The Native cultures of the Mariana Islands are
                    rich in positive customs and values that can benefit others and make this world a
                    better place. Let's identify, articulate, and practice the best elements of our culture
                    and share them, enriching ourselves and everyone else in the process.</p>

                <p>Culturally sustaining leadership brings to mind an account of the Greek myth of
                    Narcissus in a novel by Coelho (1993). In the legend, the young man is so enraptured
                    by his reflection in a lake that he cannot look away, falls into the water, and drowns.</p>

                <p>When Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found that the
                    lake, which had been fresh water, was transformed into a lake of salty tears. “Why
                    do you weep?” the goddesses asked. “I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied. “Ah,
                    it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for though we always
                    pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.”
                    “But … was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked. “Who better than you to know
                    that?” the goddesses said in wonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt
                    each day to contemplate himself!” The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it
                    said, “I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep
                    because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes,
                    my own beauty reflected” (p. ix).</p>

                <p>Culturally sustaining leadership provides ways leaders can give their followers this
                    kind of experience—so that in our workplaces, our activities, and in our personal
                    encounters, they see reflections of their own beauty.</p>

                <head>Repping the Marianas: Cultural Pride and the Rise of Mariana Islands-Inspired Clothing Brands (Ajani Burrell)</head>
                <p>In 2017, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or CNMI, had an
                    estimated 52,000 inhabitants (Central Intelligence Agency, 2018). The CNMI is an
                    archipelago of fourteen islands stretching across hundreds of miles in the northwest
                    Pacific Ocean, but the population largely resides on three islands: Saipan, Tinian,
                    and Rota. These three islands are marked by diverse geography that includes ele-
                    vated limestone plateaus, valleys, cliffs, rocky and sandy beaches of various sizes,
                    and large swaths of thick jungle, but cover in total just 116 square miles. This total
                    land area is about one-fifth the size of O‘ahu, and about one-tenth the size of
                    Rhode Island, the smallest of the United States, while the CNMI's population is just
                    one-twentieth that of Rhode Island.</p>

                <p>Though the area and population density are relatively small, the CNMI holds an
                    abundance of beautiful beaches and natural scenery. Over half a million tourists
                    flock annually to the islands (Marianas Visitors Authority, 2018), which are home to
                    a variety of cultures and communities, including at least eight different Pacific Island</p>

                <p>groups and people from more than half a dozen Asian countries (US Census Bureau,
                    2011). The CNMI also has something else in abundance: local clothing brands. In
                    2018, the people of the CNMI could choose from more than 20 local clothing brands,
                    an astounding number for a population of only 52,000 people. Even more astound-
                    ing is that of these twenty-plus brands, no fewer than 13 of them are located in or
                    were founded in the CNMI.</p>

                <p>To put this situation into context, imagine the town of La Crosse, WI (estimated 2017
                    population: 51,834) or Palm Desert, CA (52, 932), or Valdosta, GA (56,085) (US Census
                    Bureau, 2017). Imagine if thirteen different companies were producing and selling
                    distinct La Crosse-related clothing and accessories in La Crosse (or Palm Desert or
                    Valdosta). Try to imagine visiting a place where half the population is wearing an
                    article of clothing that depicts or represents some aspect of the local culture. How
                    many people on a given day in La Crosse, WI, are wearing clothing that represents
                    La Crosse or its culture? Even iconic and populous cities such as New York or Los
                    Angeles do not see such rates. The only location that seems even remotely analo-
                    gous would be a college campus, where a significant portion of the student body on
                    any given day is wearing clothing associated with the institution. Such is the perva-
                    sive nature of the local clothing brand movement in the Marianas.</p>

                <p>What are local clothing brands? For the purposes of this chapter, local clothing
                    brands (LCBs) are those that produce and sell clothing and accessories that relate
                    directly to the Marianas region, which includes both the CNMI and Guam, a neigh-
                    boring US territory to the south. These LCBs are designed by people who live in
                    or come from the Marianas region. More importantly, the designs for these brands
                    represent some aspect of life or culture in the region, and are all marketed to people
                    who live in the region or come from the region.</p>

                <p>While a plethora of LCBs exists today, only two or three such brands existed as recent-
                    ly as 2005, barely 15 years ago. Then a veritable explosion of LCBs occurred around
                    2015, when entrepreneurs launched or rebooted some of the largest CNMI-based
                    brands still in existence today. For Marianas residents then, the growth was obvious.
                    It seemed—and still seems—that at least half the population at any given moment
                    is wearing a product from one of these brands. Why have these brands—and their
                    popularity—proliferated so quickly? And what can this growth tell us about the
                    people and the culture of the Mariana Islands today?</p>

                <p>Clothing, in particular dress and fashion, is a public display of culture, values,
                    and identity. In recent decades, scholars from a multitude of academic disciplines
                    —including philosophy, economics, geography, cultural studies, and sociology,
                    among others—have contributed to the interdisciplinary study of fashion (Aspers
                    andamp; Godart, 2013, p. 175). Crane and Bovone (2006) posited that fashion can serve
                    as an example of the connection between symbolic values and material culture,
                    and that “material goods express values; consumption of these goods is a means
                    for the consumer to communicate messages about the values she holds” (p. 320).
                    The study of clothing as a value-laden material good has a long history, dating back
                    to the 1930s, according to Hsu and Burns (2012), who built on the work of Allport,
                    Vernon, and Linday (1951, 1960). Hsu and Burns—following earlier writers Blackwell,
                    Miniard, and Engel (2001), Hofestede (1994), and Lapitsky (1961), among others—put
                    this value formation in a cultural context, asserting that values, including cultural
                    values, “are learned and can shape our consumer behavior, which includes clothing
                    selection” (pp. 1585–1587). Since culture shapes clothing choices and clothing choices
                    can thereby reflect values, an examination of the clothing or fashion choices of a
                    culture can potentially reveal some of the values at work in a culture.</p>

                <p>Similarly, clothing as a means to understand and examine identity (both personal and
                    cultural) has been well documented. Giddens (1991) asserted that “dress is vastly more
                    than simply a means of bodily protection: it is, manifestly, a means of symbolic display,
                    a way of giving external form to narratives of self-identity” (p. 62). Crane and Bovone
                    (2006), following earlier work by Giddens (1991), Goffman (1961), Bovone (2003), and
                    others, have argued that the wide variety of fashion choice in today's society imparts a
                    sense of agency to the individual, and can be viewed as the individual making a choice
                    for a particular, meaningful self-identification (p. 323). Crane (2000) posited that
                    “clothing choices provide an excellent field for studying how people interpret a spe-
                    cific form of culture for their own purposes” (p. 1). Other scholars have also examined
                    the connection between identity and personal values (Hitlin andamp; Piliavin, 2004, p. 382).</p>

                <p>History of Marianas Dress
                    As with many other aspects of life in the Marianas, clothing and dress can be viewed
                    within the historical dynamics of three major eras: pre-European contact, colonial
                    occupation, and the post-colonial period. Reports from the first European contact,
                    Magellan's 1521 visit, and from the ensuing decades indicate that the Indigenous
                    Chamorros were scantily clothed. Flores (2010) stated that men generally went with-
                    out clothing, while “most observers noted women wearing at minimum a leaf (tifi')
                    attached to a cord around their waists, or a piece of paper-thin bark (gunut), which
                    covered their private parts” (p. 508). Flores also cited reports describing regular use
                    of natural accessories from both land and sea as adornment, body modification, or
                    indication of social status.</p>

                <p>Indigenous dress began to shift radically in the late 17th century when Spain es-
                    tablished colonial occupation, and religious missionaries came to the islands. In
                    and around Hagåtña, the present capital of Guam and former headquarters for
                    the Spanish colonial administration, the Indigenous Chamorros—including men,
                    women, and children—adopted Spanish clothing, although outside of the capital,
                    “where contact with religious authority was limited, indigenous attire was still worn”
                    (Flores, 2010, p. 508). Although the influence of the Spanish Empire weakened over
                    the 18th and 19th centuries, a Spanish style of dress persisted in the form of the
                    mestisa, which generally consisted of woven fabric pants and shirts for men and
                    a kamisola and skirt for women (Flores, 2010, p. 509). George Fritz (2001) reported
                    similar attire for Chamorros in the Northern Mariana Islands under the German
                    administration in the early 20th century. Men's work attire consisted of “short pants
                    (katsunes) reaching to the knee and a short shirt (chinia) worn over the pants,” while
                    women wore a “skirt (lupes) … a short blouse (chinina) and a kerchief (paniou-ulo)”
                    (p. 35). However, the Refaluwasch (Carolinians who had settled in Saipan in the
                    early 1800s) resisted the adoption of Spanish-style clothing well into the 20th century.
                    Refaluwasch men wore “a piece of cotton cloth tied between their legs” and women
                    wore a similar cloth, only wider and wrapped around their hips (Craddock, 1982).
                    Outside influences, including from the Japanese, who administered the Northern
                    Mariana Islands between WWI and WWII, would continue to affect dress styles
                    through the 20th century, though Flores (2010) noted that the style throughout the
                    archipelago remained largely “consistent despite political changes between the
                    Northern Mariana Islands and Guam” (p. 510).</p>

                <p>Americanization during the post-WWII period marked another shift in dress styles,
                    with American styles predominating. More recently, dress styles in the Mariana
                    Islands have been impacted by the globalization of the clothing and textile indus-
                    try, with a wide variety of brands available for purchase. In the late 20th century,
                    a “renaissance of Chamorro language and culture began” that, in part, resulted in
                    an “interest in redefining Chamorro identity via the use of ‘heritage' items” (Flores,
                    2010, p. 510). This fusion of American influence and renewed interest in Chamorro
                    identity provides the historical context for an examination of the eventual rise of
                    local clothing brands, the focus of this research.</p>

                <p>Local Clothing Brands and Cultural Pride in the Marianas
                    To explore the scope and background of local clothing brands of the Marianas, I
                    interviewed brand principals and conducted a survey of the Northern Marianas
                    College community. I also analyzed the symbols, taglines, mottos, and motifs of the
                    brands to better understand brand goals, as well as the specific cultural signifiers
                    they employ or embody.</p>

                <p>Until the turn of the 21st century, people in the Marianas were largely limited to
                    clothing designed and produced outside the region. The lifestyle of the islands drew
                    people to surfing brands such as Quicksilver and Hollister, as well as global compa-
                    nies such as Nike. Sporadically, local entrepreneurs would produce a limited run of
                    t-shirts. Often these shirts would be emblazoned with images of Chamorro warriors
                    or sayings. By most accounts, the local clothing brand movement has its origins at
                    the beginning of the 21st century, with the founding of Fotten Gäga' in the CNMI
                    and Fökai Industries in Guam. According to their respective Facebook pages, Fotten
                    Gäga' was founded in 2001, while Fökai Industries opened its first store in 2003. Both
                    brands are still in operation today and retain their early popularity. Around 2005,
                    the first big wave of local clothing brands began, and over the next few years more
                    brands were launched, including Rocksteady (Magas/Mas Magas, 670, Deepside,
                    Stressfree), Chokechain, Atdit, Poksu, Marianas Built, and Salbahe'. A second wave
                    of brands launched around 2015, including Trendsetters, Legends, Roil Soil, and,
                    perhaps the most popular CNMI brand today, Tribe Marianas.</p>

                <p>Since 2005 or so, more than two dozen local clothing brands have launched in the
                    Marianas, with many setting up shop in the CNMI. One goal shared among nearly
                    all these brands is a desire to positively represent the people, culture, and region to
                    the world. A common theme in interviews with owners and designers of some of
                    the best-known local brands was their concern over the general lack of knowledge
                    about the Marianas and her people in the wider world, particularly the mainland
                    United States. Often, Islanders find that when they visit the United States, few
                    people have heard of the Marianas or know much about a region that comprises two
                    US territories and boasts some of the highest rates in the country of enlistment in
                    the US armed forces (Hicks, 2014; Weare andamp; Cruz, 2017). Misperceptions are common,
                    and people from the mainland may wonder whether people in the Mariana Islands
                    wear grass skirts, or whether they have McDonald's and the Internet. Consequently,
                    according to Tribe Marianas co-founder Rob Travilla (personal communication,
                    May 8, 2017), “one of the major—if not first—missions of Tribe Marianas, is to spread
                    the Marianas worldwide, so hopefully one day we no longer need to introduce our-
                    selves.” Many brands express a similar sentiment in their online descriptions. Fökai,
                    one of the largest brands in the Marianas, describes itself as “an imminent venture
                    to present the native people of the Mariana Islands to the world as an intelligent,
                    persevering, and respectful and respectable community” (Fokai Industries, n.d.a),
                    while the Rocksteady shop was founded “in an attempt to promote and represent the
                    culture, people and life of the Marianas” (irocksteady, n.d.a). Eric Palacios (personal
                    communication, December 4, 2017), creator of the Atdit and Trendsetters brands,
                    agrees, and believes that the “common goal” for all of the brands in the Mariana
                    Islands is to represent the islands.</p>

                <p>Symbols, Taglines, and Motifs
                    Brands achieve the goal of representing the people and culture of the Marianas
                    in distinct ways, but they all share a concerted effort to infuse aspects of the local
                    culture into each brand. For most, this starts with the company or brand name.
                    Some have chosen to incorporate explicit references to the region, such as Tribe
                    Marianas, 670 (the telephone area code for the CNMI), MarianasBuilt, Chamorrita
                    Swimwear (Chamorrita refers to young Chamorro women; it is also the name of
                    an ancient song style in the Marianas), Hafaloha (“Hafa” is the first word of the
                    Chamorro greeting “Hafa Adai”), and Hafa Brand. Others chose a specific word or
                    phrase from Chamorro (e.g., Fökai, Poksu, Fotten Gäga', Magas, Atdit) that references
                    key concepts of local culture—strength, perseverance, leadership, or being calm
                    in adversity.</p>

                <p>The same dedication to representing the Marianas people and culture is also evident
                    in brand taglines and logos, as well as the symbols and images that appear in the de-
                    signs. The tagline for Tribe Marianas, for example, is “Divided By Tide x United By
                    Pride,” a reference to the demography and geography of the region, the fact that a
                    significant portion of the Indigenous people from Guam and the CNMI now reside
                    in the US mainland, and the shared cultural pride of people from the Marianas.
                    Other taglines from Tribe Marianas include “Common Tradition, Common Culture,
                    Commonwealth,” in reference to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
                    Islands, and “XV Deep,” referring to the 15 islands of the Marianas chain and their
                    proximity to the Marianas Trench, the deepest place on earth. Other brands echo
                    this cultural sentiment. Roil Soil's motto is “Rep Your Soil,” which, according to lead
                    designer Peter Aldan (personal communication, January 25, 2018), means to “repre-
                    sent your homeland and culture, to have pride” in the Marianas as a place of origin.
                    A motto for Crowns Guam reads, “Our Waters Run Deep. Our Roots Run Deeper.”</p>

                <p>While taglines and mottos often express geographical or cultural pride elements,
                    the logos of the companies usually depict cultural heritage artifacts. Perhaps the
                    most common symbol is the latte stone, which figures prominently in the history
                    and culture of the islands; it appears at the center of the official CNMI seal. The
                    Tribe Marianas logo includes two crossed adzes, a carving tool of the ancient
                    Chamorros. Some logos, such as those of Roil Soil and Fotten Gäga', feature native
                    plants, while others include iconic symbols of the culture, such as spears or bows
                    and arrows. The products displayed on the websites of the various brands illustrate
                    many of the popular aspects of Marianas culture and history, from marine activities
                    like surfing, outrigger paddling, and spearfishing, to local flora and fauna. Cultural
                    expressions frequently reference indigenous Chamorro or Carolinian words, local
                    place names, or historical nicknames for the islands. Cultural symbols often depict
                    heritage items or icons, including latte stones, slings, local canoes, flora, and so forth.</p>

                <p>Influences: Producers and Consumers
                    While examination of the brands and their products reveals an abundant use of cul-
                    tural, geographic, and geopolitical features of the region, interviews with the brand
                    principals reveal that such thematic foci are conscious choices tailored to a local
                    population. As Pete Aldan (personal communication, January 25, 2018) said about
                    the design influences for Roil Soil, “we try to incorporate the mindset of the islander,
                    one who practices patience and enjoys the simpler things in life. There is definitely
                    a connection between us and our natural environment. The Chamorros and
                    Carolinian (Refaluwasch) can be defined by the islands—interconnected, small, yet
                    diverse and beautiful.” This sentiment applies not only to Indigenous descendants,
                    but to just about anyone who calls the Marianas home. When asked who the
                    customers of Tribe Marianas are, co-founder Rob Travilla (personal communication,
                    May 8, 2017) said, “When you define the word tribe it's basically a group of people
                    with common interests or common tradition or common culture … and I feel like even
                    if you've only lived on Saipan for a week but if you say, ‘man I love the beaches, I love
                    the culture, I love the food,' it automatically connects you to Saipan, and wearing
                    a Tribe Marianas shirt makes you feel like you will always be a part of the tribe.”</p>

                <p>In my interviews with brand principals, they affirmed their strong bond with their
                    home in the Mariana Islands, and their conviction that their customer base shares
                    that affinity. That local loyalty seems in part to be driving the popularity of the brands.</p>

                <p>Whatever the reason for their popularity, the broad appeal of the local brands is
                    apparent. In addition to the anecdotal evidence gathered from interviews with
                    owners and designers of the brands—mostly boutique brands with intimate cus-
                    tomer relationships—I conducted a survey in December 2017 of consumers of LCBs
                    in the Marianas. Among the 154 respondents from the Northern Marianas College
                    community, nearly 4 out of 5 (78.3%) indicated that they purchased or wore products
                    from one or more LCBs. Of those respondents, 76% indicated that they purchased or
                    wore products from at least two LCBs, which equates to 60% of all respondents. All
                    these figures help to confirm the popularity of LCBs in the Marianas.</p>

                <p>While the respondents were predominantly aged 18-24 (63.4%), and therefore not
                    representative of the general population, affirmative response rates were relatively
                    consistent across the three largest age groups represented in the survey (18-24, 25-34,
                    and 35-44-year-olds). The survey data, coupled with anecdotal and observational
                    evidence from brand creators, reinforces the conclusion that these brands have
                    achieved notable penetration and popularity.</p>

                <p>Witnessing this explosion of locally branded and inspired clothing, as well as the per-
                    vasive use of culturally significant symbols and language by the brands themselves,
                    one might deduce that the popularity of the brands is an expression of cultural pride,
                    analogous to the cultural resurgence of local arts described by Flores (2010) and
                    other regional scholars. After centuries of colonial control by Spain, Japan, Germany,
                    and the United States, and decades under a formal territorial relationship with the
                    United States, the rise of LCBs in the Marianas signals a move to reclaim and reassert
                    cultural heritage. As Flores (2010) has noted, the cultural resurgence in the Marianas
                    began in the 1970s and has continued since then, invigorating various aspects of the
                    culture, from language and traditional practices such as maritime navigation and
                    healing, to environmentalism and political self-determination. The rise of LCBs,
                    from the late 1990s to the present day, has similarly manifested this cultural resur-
                    gence. Several respondents in the survey indicated that cultural pride was a motivating
                    factor in their choice of personal favorite brands or their pick of the most popular brand.</p>

                <p>Beyond Local Culture
                    The consumer surveys, and the statements by brand principals, also reveal that other
                    key factors besides cultural pride are likely at play. While both brand principals and
                    consumers recognized the role of cultural pride in the recent rise of LCBs, they also
                    pointed out that cultural pride is not a recent phenomenon of the Marianas. Eric
                    Palacios (personal communication, December 4, 2017) shared his belief that the “sense
                    of [cultural] pride” was always there in the people of the Marianas, whether living in
                    the islands or in the mainland. Shayne Villanueva (personal communication, March 5,
                    2018) concurred, stating that “Chamorro people are the proudest,” and part of the
                    success of Roil Soil and other brands is attributable to people always wanting to share
                    that pride. The great majority of survey respondents expressed a similar viewpoint.</p>

                <p>In short, cultural pride among Chamorro and Refaluwasch populations—along with
                    other long-term Marianas residents—is not a new development. Still, the LCB wave
                    of the late 2000s through the 2010s does represent a dramatic increase in the choice
                    and variety of local brand offerings. Ultimately, while cultural pride is likely an im-
                    portant driver, brand owners and consumers alike point to other dynamics, including
                    the rise of social media, the wider availability of low-cost printing and shipping, the
                    emergence of local entrepreneurial communities, the popularity of island hip-hop
                    music, rap, and streetwear, and possibly the influence of diaspora communities in
                    Hawai‘i and the US mainland. Taken together, all of these factors have contributed
                    to the prolific expansion of LCBs in the Marianas in the 21st century.</p>

                <p>Conclusion
                    The recent explosion of local clothing brands in the Marianas—and the range of
                    cultural signifiers that appear in their product lines—speaks to the enduring sense
                    of identity and pride in the Marianas. At the same time, interviews and surveys sug-
                    gest that broader commercial, cultural, and technological trends have also shaped
                    and encouraged the proliferation of these brands, from diaspora networks to the
                    global “streetwear” phenomenon, so that any analysis of the “rise” of LCBs in the
                    Marianas must note these external factors as well.</p>

                <p>Still, the concept of pride—whether for an indigenous or settler community, or for
                    residents living in the islands or living abroad—remains integral to the popularity of
                    these brands. Just as wearing a beloved sports team's clothing signals loyalty and
                    affinity, the ubiquity of local clothing in the Marianas signals deep loyalty to and
                    affinity for the islands. More than simply fashionable or trendy, these brands have
                    come to represent a set of cultural, social, and political values that resonate with the
                    wide spectrum of people who call the Marianas home.</p>

                <head>From Exotica to Erotica: Historical Fiction or Fictional History in Mariana Islands Novels, 2012-2017 (Anne Perez Hattori)</head>

                <p>Author Note: In March 2017, I received an email inquiry from Professor Carolina Rodriguez
                    of the University of Oviedo in Spain, faculty of American literatures and cultures. As part
                    of a research group studying literature written by American authors about “exotic” places,
                    she encountered Guam through her discovery of the novel, <em>Conquered: A WWII Erotic
                    Historical Romance Set in Guam</em>, written by CHamoru writer Paula Lujan Quinene.
                    Prof. Rodriguez took an interest in Guam's past and present and emailed to ask me to recom-
                    mend readings in order to learn more about us and our history. Her curiosity about Guam
                    and novels about the island spurred me to read <em>Conquered</em>, and from there, other recent
                    novels. It struck me that as a University of Guam professor who teaches classes in Guam
                    History and CHamoru Studies, I ought to be familiar with these publications. So, for that bit
                    of motivation and inspiration, I offer my thanks: <em>Si Yu'os Ma'åse</em>, Prof. Rodriguez.</p>

                <p>For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the “Pacific novel” referred to works
                    by Herman Melville, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Michener, and other Western
                    writers. More recent decades have seen the emergence of Indigenous novelists, led
                    by writers such as the late Epeli Hau'ofa of Tonga, Albert Wendt (Samoa), Sia Figiel
                    (Samoa), and Patricia Grace (Aotearoa New Zealand Māori). Indeed, fictional works
                    about islands in the South Pacific—that is, Oceanic islands below the equator—have
                    proliferated over the past 40 years.¹ The same, however, could not be said of our
                    region, as is attested by the near absence of Micronesian novels in Pacific Literature
                    classes across the region.² Since 2012, however, more than 10 novels have been pub-
                    lished that feature the Mariana Islands, the CHamoru people, and our Indigenous
                    culture, including four written by Natives and five others by authors who at one time
                    resided here. These novels make heavy use of island landscapes, CHamoru legends,
                    and Marianas history, sometimes as mere backdrops for their storylines but other
                    times as key ingredients in their plots' unfolding. This chapter, firstly, summarizes
                    some of these novels in the hopes that local readers might be inspired to seek them
                    out and read what others are writing about our islands and culture. Secondly, this
                    work analyzes some of the ways in which these novels represent CHamoru culture
                    and history—at times exotically and erotically. Thirdly, this project evaluates the
                    historical accuracy of the novels, assessing the degree to which the stories fairly and
                    ethically represent the actual historical events that inform their plots.</p>

                <p>… [Omitted transitional paragraphs or references to other specific novels, for brevity] …</p>

                <p><strong>Exotica and Erotica</strong><br/>
                    The Marianas landscapes featured in these contemporary novels are often described
                    in sensuous or romanticized ways. For instance, Paula Quinene's <em>Conquered</em> intermingles
                    vivid descriptions of Guam's lush scenery with the intimate encounters of its main
                    characters, forging a link between the tropical environment and erotic possibilities
                    (Quinene, 2012). Other authors also commingle the exotic island landscape with the
                    erotic sexuality of their CHamoru characters, males even more so than females. This
                    motif of linking the exotic and the erotic should come as no surprise: the global
                    tourism industry's portrayal of the Pacific as a place for weddings, honeymoons, and
                    escapist romance is well-entrenched, particularly in Polynesia and Micronesia. The
                    romantic climate and the tropic imagery serve as a popular literary backdrop.</p>

                <p><strong>Historical Fiction or Fictional History?</strong><br/>
                    All of the novels under review could be classified as works of historical fiction, a
                    genre that has become increasingly popular. Historian Jerome de Groot noted in
                    his 2010 <em>The Historical Novel</em> that “the last few decades have seen an explosion in the
                    sales and popularity of novels set in the past” (p. 152). Yet what qualifies as histori-
                    cal fiction is not a simple matter. Eastern Illinois University Professor Sarah Johnson
                    (n.d.), writing on behalf of the Historical Novel Society, offered a working definition
                    of the historical novel as “a novel which is set fifty or more years in the past, and one
                    in which the author is writing from research rather than personal experience” (para. 7).
                    Other scholars define the genre more inclusively, focusing on the subject matter,
                    rather than a strict historical timeline. For example, Daniel McGarry and Harriman
                    White, authors of the <em>World Historical Fiction Guide</em>, defined historical fiction more
                    broadly as works that include “reference to customs, conditions, identifiable persons,
                    or events in the past” (De Groot, 2010, p. 986).</p>

                <p>By McGarry and White's definition, each of the novels under review deals with
                    the Mariana Islands, its people, and culture in a historical context at some point.
                    Several situate their stories prior to or during WWII—hence relying heavily on
                    the details of those eras—while others are set in the present day but still draw
                    on local legends, the presence of ancient ruins like <em>latte</em> sites, or generational
                    recollections. The question then becomes how faithfully or ethically these novels
                    reflect the genuine historical record, as well as CHamoru cultural values, beliefs,
                    and experiences.</p>

                <p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong><br/>
                    The proliferation of these Mariana Islands-themed novels, many of which emphasize
                    lush tropical scenery and romantic or erotic elements, signals an expanding literary
                    interest in the region. Whether written by CHamorus or by longtime residents, these
                    works reveal a spectrum of historical accuracy. Some do an admirable job portraying
                    CHamoru characters as active agents within their own historical context, whereas
                    others tend toward exoticizing or flattening both the culture and its complex history.
                    A critical awareness is thus essential as local readers engage these novels. We do
                    well to celebrate their existence while also interrogating their portrayals—lest the
                    Marianas be reduced to little more than a backdrop for “island romance.”</p>

                    <head>Mamåhlao: for Indigenous Culture (Royce Camach)</head>

                <p>Successful composition is often measured by the writer's ability to present a unique
                    contribution to scholarship. In Foucault's (1984) description of authorship, “The
                    coming into being of the notion of ‘author' constitutes the privileged moment of
                    individualization in the history of ideas, knowledge, literature, philosophy, and the
                    sciences” (p. 101). To fulfill this expectation, many beginning composition students
                    in Guam, who may have lived their entire lives prioritizing interdependence, must
                    step outside of their cultural framework and instead see themselves as individuals to
                    complete their assignments. This is especially true for CHamorus, the Indigenous
                    people of Guam and the Marianas. CHamoru students entering the institution are
                    welcomed by first-year composition course textbooks that present claims such as,
                    “The positions of authority that academics are expected to hold and the kind of value
                    that academics place on conveying knowledge result in language and essay structures
                    that may be, to the outsider, mysterious or imposing” (Fontaine andamp; Smith, 2008, p.
                    3). Consequently, the students believe that the dissonance they experience is just a
                    natural part of negotiating their assimilation into scholarship. However, there may

                    be more at work in Guam and the surrounding island communities; many voices that
                    could bring Indigenous insight into academic spaces are practicing a silence, one cul-
                    turally reinforced by the CHamoru value known as “mamåhlao.”</p>

                <p>Mamåhlao has been described as “shame or embarrassment” and is seen as import-
                    ant because it “represents all the Chamorro ideas of what is proper and civilized
                    behavior” (Kasperbauer, 1996, p. 29). At least one common scenario exists in which
                    adherence to mamåhlao can be observed and better understood, but there are many.
                    It occurs at social gatherings when food or refreshments are offered to guests, and
                    according to principle, the intended recipients should refuse the first and even
                    second offering because accepting offers brazenly is viewed as “selfish, crude and
                    disrespectful,” and is a mark of “having no shame.” I have come to understand that
                    many cultures have adopted a similar perspective on accepting food. The value can
                    also be observed in collaborative settings like the classroom, when participants
                    are careful not to dominate the discourse or be perceived to “know-it-all” (have no
                    shame) because these are marked characteristics of a taimamåhlao (not mamåhlao)
                    attitude. A student may have to be called on a few times before offering an opinion.
                    In other words, the student “who ‘has shame' (mamåhlao) is always humble and
                    respectful [whether inside or outside the classroom]; he or she is honorable and
                    generous and caring of others” and will often put the group experience before any
                    urge to express their thoughts (p. 29). For those observing the tenets of mamåhlao, it
                    is more important to be seen as humble than to get “ahead,” even at the cost of going
                    without food so that others can get their fill, or conceding in an argument even if the
                    other party is incorrect.</p>

                <p>If this is the case—that the expectations of adhering to mamåhlao somehow re-
                    presses the fire of the Indigenous perspective, the CHamoru perspective—what is
                    the effect of encouraging students in the Marianas to draw on their experiences
                    and insights to contribute something valuable to Western academic discourse? As a
                    teacher in the Pacific, I often wonder what I am really asking of my students.</p>

                <p>In Plato's (2001) <em>Phaedrus</em>, Socrates relates the story of Theuth, the Egyptian god and
                    inventor of letters, who is challenged by King Thalus after boasting of writing's un-
                    paralleled utility. To Theuth's claim, King Thalus responds:
                    <br/><br/>
                    andemsp;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability
                    andemsp;to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;
                    andemsp;and now you, who are the father of letter, have been led by your affection to
                    andemsp;ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this
                    andemsp;invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it,
                    andemsp;because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced
                    andemsp;by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use
                    andemsp;of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory,
                    andemsp;but of reminding. (p. 165)</p>

                <p>There is a prevailing belief in many institutions that standard English and effec-
                    tive composition are one and the same. And this makes many weary of articulating
                    knowledge that is held as intimate when the primary measure of student ability and
                    intelligence is an adherence to proper grammar, organization, tense consistency,
                    and other academic conventions. Like Theuth, there are proponents of writing who
                    will encourage the student to mine Indigenous knowledge in order confirm or chal-
                    lenge some aspect of Western academic discourse. Many soon realize that, although
                    scholarship is valuable in academia, writing about the precepts of mamåhlao does
                    not refine mamåhlao culturing or prioritize Indigenous thought in the classroom.
                    In other words, it is difficult to serve the institution and your people. A worry is that
                    as CHamorus begin to see themselves as part of the academic tradition instead of
                    outside of it, they will refer to the literature (or the internet) to guide their behav-
                    ior before searching the contents of their soul, before seeking the wisdom of their
                    elders, before realizing that government policy and federal legislation (written word)
                    continue to twist their people into colonial submission.</p>

                <p>An uncle of mine passed recently, and 9 days of rosary followed before the funeral.
                    The rosaries took place outside the residence under five-or-six large canopies. One
                    canopy was designated just for tables of food. To a visitor, it may have looked more
                    like a celebration than a site of grieving. The rosary ended and the techa, my great-
                    aunt, asked everyone to stand and bless the table(s). From the living room, where the
                    immediate family was gathered, her voice carried outside through a small PA system.
                    A line formed after a couple minutes, with the kids first and the most senior in the
                    family close behind. The hosting family may pick at the finger food or have a cup of
                    soup, but they are mainly responsible for restocking the table or making room for</p>

                <p>another pot or plate of something that has just arrived. Someone has a little notebook
                    in hand to quietly record the names of the families that contribute a dish. That way,
                    when those families host a rosary or wedding, my family can return the favor.</p>

                <p>An elder will say, “We have to go because so-and-so came to your cousin's birthday
                    and brought two trays of buchi buchi.” The written reminders in the little notebooks
                    help to keep this system of reciprocity intact today, but who can recall how long
                    this exchange has been in practice, or remember all the families that have taken
                    part? That record does not live in memory. However, when it was time for my Nåna,
                    who has been gone for 20 years now, to bring a pot of something to her mother-in-
                    law's uncle's cousin's rosary many years ago, she did not have to keep a notebook
                    of reminders; the details inhabited her soul, as if mamåhlao was a featured soft-
                    ware in the Indigenous programming of CHamoru people. It determines how
                    CHamorus should allocate their attention, to whom or what they owe a reciprocal
                    responsibility, and it ensures interdependence. Mamåhlao is also understood as the
                    soul of CHamoru culturing, and described as an “attitude of deference for others”
                    (Cunningham, 1992, p. 92) or a “kind of intuitive measure which tells you when your
                    behavior is proper and decent” (Underwood, 1978, p. 17). Those that have no sense
                    of mamåhlao are said to have no shame (taimamåhlao) (Topping et al., 1975, p. 132).</p>

                <p>Presenting this kind of intimate cultural knowledge here and now, in this very text
                    you are reading, could be considered taimamåhlao, and students in Guam confront
                    this risk because they are expected to situate themselves in the academic tradition
                    (and concomitantly appreciate the privilege of individualization). In the process they
                    will be required to acknowledge the ongoing academic conversation, which includes
                    a colonial history that has declared Indigenous futility and promulgated the identity
                    of the demeaning place-name “Ladrones.” These early narratives, fueled by Western
                    European rhetoric, have asserted notions like, “there are no pure CHamorus,” that
                    the “CHamoru language is dying,” that the cultural practices of today are somehow
                    “less authentic than pre-contact traditions,” and that CHamorus needed and contin-
                    ue to depend on an external (colonial) force to propel them into modernity. Because
                    the literature they confront contradicts their lived experience, students often opt not
                    to touch cultural issues in their composition and defer to others, as if there are “ex-
                    perts” ready to write a revisionist CHamoru history, and as if they are not themselves
                    practitioners of the culturing taking place in their community.</p>

                <p>These colonial narratives continue to color the perception of CHamoru culturing,
                    allowing these notions to be reiterated in the classroom, as if race and ethnicity are
                    a measure of what is pure and authentic—and not constructs of our imagination.
                    Indigenous students could feel disadvantaged from the onset because it is difficult
                    to reconcile their framework of interdependence alongside expectations to be inde-
                    pendent scholars. Not only are they expected to distinguish themselves from others,
                    but they must also engage with literature that defines the CHamoru experience as
                    lesser. When asking students in Guam to synthesize cultural insights and present
                    these findings in a classroom, they are skeptical and even distrusting because they
                    know that Indigenous thought is often seen as a response to and result of Western
                    European discourse, instead of a parallel philosophy of equal value. Teachers have
                    a responsibility to equip students with the appropriate regional literature to contex-
                    tualize this historical perspective. Students who are not equipped may find it easier
                    to practice a conscious disassociation from academia altogether and pursue other
                    avenues of achievement.</p>

                <p>With social media and the internet facilitating a culture of accessibility, there
                    are endless paths to explore being CHamoru. In what has been called a
                    cultural resurgence, there is a palpable desire to brand the next trend, lifestyle,
                    or accouterment, and Indigenous undertones often get wrapped up in this
                    commercialization. For example, sinahi, which are crescent-shaped symbols of
                    seasonal renewal, are sported like fashion jewelry that can be made and worn by
                    anyone without coveting the lunar motifs that provide their cultural significance.
                    Using the symbol to communicate Indigenous knowledge about timing has remained
                    in tandem with the reification of a culturing that suggests “we could all be chiefs
                    now.” Another example is the contemporary depiction of latte, which are large stone
                    house posts, traditionally. These artifacts have been redesigned, resized, reinvented,
                    and included as images on websites or in DVDs shown to the Chinese, Russian,
                    Japanese, Korean, and American (military) markets. These visitors, expecting to
                    meet latte-makers, can instead stop at the Galleria or visit Chamorro Village, where
                    they can also buy sinahi and spondylus next to I ♥ Guam shirts.</p>

                <p>Those that dwell on the misappropriation of these symbols are often seen as old-fash-
                    ioned or “gate-keepers,” dwelling on issues that ultimately do not matter, and may
                    be labeled “taimamåhlao” for their unabashed expression of distaste. Meanwhile

                    hotel chains and real-estate agencies, restaurants and the fitness industry, tour agen-
                    cies and all manner of businesses use Indigenous artifacts to advertise their services
                    without a responsibility to serve and enrich Guam's Indigenous population, to which
                    these entities owe their marketability, at least in part. Maybe special consideration
                    should be extended to those whose life-long goal is to represent CHamoru-ness
                    judiciously so that the symbols that communicate Indigenous knowledge are not re-
                    duced to commercial products used to sell visitors a more exotic experience. While
                    some maintain that participants in our local community should value mamåhlao
                    attitudes, others see the distribution of cultural merchandise as a natural way of
                    negotiating space for CHamoru-ness in the modern era.</p>

                <p>Epitomizing Freud's narcissism of small differences, business entrepreneurs who
                    redesign cultural products for commercial distribution will be criticized for exploit-
                    ing Indigenous culture and other professionals condemned for putting on their
                    island-print shirts and “selling out.” Many toil away, endlessly debating the most
                    appropriate way to represent CHamoru-ness, while pressing issues like decoloniz-
                    ing consciousness and self-determination are passed over—a result of Guam being
                    inculcated by a history designed to haunt CHamorus into social disorder. Whether
                    in the academic tradition or on the open market, Indigenous participation is often
                    perceived to require a departure from Indigeneity—that CHamoru-ness must be
                    presented in a certain way to be marketable today. More haunting than a colonial
                    history is the reality that many CHamorus are not applying themselves because of a
                    sensed systemic disassociation between their language and cultural community on
                    one hand, and academia and capitalism on the other. An average of one self-inflict-
                    ed death per week occurs in Guam (Cruz, 2017), with systemic disassociation likely a
                    contributing factor. Teachers and educators, business entrepreneurs, politicians, en-
                    tertainers, and others all have a responsibility to guard the mental health of Guam's
                    people by creating space for Indigenous success.</p>

                <p>Just before the funeral service for my uncle at the Immaculate Heart of Mary
                    Catholic Church in Toto, a site of worship and grieving for generations of my family,
                    my great-aunt led the rosary. During one of the Lord's Prayers, she struggled to get
                    the words out. One of her nieces (my aunt) knelt by her side, just in range of the
                    microphone. They shared rosary beads, and with cues from my great-aunt, the
                    prayer picked up where it left off, but this time, in English. While the shift was by</p>

                <p>no means subtle, after 10 minutes a distinct cadence and style became apparent,
                    resembling the melodic mantra that has guided generations of CHamoru grieving.
                    Just like that, the voice of a new techa was recognized, validated not by an adher-
                    ence to an authentic language or a pure bloodline, but by an intuitive conviction
                    to serve interdependence. Mamåhlao culturing prioritizes interdependence. And
                    to the Indigenous writer, mamåhlao often means speaking through the writing
                    and ideas of others and only conveying a unique contribution in the absence of
                    a more authoritative voice. In other words, “Since decisions [are] never individual
                    decisions, it [is] not proper to express personal opinion directly. To do so [slows]
                    down the process of reaching an interdependent group consensus” (Cunningham,
                    1992, p. 92). Indigenous writing will benefit from an audience that is willing to read
                    between the lines and discern the argument being made with the same attention to
                    the text that we afford the greats.</p>

                <p>The notion of “individualization in the history of ideas” is a great opportunity af-
                    forded to the modern writer, but the modern writer is also plagued by too much
                    information, and there is enough arguing in the comment sections across the in-
                    ternet to go around. I have begun coaching my students to select the writers they
                    agree with or the material they find worth consuming, and have that be a feature
                    in their writing, instead of instructing them to set themselves apart from an already
                    established perspective. Point out a scholar or business owner or politician in Guam
                    that has it all wrong, and be prepared to explain yourself to family members of yours
                    and theirs alike at the next rosary. Even if you make a solid point, you may still be
                    viewed as taimamåhlao for causing a stir in the first place.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="6">
                    <head>Fourth Day (Gerard van Gils)</head>

                <p>And on the third day of school, two boys rose from their desks, wildly punching
                    each other in the face.</p>

                <p>I had divided my students into groups of four. They were working on their projects in
                    “American History” (scarcely mentioned, as my students do not often see American
                    history as their history). As I rounded the room, failing to keep everyone on task, I
                    apparently paired two boys into the same group without knowing anything of their
                    extensive history. So, one boy tried to cheat an answer from another, some comment
                    was sent back, threats were made, memories resurrected of prior offenses given and
                    received. And so it was that on my third day as a teacher at Kagman High School, I
                    calmly tried to break up a fight in my classroom. It was perhaps the most frightened
                    I had ever been. I almost ran out of the room to go find a real teacher.</p>

                <p>At the time I entered my Saipan classroom, I had a certification that said I was
                    a “Highly Qualified” public educator. I had never stepped into a classroom or

                    observed a full day in school—but I was “highly qualified” because I took a test
                    called the Praxis and passed. My college degree is in Political Science, but I had
                    spent my career as a banker in Utah. When I began my career in education in the
                    Northern Mariana Islands, I was a stay-at-home dad and was, quite frankly, looking
                    for a place to fit in. I volunteered to coach a high school soccer team and enjoyed the
                    young people I coached. So, I started applying for open positions, of which there
                    were plenty, and was hired at Kagman High School. I was not likely to last. I had no
                    cultural understanding of my students, no professional practice or education, and I
                    was not well paid, working full time for less than $30,000.</p>

                <p>What I did not realize during those first days on the job is that public education
                    in this country has serious illnesses, and I was merely a symptom: it is difficult to
                    find quality teachers and to keep them. It is even harder to hire and retain quality
                    teachers in remote and rural areas.</p>

                <p>Around the country, school districts create pathways for college-educated people,
                    like me, to become teachers either right out of college or coming from other careers.
                    New teachers are essentially learning alongside their students, while often acting as
                    if they have all the answers. It had been 13 years since I graduated from high school,
                    and now, returning as the teacher, nothing had really changed: I was still looking for
                    answers in the back of the book.</p>

                <p>I had crashed from teacher idealism to harsh reality in just 3 days. On my first
                    day, I was sure that I was answering the call to be a “hero teacher.” I had somehow
                    convinced myself that I was going to be exactly what these kids were waiting for. I
                    remember telling one girl, Talianna, that I was “the best shot she had!” I still do not
                    know what the hell I meant. In short, I was arrogant and had a savior complex. I was
                    sure that these kids needed me. I did not realize it was the other way around.</p>

                <p>Then the third day came, forcibly reversing my worldview. My young students' black
                    eyes were swelling up like water balloons on a slow fill. I dragged the boys to the office
                    and as we walked, I asked them, “Why were you fighting? How could you disrespect
                    my classroom?” They both tried to explain with phrases like, “He atan båba'd me!”
                    and “Pår, I never disrepeck notheen!” I could not understand anything they said, and
                    I told them so. Exasperated, I pleaded with them, saying, “Just help me understand!”
                    “Sir, no disrespect. You can't get it because you don't know me.”</p>

                <p>Today, as a teacher at the same school for more than 6 years, I remember this as one
                    of my earliest and most powerful lessons. “You can't teach me, because you don't
                    know me.” A powerfully accurate criticism, delivered sharply to his teacher, by a
                    9th grade boy who had just been punched in the face. And so keenly disarmed, I
                    surrendered the point. “I think you're right. I hope you'll give me the chance to get to
                    know you.” The last bit was all the difference.</p>

                <p>The remoteness and size of the islands mean that classrooms are often filled with
                    local kids but led by fresh and hopeful teachers who are new to the islands. Some of
                    these teachers are rigid, expecting island students to conform to their expectations
                    without investing the effort to understand the context from which their students
                    come. This was exactly my mistake.</p>

                <p>At the beginning, I saw myself as the “Shining White Knight” kind of teacher, sent
                    to save the villagers. I have seen similar teachers arrive every August, many of whom
                    are like me and without previous teaching experience. While I still feel the tenden-
                    cies, I recognize that the desire to save the world is terribly arrogant. Even the desire
                    to “save one kid” is rooted in a narcissism of which I have been guilty. If you go into
                    the classroom with a cape on, trying to be a superhero, you will wear yourself out
                    and fail. Teachers must enter the classroom with an appreciation of the unknown
                    and learn as much as they teach. To know the young people of the islands is to love
                    them, and they love their teachers back. And they learn from teachers they love.</p>

                <p>This phenomenon is acute in education, whether it's a suburban teacher entering
                    an inner-city classroom or a continental teacher entering an island one. On the is-
                    lands, the cultural divide occurs outside education as well since many professionals
                    are educated elsewhere and visiting the islands on a two-year contract. A sizable
                    portion of the island's doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals are from
                    elsewhere. They all, to some degree, suffer this disconnect. But if an engineer does
                    not connect with his peers on a level of cultural understanding, the generators can
                    still get fixed. A surgeon can take out an appendix on an Indigenous person as easily
                    as on an immigrant. But in education, the entire outcome seems to hinge on a teach-
                    er's ability to relate to the student. That ability to relate is required. We educators</p>

                <p>learn and adapt to the ways of these islands. The Public School System requires
                    teachers to take continuing education credits in CNMI history, but I think the real
                    burden should be on the teachers. We educators need to learn the lay of the land,
                    make some local friends, and internalize Indigenous culture. Acclimate to the trop-
                    ics in ways beyond the climate. Life is a lot more comfortable when we settle in with
                    the people and learn more than we teach.</p>

                <p>I am terribly afraid to fail, and sometimes that fear paralyzes me. I think to myself,
                    “I'd rather not try at it—I'll probably suck.” My fear of failure is something I work
                    on, and luckily teaching has provided me ample practice. Being a teacher is a ter-
                    ribly difficult job, and I think those who are brave enough to try it deserve honor
                    and respect from their communities. Teaching is a career of daily failure. It is a job
                    where most days, you fail to reach at least some of the kids placed before you. Even
                    more difficult, the students who are most in need often do not have the vocabu-
                    lary and emotional understanding to ask for help. So, on any good day, a wonderful
                    teacher will miss opportunities to love and teach. That burden weighs on educators.
                    Despite all the good they do, teachers stay up late at night worrying about the stu-
                    dents they cannot reach.</p>

                <p>The emotional struggle of teaching is compounded for off-island educators who
                    struggle in a new climate, culture, and job. High school teachers everywhere are man-
                    aging upwards of 120–150 kids a day, of various abilities, attention spans, and smells.
                    Some kids smell so bad that your eyes water, but teachers love those smelly kids any-
                    ways. Everything is hard for teachers. They are broke and mosquito-bitten. They need
                    friends and support or we'll lose them at the conclusion of their two-year contracts.
                    The Northern Mariana Islands have lost too many wonderful and worn-out teachers.</p>

                <p>My help came from new friends. I became friends with a younger guy, a high school
                    dropout as it turns out. My attempts to help him “improve” his life were unwelcome,
                    and so I was not sure what I was supposed to do “for” him. DJ told me we could just
                    “chill,” and so we did. Soon afterwards I visited his farm, attended a baby shower,
                    and witnessed my first cockfight—all on the same first visit. I saw a pregnant mother
                    open <em>Goodnight Moon</em>, and then I saw one rooster murder another rooster. I lost $20
                    betting on the red.</p>

                <p>Another friend, Peter, invited me to a poker game at his house. Peter is the art teach-
                    er at Kagman High School, and he is a master educator. I said to Peter, “I'm nervous
                    to go to your poker game where I'm the only non-local. I'm not sure how to behave,
                    got any advice?” He was a good friend and cultural guide. His advice for making
                    local friends at the poker table was simple: “lose.” And I did, and I kept going back,
                    and I kept losing money and making friends. Humbling to say, it turns out I was
                    never losing on purpose. I'm terrible at poker, but I have a lot of friends who will
                    welcome me to their tables.</p>

                <p>Auntie Josie, a matronly Carolinian, took me in like a nephew and told me I was
                    family. She wove birds out of coconut leaves for my daughters and taught me to make
                    a <em>mwáár</em>. Her boys tried to teach me to <em>mass</em>. She told me about Pågan, where she was
                    born, and how she hopes to go back and teach there some day. Teachers like her build
                    communities, whole islands even.</p>

                <p>My early semesters teaching were busy and filled with learning. I grew into this
                    place. I released some of my closely held surety and asked more questions. I listened,
                    and I learned. I relaxed and had fun, too. Soon, my students were laughing with
                    me. Disciplinary issues were gone. A class spontaneously applauded me when one
                    naughty boy showed attitude, and I snapped back, “ … wettz?” which is a Northside
                    Saipan slang word roughly expressing disbelief and shock.</p>

                <p>There were still days, like the third day, when I came home feeling like I had just
                    carefully managed a brush fire. But there were more good days to add balance.
                    There was progress in my students, and we were all happier. Students were hanging
                    out in my room even when I wanted them to leave. I would see them around town,
                    and they would come to hug me in the stores. The community had always wanted to
                    welcome me, but I needed to get to know them first. I had to do my part.</p>

                <p>In education, the good days get you through the difficult days. Sometimes, the good
                    days and the difficult days are one and the same. Once, when I was feeling really
                    low and was noticeably alone in a large crowd, a woman grabbed my hand and said,
                    “Mr. G? I am Victor's mom.” She hugged me, and we were both instantly crying,
                    while everyone around us found a reason to look away. Victor is a brilliant young
                    man with special needs. Victor treated his teachers to a steady flow of mathematical</p>

                <p>brilliance that was fractured by social difficulty. He would often storm out of class,
                    fists clenched, and usually it was for something I had done. I had triggered him and
                    Boom! —we were on a screaming outburst. Over Christmas break, we worked on
                    a scholarship application for about three weeks straight. Victor wrote a beautiful
                    essay about how he did not want to be a leader, and about how his puzzled brain
                    made him see the world differently and how that made his education a worthy in-
                    vestment. Victor won a Gates Millennium Scholarship. When I met his mother for
                    the first time, she knew what Victor had put me through, and I knew some of what
                    she had endured raising him. We were both filled with overwhelming gratitude
                    for the struggles and the successes. Victor is amazing and kind, and I got to be his
                    teacher. It was one example of many explaining why teaching is the best job in the
                    world, and why teachers should stick with it. I scarcely remember the hard days with
                    Victor. I remember Victor, with his backpack stuffed, walking up the ramp at the
                    airport, flying to Eastern Oregon University on a full ride.</p>

                <p>For 500 years, these islands have had a stream of people come ashore with plans for
                    what they would make of the people and the place; I brought plans with me when
                    I came as well. What I fortunately learned is to reverse the order. I invited these
                    people and this place to change me, make something of me, and I learned to teach.</p>

                <p>I recently spoke, again, with my student, Talianna. She had witnessed my early
                    days teaching, when I acted as the noble “first-day teacher-hero.” Talianna was
                    now one of my Million Dollar Scholars, Kagman High School students who were
                    preparing as cohorts to attend college. I asked Talianna if she remembered my first
                    day. She did not let me even finish the question, “Yes! Oh my God, Mr. G, you were
                    the weirdest! You came in talking like you were going to rescue us from all the
                    terrible things or something. You sounded … like … a crazy person.” She was right,
                    but it still hurt to remember. Then she continued, “But you weren't weird for too
                    long. You got better, I think, as you got to know us.”</p>

                <p>I dedicate these words, from my heart, to the noble educators of these islands who
                    come back on the fourth day and every day.</p>

                <head>The Halo Halo (“Mix Mix”) Generation (Tabitha Caser Espina)</head>

                <p>I am called “Balikbayan” because the girl in me is a country of rope hammocks and wal-
                    ing-waling orchids—a land with irresistible gravity because, in it, I forget the world's
                    magnificent indifference. In this country, my grandmother's birthland, even the dead are
                    never cold and I become a child at ease with trawling through rooms in the dark.
                    <br/>
                    —“Corolla” by Eileen Tabios (2000),<br/>
                    <em>Babaylan: An Anthology of Filipina and Filipina American Writers</em>, xxi.⁷
                    </p>

                <p>Translated literally, <em>halo halo</em> means “mix mix” in the Filipino language. In preparing
                    the <em>halo halo</em> dessert, an assortment of native ingredients, such as jackfruit (<em>langka</em>),
                    <em>saba</em> bananas, sweet potatoes (<em>kamote</em>), red mung beans, young coconut (<em>buko</em>), fla-
                    vored gelatin, and the quintessential purple yam (<em>halayang ube</em>) are mixed together,
                    typically in a clear glass. These ingredients are added and apportioned according
                    to taste. Shaved ice is piled on top before evaporated milk is poured over all the
                    ingredients. As all the ingredients are mixed, they are subsumed and sublated into
                    the dominant, white milk mixture. In <em>halo halo</em>, although each item maintains its
                    distinctive flavor, the overall taste experience is the result of the blending of flavors.</p>

                <p>As in the Filipino <em>halo halo</em> dessert, there is both a distinctiveness and a mixing
                    that occur in the identity negotiations of immigrant third-generation Filipinos.
                    Third-generation youth in America find themselves situated, as sociologist Peggy
                    Levitt (2009) argues, between a variety of different and often competing gener-
                    ational, ideological, and moral reference points, including those of their parents,
                    their grandparents, and their own real and imagined perspectives about their
                    multiple identities and their homelands. Filipinos comprise a significant part
                    of the population worldwide, within the United States, the Mariana Islands, and
                    Guam. An estimated 2.2 million Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) were employed
                    overseas in 2016 (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2017). Filipinos now comprise the
                    second-largest immigrant group and second-largest Asian American group in the
                    United States, according to Yen Le Espiritu's (2003) chronicle of Filipino lives across
                    cultures, communities, and countries. Filipinos comprised the single largest ethnic
                    group employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in
                    2005 (CNMI Department of Commerce/Central Statistics Division, 2008). In Guam,
                    Filipinos are the second-largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 26.3% of the
                    island's population (Central Intelligence Agency, 2017). The Filipino population in
                    Guam has grown steadily from post-World War II to today, from approximately 7,258
                    in 1950 to approximately 42,057 in 2012 (US Census Bureau, 2017; Central Intelligence
                    Agency, 2017). As Filipino immigrants have made their homes all over the world,
                    their descendants continue to reconcile conceptions of home and belonging.</p>

                <p>This chapter explores the enunciations of identity of third-generation Filipinos in
                    Guam, whom I term the Halo Halo generation, through my own narratives of au-
                    toethnography and through poems by two prolific local slam poets: Verna Zafra,
                    whose work interrogates Western conceptions of feminism and laments the loss of
                    her culture; and John “Metaforce” Sarmiento, whose work uses Filipino characters
                    to capture the attitudes of the young, contemporary generation. <em>Halo halo</em>,
                    “mix mix,” then, is an apt metaphor for the “mixing” that occurs in the identity enuncia-
                    tions of third-generation Filipinos in Guam.</p>

                <p>Inspired by Filipina poet Eileen Tabios (2000) in her poem “Corolla,” I will be “col-
                    laging” the works of my peers to contextualize and frame my own narratives. This
                    collage strategy references not only the identities of contemporaries but also the ex-
                    periences of previous generations to ground elusive identities. Young Filipinos can
                    rewrite the words of their parents and grandparents to create a collage of collective
                    experience that may help them better understand their position as members of the
                    Filipino community in Guam.</p>

                <p>By using the literary expressions of young Filipinos, I emphasize the significance
                    of our personal experiences in exploring the attitudes and ideas of this large popu-
                    lation in Guam. Narrative, according to narrative theorist David Herman (2009), is
                    “a basic human strategy for coming to terms with time, process, and change,” and
                    interpreting such expressions from where they emerge is essential to understanding
                    the thoughts, ideas, and attitudes of this contemporary generation (Introduction,
                    para. 2). I incorporate these theories into the <em>halo halo</em> theoretical metaphor I have
                    devised, as Wai-Chee Dimock (1991) suggests in her study of feminist new histori-
                    cism, to describe the complexities of life as a coherent system to be organized and
                    interpreted into some semblance of clarity and order. Using the <em>halo halo</em> dessert as
                    a scholarly term, as opposed to standard Western terminology, signifies progression
                    and hybridity, according to feminist cultural theorist Gloria Anzaldúa (2001), and
                    enables Filipino Americans to provide name and shape to this concept as our own.</p>

                <p>In the Halo Halo generation, a variety of Filipino and Guamanian cultural elements
                    is chosen from and added together according to “taste.” While I recognize that
                    the term “Guamanian” is fraught with identity politics and has been criticized for
                    contributing to the erasure of Guam's Indigenous people, I use this term primarily
                    for consistency and familiarity, referring to Filipinos' colonial settler position on
                    Guam. I want to portray how these distinct cultural experiences are then mixed
                    with, subsumed, and sublimated into the dominant American culture through
                    complex processes that include acculturation and assimilation. This “mixing” is
                    attributed to a multitude of processes, which often diminish cultural distinctions
                    by varied degrees. I argue that the Halo Halo generation acts within the spectrum
                    of acculturation and assimilation, often altering the Filipino values of parents and
                    grandparents and privileging American values over both Filipino and Guamanian
                    cultures. This combination occurs against a backdrop of Westernization, one legacy</p>

                <p>of which is the colonial mentality that either values or devalues, favors or rejects
                    various characteristics. Just as the local ingredients are often mashed into and inun-
                    dated in milk to become an opaque, milky mixture, American values and cultural
                    norms flood Filipino values and cultural norms, coloring and flavoring them. Under
                    the influence of the “white milk” of Westernization, the identity of the third-gener-
                    ation Filipinos becomes more homogenized as compared to previous generations,
                    assimilating Filipino, as well as Guamanian, cultural distinctions into a pervasive
                    American culture. I am optimistic, however, that the <em>halo halo</em> dessert's inclusion
                    of the <em>halayang ube</em> ingredient symbolizes the “roots” of Filipino culture as an es-
                    sential ingredient of Halo Halo identity.⁸ At the same time, the Guamanian identity,
                    symbolized by the presence of the <em>buko</em>, or young coconut, in the <em>halo halo</em> dessert,
                    adds a dimension of complexity to the Halo Halo identity. Though still existent, the
                    “root” element of the <em>ube</em> and the “seed” element of the <em>buko</em> become dissolved into
                    the mixture, imperceptible but nonetheless present to create a distinct flavor. Just as
                    <em>halo halo</em> is no simple shaved ice, the Halo Halo generation is more than the sum of
                    its cultural ingredients and experiences.</p>

                <p><strong>Am I Not an Island Girl?</strong><br/>
                    While I, like many of my Filipino peers, grew up in Guam, my attempts to under-
                    stand the different cultures that comprise my identity have often left me unsatisfied
                    and unsettled. Like the mixture of ingredients in <em>halo halo</em> preparation, I am pro-
                    vided with a mix of cultures and contexts, from which I choose to suit my changing
                    tastes. Interestingly, however, the result has been the sharp, sometimes bitter taste
                    of disillusionment and ambivalence, instead of a mixing of “flavors” that might pro-
                    duce a unique and enjoyable blend.⁹</p>

                <p>I am a third-generation Filipina. At the age of four, I became Guam's youngest
                    recording artist, singing with my mother, Alpha Espina (1994), on her Christmas
                    album, <em>Back to You</em>. At seven-years-old, I then released a solo album (Figure 1), <em>Tabitha
                    Espina: Island Girl</em> (1997), in which the title track contained words in CHamoru,
                    Guam's native language.�� Throughout my childhood, I regularly performed as “The
                    Island Girl” at malls, local fiestas, charity fundraisers, and community and govern-
                    ment-sponsored events, even being sponsored by Fox Network in Saipan to perform
                    in my own concert. Although I enjoyed performing, throughout primary school, I
                    was constantly teased, “You're not an island girl! You're Filipina!”</p>

                <p>Until then, I had not realized that I was not an “authentic island girl.” I was born
                    and raised in Guam and had only thought of the Philippines as a place where my
                    family vacationed. Though I had claimed Guam as my home, claiming to be one
                    of its “island girls” was crossing a line—an invisible border that delineated where I
                    did not and could not belong. By internalizing this putative border, I had allowed it
                    to cause me to doubt my own definition. I felt like Hélène Cixous's (1993) uncertain
                    border crosser, “who trembles while crossing a border [and thus] casts doubt on
                    [her] own definition … What ‘nature' [am I]? What ‘species' [am I]?” (p. 131). Once
                    conscious of these borders, I could not navigate between cultures as seamlessly as
                    I had once done. From then on, I had to question what I was allowed to say or do
                    because I am Filipina.</p>

                <p>This research admittedly began as an exploration of my own identity. I employ the
                    use of personal experience in my autoethnographic study of identity as a method
                    to demonstrate some aspects of third-generation Filipina identity that have only
                    begun to be theorized. An autoethnographic approach, like that used by Peruvemba
                    S. Jaya (2011), can act as a catalyst for reflection on issues surrounding diaspora and
                    the meanings of identity within the context of globalization. The inclusion of my
                    personal experience in this research is therefore part of a reflexive process, wherein
                    I influence and am influenced by my findings.¹¹</p>

                <p>Espiritu (2003), in her chronicle of Filipino American lives across cultures, commu-
                    nities, and countries, describes how political and cultural mechanisms designed
                    to restrict membership are created everywhere within a nation, setting clear but
                    imaginary boundaries between who is “inside” and who is “outside.” The third
                    generation, then, lives in a mixed, “halo halo” world, and it is the divisions of this
                    world that engenders their Halo Halo identity. Espiritu (2003) finds, however, that
                    although Filipinos are discursively produced as foreign and are pressured to carry
                    figurative borders around with them, their self-made multiple subject positions and
                    transnational connections repeatedly push against these borders, as I found myself
                    doing. Because of these persistent borders and the push against them, Filipinos
                    of the Halo Halo generation lead a double or multiple existence—they have inte-
                    grated into Guam society as generational colonial settlers, but the original sense of
                    foreignness experienced by their immigrant ancestors continues to pervade their
                    experience. They feel that Guam is their home but may not feel fully at home. They
                    recognize that they are ethnically Filipino but sometimes feel shame in their heri-
                    tage, are reluctant to claim certain aspects of Filipino culture, and may also feel out
                    of place in the Filipino community.</p>

                <p>These feelings of being unfamiliar and ill-equipped are captured in Verna Zafra's
                    (2015) poem, “Tools,” published in <em>As Us: A Space for the Women of the World</em>. Zafra
                    is a young Filipina poet raised in Guam who uses written and slam poetry to ex-
                    plore themes of negotiation and empowerment. The emphasis of her engagement in
                    poetry is service, as she served as a mentor and the Program Director of Sinangån-ta
                    Youth Movement, Guam's official youth slam and spoken word organization until
                    2015. With an ear towards the youth, Zafra (2015) describes her experience of visiting
                    relatives in the Philippines:</p>

                <p>We crossed into mountain-backed fields<br/>
                    It was my first time;<br/>
                    Theirs, they had lost count.<br/>
                    Like hardened soldiers,<br/>
                    They trudged the paths<br/>
                    Of sword grass,<br/>
                    Retracing the steps of their mothers<br/>
                    And brothers and fathers –<br/>
                    The vague ghosts of my bloodline.<br/>
                    And with graceful dexterity,<br/>
                    They put their tools to use.<br/>
                    Tools that tilled and weeded,<br/>
                    Tended and sowed,<br/>
                    Indifferent to the black mud,<br/>
                    Even to their own calloused abuse.</p>

                <p>Zafra's poem shows her passage through rugged terrain, which is new for her but
                    part of the everyday lives of her relatives. The beginning of her poem contrasts their
                    lifestyles, with her relatives marked by generations of “hardened” trudging. Zafra
                    admires their commitment to the traditions of their ancestors, while plaintively de-
                    scribing her ghostly tenuousness. Using the metaphor of “tools,” she compares their
                    skill, ease, and capability, with her inability and reluctance. Zafra's observation is,
                    overall, marked by shame in her different lifestyle, lack of skills, and fragile connec-
                    tion to her cultural heritage.</p>

                <p>Like Zafra, the slam poetry of John Norman “Metaforce” Sarmiento confronts the
                    issue of belonging among youth. Sarmiento has been widely affiliated with the Halo
                    Halo generation. In 2015, he represented Guam in Paris, France, as he was chosen
                    by the Global Call for Climate Action group to perform his poetry at the United
                    Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sarmiento's dynamic poetry
                    articulates his fascination with his Filipino-American-Guamanian culture but also
                    his tensions with it.</p>

                <p>Sarmiento's unpublished poem, “Blind Tongue,” voices the Halo Halo generation's
                    battle with boundaries set up by definitions of the authentic and inauthentic.
                    Because young Filipinos are classified by the first and second generations of immi-
                    grants as neither “this” nor “that” after all of the “mixing” of being caught between
                    cultures, there is a sense of being caught between identities:</p>

                <p>You were born in a white room<br/>
                    beneath white lights<br/>
                    wrapped in a white blanket,<br/>
                    but raised in the grey area<br/>
                    <br/>
                    of being from here<br/>
                    but not really from here.<br/>
                    ..........................<br/>
                    ‘cause your eyes<br/>
                    don't speak enough Tagalog.<br/>
                    Your tongue is blind<br/>
                    to what it can't understand.<br/>
                    Taste test your Filipino culture on China.<br/>
                    Refuse it ‘cause the flavor isn't English enough.<br/>
                    ..........................<br/>
                    You're not Filipino<br/>
                    or CHamoru enough<br/>
                    to be from anywhere.<br/>
                    This is not your island.<br/>
                    It belongs to the activists.<br/>
                    They just let you live here.<br/>
                    You have no right to contribute to the island's destiny.<br/>
                    You are one in a thousand products of immigration<br/>
                    stuck in this CHamoru class.<br/>
                    You are Filipino-American.</p>

                <p>Sarmiento describes his birth as shrouded in a sterile, ominous whiteness that
                    houses him, enlightens him, and encases him. He recognizes that he is born into
                    a position surrounded by the “whiteness” of American Western culture, which is
                    common for Filipino Americans born in the United States and oriented towards
                    American norms and values. For Sarmiento, the “grey area of being from here but
                    not really from here” is a combination of white and dark, as he is born into the
                    “white” of the United States in Guam but is still affected by the “dark” unknown of
                    his Filipino ancestry. It is because of this “grey area” that Sarmiento feels his tongue
                    is “blind”—both his language and tastes are not Filipino and he blindly rejects what
                    is not “English enough.” Restricted by feelings of insufficiency, he grieves not being
                    enough of a Filipino or CHamoru (i.e., one of Guam's Indigenous people), making
                    him unable to fully inhabit or contribute to Guam's community, or any community.
                    He expresses feelings of not belonging, having no claim to the island as his home,
                    and having no rights. He condemns himself for being just another product of
                    immigration, lacking originality and significance, and being “stuck” in a culture that
                    is not his own. These distressing emotions encapsulate the position of Sarmiento
                    and others of the Halo Halo generation. Caught in the act of trying to cross a
                    guarded border, they are left stranded with feelings of insufficiency, inauthenticity,
                    estrangement, and inadequacy.</p>

                <p>Borders create anxiety. In <em>The Filipino Americans (The New Americans)</em>, Barbara M.
                    Posadas (1999) remarks that cohesion and fragmentation simultaneously character-
                    ize young Filipino Americans. Considering their transnational struggles, Diane L.
                    Wolf (2002) finds that the distress of Filipino youth, particularly females, is great-
                    er than that experienced by other groups and must be further explored through
                    individual circumstances and contextualized within historical, political, and ra-
                    cialized relations. Nadal (2011) describes Filipino youth's struggles as “acculturative
                    stress,” due to the conflicting processes of negotiating between the boundaries of
                    acculturation and assimilation (p. 53). Sarmiento's metaphoric “blind tongue” is
                    representative of the second stage of Nadal's (2004) Pilipino Identity Development
                    Model, “Assimilation to Dominant Culture,” in which Filipino Americans realize
                    they are different from dominant cultural norms and may attempt to assimilate into
                    the dominant culture and reject being Filipino. While the majority of young Filipino
                    Americans may appear apathetic and uninterested in understanding their complex
                    identities, beginning to acknowledge and interrogate this apathy signifies the be-
                    ginnings of a shift in ideology. While apathy is revealed in my narrative through my
                    self-defeating creation of restrictive borders, in Zafra's disillusioned conclusion, as
                    well as in Sarmiento's conceding that the island can never be his home because of
                    his felt inadequacies, the mere speaking out and pronouncement of these feelings
                    is the opposite of apathy and disinterest. While they speak of a sentiment that sug-
                    gests passivity, these narratives simultaneously and proactively contemplate these
                    emotions, instead displaying agency and assertion.</p>

                <p><strong>“Aiy, No Me?”: Resisting Anomie</strong><br/>
                    Confronted with feelings of alienation and inauthenticity within their American
                    and Guamanian contexts, the Halo Halo generation may attempt to break down
                    barriers or boundaries to help ground their sense of identity. Linda A. Revilla (1997)
                    argues in “Filipino American Identity: Transcending the Crisis,” that part of the
                    “identity crisis” of youth in the Filipino American community is reconciling issues of</p>

                <p>self-love and self-respect as Filipinos. In “On Both Sides of The Hyphen: Exploring
                    the Filipino-American Identity,” Ma. Teresa G. Tuason et al. (2007) write that it is
                    not that US-born Filipino Americans devalue Filipino customs and traditions, but
                    rather they grew up mostly deprived of and unfamiliar with their Filipino heritage.
                    However, while the work of Tuason et al. considers only Filipinos born in the US
                    mainland, an unfamiliarity with Filipino customs can be found in the narratives
                    of the Halo Halo generation who grew up and came into adulthood in Guam. Wolf
                    (2002) describes young Filipino Americans' ethnic affiliation as a “largely symbolic
                    sense of ethnicity,” in which Filipino language, culture, and traditions are derived
                    from experiences that are intermittent, brief, and disconnected from the rest of
                    their lives (p. 263). The narratives of the Halo Halo generation reflect what Wolf
                    (2002) describes as an “allegiance to an imagined past” (p. 263). While the Halo Halo
                    generation identifies as Filipino, they also must contemplate what it means to be
                    a Filipino in Guam.</p>

                <p>In my own personal attempt to actively seek out my Filipino heritage, I entered a
                    Filipino pageant sponsored by a local United Filipino Students Association. While
                    other contestants answered the questions in “Taglish” (code-switching between
                    Tagalog and English), I was ashamed that I could only respond in English and even
                    sheepishly appealed to the host for a translation whenever he spoke in Tagalog. As
                    other contestants incorporated Filipino dances and songs into their performances,
                    I sang and danced to a song in English and spoke only the one Tagalog phrase of
                    “Hindi kita malilimutan”—ironically translated, “I will never forget you.” I was,
                    much to my surprise, given the title crown of Miss Teen Philippines-Guam 2006 and
                    then as title-holder, I participated in various Filipino cultural events and spoke on
                    Filipino television and talk shows. Each experience made me uncomfortably aware
                    that I was pretending to celebrate a Filipino culture and history that remained largely
                    unknown to me. I felt unfit to represent Guam's Filipino community, to which I had
                    never truly felt I belonged. I wondered, “Does being Filipina make me any less con-
                    nected to Guam? Does being from Guam make me any less of a Filipina? Does being
                    an American enrich or hinder my understanding of my Filipino culture, as it is ex-
                    pressed in Guam?” Once again, I felt inauthentic and questioned the symbolism of the
                    hyphen in my Miss Teen Philippines-Guam title: the hyphen between “Philippines”
                    and “Guam” was the border I inhabited. Like the hyphen, I felt nested—constricted
                    even—between the two communities, two cultures. Like Espiritu's (2003) invisible</p>

                <p>borders, that hyphen attempted to define who I was and who I was not, to what extent
                    I was from the Philippines and to what extent from Guam. This hyphenated identity
                    meant, to me, that I was neither fully one nor the other.</p>

                <p>My experience in the pageant was somewhat detached, as I was able to appreciate
                    the culture and participate in the festivities only to a certain extent because they
                    were not a regular part of my daily life. Although I prefaced my performance pro-
                    claiming, “I will never forget you,” truthfully, I could not forget a Filipino culture
                    that I never actually knew or remembered in the first place. This avowal instead
                    attested to a longing and a desire to remember what had yet to be known.</p>

                <p>It also attested to a more subtle crisis—the tension between love and respect of
                    the self and shame and rejection, as Revilla (1997) argues in “Filipino American
                    Identity: Transcending the Crisis.” This complex crisis results not from a devaluing
                    of whatever is Filipino but from a deprivation that then imagines Filipino as alien,
                    as something outside of the self (Revilla, 1997). There is thus a divide in identity, as
                    pride in one's culture is intermingled with shame in not knowing it enough.</p>

                <p>In her unpublished poem, “Moving Mountains,” Zafra also examines her tension
                    between self-respect and shame. She begins by challenging the impositions of soci-
                    ety that attempt to dictate her behavior:</p>

                <p>Growing up,<br/>
                    I was told that the only way<br/>
                    To survive in this world<br/>
                    As a woman<br/>
                    Is not to show weakness:<br/>
                    I was told to always keep my head high,<br/>
                    My voice loud,<br/>
                    And my skin tough,<br/>
                    Because anything that looked less than strength<br/>
                    Instantly made me a liability,<br/>
                    A burden to myself</p>

                <p>But I have walked through 23 years<br/>
                    With my head bowed,<br/>
                    Not because I am ashamed,<br/>
                    But because I have learned<br/>
                    That I cannot show respect<br/>
                    By having my chin up in the air,<br/>
                    But lowered in a sign of regard<br/>
                    For others and their struggles<br/>
                    That I'll never know about</p>

                <p>Zafra begins by criticizing what she has been told. She interrogates these gender
                    roles imposed by Western culture, and she explains in the rest of her poem that
                    these expectations are incongruous with her own expressions of womanhood. She
                    feels the need to justify her behavior, claiming that her seeming timidity is not for
                    lack of strength, but because of it. Her perceived timidity is instead a regard for what
                    she claims she will “never know about.”</p>

                <p>Sarmiento's unpublished poem “Jewelry” is more indignant in describing the
                    dilemma of the Halo Halo generation, as well as their lack of knowledge of
                    their Filipino culture:</p>

                <p>[B]ut they don't see the dilemma that they've put me in.<br/>
                    I'm in a push and a pull between my cultural identity.<br/>
                    My mom always said that I was born and raised on Guam,<br/>
                    but I'm really from the Philippines.<br/>
                    I guess that means I'm supposed to be<br/>
                    part FOB<br/>
                    and part almost-chaud.<br/>
                    ...<br/>
                    I was born full Filipino,<br/>
                    but now I'm half American Colonized.<br/>
                    I can't be proud of my heritage!<br/>
                    I know virtually nothing about the first half of it!<br/>
                    and the second half?!<br/>
                    I know so much about that sometimes I'm ashamed of it.<br/>
                    I know exactly what it means to be American Colonized.</p>

                <p>Sarmiento accuses colonialism of building the borders that divide him into many
                    parts. While he is expected to be a “FOB,” a “Fresh Off the Boat,” newly immigrated
                    Filipino, he feels he is not. Instead, he identifies as “part almost-chaud,” aligning
                    himself more with CHamoru culture but acknowledging that he is only “part,”
                    not fully, and “almost,” but not yet. Sarmiento's nuanced use of the word “chaud”
                    aligns with Robert Underwood's (2017) description in “Underwood: At the Edge of
                    Chamoru and English,” referencing CHamoru people suffering from language loss
                    and who are of a particular generation and social class. The term is often stigma-
                    tized and used disparagingly in Guam and the CNMI. Similarly, Sarmiento blames
                    his dilemma of cultural identity on the previous generation, but acknowledges that
                    they were unaware of the circumstances they put him in.¹²</p>

                <p>A prominent divisive factor in Sarmiento's poem, as well as in my narrative, is the
                    inability to speak the Tagalog language. Within the Filipino community of Guam,
                    there is a broad, rigorously guarded border between those who speak Tagalog and
                    those who do not. This is possibly intensified by the CHamoru language revital-
                    ization efforts, such as CHamoru language instruction in the Guam Department
                    of Education curriculum, which emphasize the importance of language for the
                    perpetuation of culture. Many young Filipino Americans regret that they were
                    not taught to speak or understand any Philippine language and surmise that they
                    may have been able to better identify with their Filipino culture and community
                    if they had been taught their Philippine language, according to Jennifer G. Osalbo
                    (2011) in her research on Filipino American identity development and its relation
                    to heritage language loss. Especially with regards to teaching the Philippine lan-
                    guage, previous generations were often reluctant to pass on Filipino culture and
                    values to children and grandchildren, often citing busy work schedules, fear of
                    discrimination, and hopes of upward social mobility through greater English profi-
                    ciency. The result is a new generation of Filipino Americans who are disconnected
                    from their language, creating the largest divide between themselves and Filipino
                    culture.¹³ The American colonialism that negatively impacted the previous genera-
                    tions unfortunately continues to affect the successful adaptation and development
                    of Filipinos in Guam into the succeeding generations. The Halo Halo generation</p>

                <p>depends on the previous generations to orient them towards Filipino cultural
                    values and to help them establish a place for themselves within the Filipino com-
                    munity. There is a discernible sense of searching for that which remains unknown
                    to the Halo Halo generation. Though all but invisible in the mix of bright colors
                    in <em>halo halo</em>, it is still there—the roots of <em>halayang ube</em>—giving the <em>halo halo</em> the
                    distinctive flavor of earth, of grounding.</p>

                <p><strong>“White” Milk and Young “Coconut”</strong><br/>
                    In <em>Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation</em>, Portes and Rumbaut
                    (2001) find that by the third generation, ethnic ties and identities have weakened
                    to the point of nonexistence as immigrant groups become fully integrated into the
                    American mainstream. By the time the grandchildren of Filipino immigrants come
                    of age, their severance from the homeland is complete. They have the highest com-
                    posite assimilation index ranking on a 100-point scale among immigrant groups in
                    the United States: 100 in economic assimilation, 72 in cultural assimilation, and 65
                    in civic assimilation, according to a comprehensive report by Jacob L. Vigdor (2008)
                    of the Manhattan Institute. Nevertheless, despite the whole-hearted embrace of as-
                    similation, a longing for what was never known remains.</p>

                <p>In “Alone,” a song I composed¹⁴ in 2011 for “The Navigator,” a musical digital sto-
                    rybook for use in a multicultural classroom, I express feelings of alienation and
                    drifting away from origins:</p>

                <p>How did I get here?<br/>
                    It's still a ways to go.<br/>
                    The distance is even harder<br/>
                    When you're out on your own.<br/>
                    The stars remain silent<br/>
                    And as they shine down on me,<br/>
                    I can't even tell if I'm where<br/>
                    I'm supposed to be.<br/>
                    So I cry out to the sky<br/>
                    And ask it, “Why?”<br/>
                    How much more have I to go<br/>
                    As I drift further<br/>
                    Far from home?<br/>
                    I am sick and tired<br/>
                    Of being tossed and blown!<br/>
                    But most of all,<br/>
                    I can't take<br/>
                    Feeling so alone.</p>

                <p>Pondering where I am, how I got there, and how much further I have to go produces
                    the feelings of loss and disillusionment experienced by the Halo Halo generation
                    subsumed in American culture. Moreover, as the descendants of immigrants to
                    Guam, the Halo Halo generation can also feel alienated by their ancestry from some
                    other place than the island they call home. Separated from Filipino culture and
                    nested within another colonized culture, the “distance” of growing up and develop-
                    ing a sense of self is even more difficult in isolation and without a point of reference.
                    Displaced, ironically despite having a physical home, and disempowered, despite
                    standing in their new communities, the Halo Halo generation may feel “tossed
                    and blown,” unable to fully ground their identities or find complete belonging in
                    Filipino, Guamanian, or American culture.</p>

                <p>Metaphor continues to be helpful in understanding the complexities of the Halo
                    Halo generation identity. In her interviews with Filipino American youth, Osalbo
                    (2011) finds that a common symbol for the “Americanized” Filipino is a coconut—
                    brown on the outside, white on the inside. This symbol is particularly applicable to
                    the Guam context, as it is a local fruit that is also a common ingredient in the <em>halo
                    halo</em> dessert. Filipinos on Guam are “coconuts” in a different sense. Just as the coco-
                    nut is also a seed, the Halo Halo generation has been planted and grown on Guam.
                    Like mature coconuts, members of the Halo Halo generation come to maturation
                    in Guam as “brown” locals, but their insides are white—inevitably marked by the
                    legacies of American colonialism.</p>

                <p>In his integral text on contemporary colonial mentality, <em>Brown Skin, White Minds:
                    Filipino -/ American Postcolonial Psychology</em>, E. J. R. David (2013) vividly recounts the
                    moment in his adolescence that provoked questions about his ethnic and cultur-
                    al identity: finding “SELL-OUT! COCONUT! YOU'RE FILIPINO, ACT LIKE IT!”
                    written on his school locker (p. xvii).¹⁵ Such a lack of congruence between one's</p>

                <p>internal and external ethnic belonging could result in psychological tension over
                    one's sense of self, as suggested by Lisa Kiang and David Takeuchi (2009) in their
                    study of Filipino Americans. Through their narratives, the Halo Halo generation
                    attempts to find words for this incongruence.</p>

                <p>In “Tools,” Zafra's (2015) recognition of her white, smooth tools in contrast
                    to the worn, stained tools of her relatives attests to the internalizing of her
                    “whitewashed” designation:</p>

                <p>I looked on in awe<br/>
                    Before looking down<br/>
                    At my own tools:<br/>
                    Smooth, white,<br/>
                    And in that moment,<br/>
                    I realized,<br/>
                    Dumb.<br/>
                    They were hands that did not know.</p>

                <p>She is in awe of the tools of her relatives that have been burnished by trials and
                    experience. She finds her tools inadequate, as they are uninitiated, under-uti-
                    lized, and essentially “dumb.” Her hands are rendered useless, unaccustomed to
                    the work before her.</p>

                <p>While Zafra genuinely describes her difference from her ancestors, Sarmiento (2012)
                    explicitly condemns the inauthentic way many young Filipino Americans attempt
                    to portray themselves in his poem, “Just a Rant”:</p>

                <p>Brown boys got pale hoes<br/>
                    white washed<br/>
                    like French toast<br/>
                    with milk mixed by Foremost.<br/>
                    ........................<br/>
                    A bunch of island kids<br/>
                    pretendin' that they ghetto<br/>
                    talkin' like they gangbangers<br/>
                    cause they can't talk Filipino.</p>

                <p>Sarmiento (2012) sarcastically describes the “brown boys” preferring “white washed,”
                    “pale hoes,” symbolizing Filipino youth being seduced by the allure of White
                    American society. The “milk mixed by Foremost” is Sarmiento's (2012) contextualiz-
                    ing of this claim, as Foremost Foods Guam Inc. produces and distributes commercial
                    fruit and dairy products to the island. The milk being “mixed” signifies that it is pro-
                    cessed and inorganic, suggesting that the promises and allure of White society are
                    similarly artificial and empty. Sarmiento later derides the tendency of Filipino youth
                    to pretend to be who they are not, in an attempt to compensate for not knowing or
                    not wanting to admit to who they are. Sarmiento confronts the superficial desire of
                    the Halo Halo generation to hide and denigrate their Filipino culture and regard the
                    norms and culture of White America as superior. Sarmiento's poem scrutinizes colo-
                    nial mentality at work in his friends and peers in the Halo Halo generation.</p>

                <p>The previous narratives display the various forms of colonial mentality (CM). David
                    (2013) conceptualizes CM as being “characterized by a perception of ethnic or cul-
                    tural inferiority that is … a specific consequence of centuries of colonization under
                    Spain and the US” and “involves an automatic and uncritical preference for anything
                    American” (p. 241).¹⁶ CM entails associating superiority, pleasantness, or desirability
                    with the physical characteristics (i.e. whiteness) and cultural characteristics consid-
                    ered American or Western (David, 2013). Based on a large national sample of Filipino
                    Americans, David (2012) finds that one out of three Filipino Americans has some
                    form of CM, resulting in lower personal self-esteem and higher depression levels.
                    The Halo Halo generation's negative experiences in their ethnic identity formation
                    can thus be greatly attributed to the prevalence of CM.¹⁷</p>

                <p>A colonial mentality prevails among the Halo Halo generation, despite living in a
                    society as culturally diverse as Guam. This attests to the lasting effects of Western co-
                    lonialism in the lives of Filipinos, CHamorus, and the other ethnic groups in Guam.
                    American and Western cultural norms continue to pervade the lives of the Halo
                    Halo generation and affect their emotional, social, and psychological development.
                    Nevertheless, with the changing socio-political landscape, Filipino Americans of
                    the later generations are adapting to an increasingly diverse society. The Halo Halo
                    generation engages in active adoptions, adaptations, and contestations of the dif-
                    ferent cultures they encounter and, as a result, dynamic identity enunciation and
                    expression take place. While being “coconuts” appears to be a general trend in the
                    narratives of the Halo Halo generation, young Filipinos in Guam are recognizing
                    their CM, are actively resisting it, and are forming coalitions with others affected by
                    American colonialism.</p>

                <p>A recent example of the Halo Halo generation fighting against CM for themselves
                    and others is through the Filipino Revolutionary History Teach-In that took place
                    on July 20, 2017 at the University of Guam. The “teach-in” was one of the monthly
                    sessions conducted by Independent Guåhan, a taskforce that provides education
                    on CHamoru self-determination and advocates for Guam's political independence.
                    Kristin Oberiano (2017), whose grandfather came to Guam through Camp Roxas,</p>

                <p>explained to <em>The Guam Daily Post</em> that<br/>
                    andemsp;As Filipinos living on Guam, we need to acknowledge that the fight for CHamoru<br/>
                    andemsp;self-determination is a fight for the ideals of self-governance, sovereignty and<br/>
                    andemsp;freedom – the same principles that led to the establishment of the Philippines,<br/>
                    andemsp;the USA, and other independent countries around the world.</p>

                <p>Oberiano and co-presenters Josephine Ong, Jamela Santos, and Ruzelle Almonds
                    are all Filipinas who consider Guam home and hope to begin dialogue with fellow
                    Filipinos in Guam to stand in solidarity with the CHamoru people by supporting
                    the CHamoru self-determination movement (Oberiano, 2017). By presenting in-
                    formation on Philippine revolutionary history, Philippine migration history, and
                    CHamoru self-determination movements, Oberiano, Ong, Santos, and Almonds
                    hope that for Filipinos in Guam, understanding their own history of independence
                    will increase the Filipino community's support for the CHamoru self-determina-
                    tion movement and will encourage other communities of non-CHamorus to do the
                    same. In this way, the Halo Halo generation develops ethnic and cultural identities
                    that transcend negative self-representations.</p>

                <p>In Guam, the members of the Halo Halo generation are developing their identi-
                    ties alongside the identity politics and cultural revitalization efforts of the local
                    CHamoru people. While the erosion of ethnic identity usually takes place in the
                    course of three generations, the assimilability of the third generation must be
                    considered within a more complex, post-civil rights context characterized by an
                    increasingly non-European composition, identity politics, and ethnic revivals
                    (Rumbaut andamp; Portes, 2001). By coming together to understand how their identities
                    are affected by American colonialism in Guam and the Philippines, the Halo Halo
                    generation can counteract feelings of unbelonging and disconnectedness. Kiang and
                    Takeuchi (2009) emphasize the importance of revisioning the Filipino American self
                    in order to moderate the negative effects of perceived discrimination by contributing
                    to a sense of group belonging, social support, and connectedness. A strong ethnic
                    identity enables the Halo Halo generation to participate more fully in the commu-
                    nity. The Halo Halo generation can be equipped to redefine themselves ethnically
                    and culturally to enhance their confidence and gain self-worth. This can be done by
                    creating spaces of agency—past, present, and in-between.</p>

                <p><strong>The Fluidity of Halo Halo</strong><br/>
                    Diasporic spaces are places, as sociologist Peggy Levitt (2009) asserts, where norms
                    are constantly renegotiated across borders and the lines between home and host
                    cultures and between the generations become blurred, making them one intercon-
                    nected social experience. These diasporic spaces, as Espiritu (2003) argues, are the
                    “space between,” a transnational space that productively articulates the tensions, ir-
                    resolutions, and contradictions that underscore the multiplicity of Filipino lives and
                    work against definitions that would fix them in one identity or place (p. 10). Living
                    between old and new, between homes, between cultures, and between languages,
                    the Halo Halo generation does not merely insert or incorporate themselves into
                    existing spaces; they instead transform these spaces with memories and histories to
                    create new ones—a “space between” (Espiritu, 2003, p. 10). When describing my own
                    identity, I claim to have internalized Guam's political status as an “unincorporated
                    territory,” finding myself in the conflictions and contradictions that this ambiguous
                    status provokes, but also emboldened to push against its limitations.</p>

                <p>Accessing the collective memory of the community, according to Leny M. Strobel's
                    (1997) study of the narratives of post-1965 Filipino Americans, brings the Halo Halo
                    generation full circle in the process of decolonization to recover what had once
                    been unknown to them:<br/>
                    andemsp;To reclaim memory at the personal level is to engage in the process of creating<br/>
                    andemsp;a collective memory of a people's history. From their memory banks, the partici-<br/>
                    andemsp;pants were able to connect their personal struggles to the struggles of the Filipino<br/>
                    andemsp;people in the Philippines, the United States, and all parts of the world … As recon-<br/>
                    andemsp;structed memories, these were imbued with new meanings for the present. (p. 73)</p>

                <p>The Halo Halo generation can compensate for a lack of cultural and historical
                    knowledge by integrating the experiences of other Filipinos into their personal
                    memories and experiences. These additional experiences become extensions of un-
                    derstanding and allow the Halo Halo generation to formulate a productive identity
                    that is able to transform and adapt to increasingly globalized contexts.</p>

                <p>Other young Filipinos of the Halo Halo generation are similarly re-membering,
                    collaging, and referencing the cultural knowledge of those in the two previous
                    generations to foreground their identity enunciations and expressions. Writing and
                    research has helped my peers and me come to terms with and give shape to our
                    experiences as descendants of our grandparents' immigration. By gaining access to
                    the experiences of Filipinos in Guam throughout the generations, the Halo Halo
                    generation feels richer and more encompassing.</p>

                <p>Personal memory must, however, be fortified by historical memory. Increased
                    awareness of Filipino culture and history enhances the identity of the Halo Halo
                    generation. The current state of the diasporic Filipino is a consequence of historical
                    facts of racism and oppression (Strobel, 1996). By reflecting on the larger political
                    and historical context of Filipino immigration and how it relates to the political and
                    historical context of Guam, the Halo Halo generation can begin the often painful
                    and emotional journey of rediscovering and reconstructing their ethnic and cultural
                    identity (Strobel, 1996), which will in turn yield acts of reclamation and activism.</p>

                <p>In addition to this autoethnographic research, one of the ways that I have attempted
                    to explore ethnic identity in the diverse context of Guam and consider the voice of
                    other Filipinos is through writing fiction. In “Departures,” my short story included
                    in the Local Voices anthology for the 2016 Festival of the Pacific, I created the char-
                    acter Lily, who goes by “Lila,” a half-Filipino, half-CHamoru island girl. Her mixed
                    identity intrigues her unnamed love interest who describes her as “worldly—or
                    other-worldly,” (p. 108) with a “passion that never stayed too latent beneath her so-
                    lemnity” (p. 110). Lila's character, however, is not simply defined by the paradoxes of
                    her identity. She navigates these seamlessly and displays tremendous agency, even-
                    tually choosing to abandon her departing love interest and stay at home, with her
                    family. She has a commitment to the island she calls home, but remains perceptive
                    of the difficulties of living there:</p>

                <p>“It's a microcosm of the feeling of living on Guam … I think it brings people
                    together when they know what they'll be missing,” she continued, “Families on
                    Guam are together all the time. And sometimes we take that togetherness for
                    granted. But when someone leaves, you're forced to remember all that you loved.
                    It just really hurts being the one here all the time.” (Espina Velasco, 2016a, p. 110)</p>

                <p>Lila is emblematic of the fluidity of the Halo Halo identity, as she makes con-
                    scious choices that display her devotion to her home and yet challenges cultural
                    expectations. She is intrigued by her White military love interest and relishes the
                    opportunity to leave home for college, but she remains tied to her family and chooses
                    not to pursue a relationship that would take her away from home. She admits that she
                    is broken, but still necessary to the ecology of “[her] ocean” (Espina Velasco, 2016a).</p>

                <p>However, balancing between the needs of the self and the expectations of the com-
                    munity is delicate. While integrating and considering the words of others, Zafra
                    cautions that there is the need to preserve the self. In “Moving Mountains,” Zafra
                    reconciles her sense of self amidst cultural expectations by claiming power in her
                    perceived weaknesses:</p>

                <p>I have walked through 23 years<br/>
                    With the same blanket of skin<br/>
                    Wrapped around my body<br/>
                    It is not tough,<br/>
                    But it is mine.<br/>
                    It knows<br/>
                    That I want nothing more<br/>
                    Than to walk into rooms unnoticed<br/>
                    To sit in far corners<br/>
                    Where I can make my quiet observations<br/>
                    Not because I am afraid,<br/>
                    But because I have been raised to believe<br/>
                    That strength does not always come wrapped<br/>
                    In perfect packaging,<br/>
                    But in tiny frameworks of dark blemishes<br/>
                    And sneaky birthmarks.</p>

                <p>While numerous voices have informed the development of her womanhood, Zafra
                    recognizes the most important voice is her own, as she makes her own identity. This
                    overtly displays the value of Western individualism. However, she also recognizes the
                    significance of the way she has been raised to overcome obstacles, alluding to the in-
                    fluence of her family. This displays the collectivism of the island culture. Her ability
                    to claim who she is despite “blemishes” and imperfections is an empowering act of
                    negotiation and resolve, based on her upbringing.</p>

                <p><strong>Re-Mixing: Conclusion</strong><br/>
                    Spaces invite fluidity. Like the smooth, fluid <em>halo halo</em> dessert, the Halo Halo genera-
                    tion has a fluid positioning, which, in the words of cultural theorist Stuart Hall (1989),
                    is not a fixed, “once-and-for-all,” but a point of identification or suture made within the
                    discourses of history and culture. Within these spaces, the social identities of Filipino,
                    Guamanian, and American collide, and the Halo Halo generation can understand
                    how these cultures comprise their sense of self and how their identities and Guam's
                    context mutually influence each other. This is a space of possibilities, re-mixing con-
                    ceptions of identity for their own particular purposes and contexts.</p>

                <p>It is what historian Howard Zinn (1984) describes as a postmodern space of identity
                    that is both multidimensional and unified, both emotional and cognitive, and both
                    individual and social, so that being oneself as a Filipino, Guamanian, and American
                    is no longer a question of authenticity, but rather being true to self in context and in
                    relationship to these different senses of self. The Halo Halo generation can experience
                    belonging and self-realization by understanding who they are as third-generation
                    Filipinos in Guam. Zinn (1984) observes that the result of re-mixing selves is an identity
                    that is different from its competing parts. The Halo Halo identity is a constant process
                    of revising who one is in relation to other Filipinos in Guam, including those within
                    and outside their own families; in relation to changing circumstances, such as Guam's
                    changing socio-political landscape; and in relation to different cultures, such as that of
                    CHamorus and other communities who call Guam home. Just as the different ingre-
                    dients undergo changes when mixed together in the <em>halo halo</em> dessert (e.g. mashing,
                    breaking apart, dissolving), the Halo Halo generation is simultaneously embedded in
                    more than one context where fluid social spaces are constantly reworked and re-mixed.</p>

                <p>In <em>Authentic Though Not Exotic: Essays on Filipino Identity</em>, Fernando N. Zialcita
                    (2005) aptly articulates the foundation of this postmodern space: “Often people
                    think in terms of ‘Either … or,' … [but] I believe it is really a case of ‘Yes … but …
                    ' Yes, to certain features of Westernization; no to others and at the same time going
                    beyond them to work out a better order” (p. 26). It is this selectivity that epitomizes
                    the Halo Halo generation's perspective. Their future depends on flexibility and
                    shifting to divergent thinking, which, according to cultural and feminist theorist
                    Gloria Anzaldúa (2001), is moving away from analytical, singular Western think-
                    ing and instead towards a holistic perspective that breaks down paradigms and
                    straddles cultures. This self rejects Western polarization, is collective and encom-
                    passing, stands in solidarity with others, and is uniquely and distinctly its own. It
                    offers an invitation: “Kumain na tayo! Let's eat!”</p>

                    <strong>Ode and Elegy to Drinking a Can of Coconut Water with My Dad in California</strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Once, I bought a can of coconut water for my dad<br/>
                    because he felt homesick for the island of our birth.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    After the first taste, he can't stop talking story<br/>
                    about the tropical past. He claims, as a barefoot<br/>
                    <br/>
                    child, he climbed tall coconut trees that touched<br/>
                    the Western Pacific sky. And he swears his grandpa<br/>
                    <br/>
                    removed the husk with his teeth and cracked the shell<br/>
                    with his knuckles. And he swears his grandma grated<br/>
                    <br/>
                    the meat with her fingernails, and squeezed it into milk<br/>
                    and oil. These products are trendy and expensive now,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I tell him, imported from plantations in Sri Lanka,<br/>
                    the Philippines, and Thailand. He laughs and says<br/>
                    <br/>
                    his great-aunties sat in a circle weaving coconut leaves,<br/>
                    and if you pressed your ear to their woven mats,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    you could still hear their gossip and singing, even after<br/>
                    they died. And because circles make memory seem less broken,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    he recalls his great-uncles, too, sat in a circle braiding<br/>
                    dried coconut fibers into rope, used to lash canoes<br/>
                    <br/>
                    and thatched houses, just as our veins bind our genealogies<br/>
                    to endure the lashing of waves and conquest. I read aloud<br/>

                    the grave, from which an unfamiliar tree sprouts.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    They watch it grow and bloom until its hard, strange<br/>
                    fruit falls and opens on impact. The girl's mother braves<br/>
                    <br/>
                    the first sip, then smiles for the first time in years,<br/>
                    as if her body, after having been completely emptied,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    is finally replenished. From that harvest, we planted<br/>
                    a sapling whenever a child was born. As generations<br/>
                    <br/>
                    passed, the trees became kin, teaching us how to bend<br/>
                    without breaking, how to create without wasting,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    and how to take without depleting. My dad tells me,<br/>
                    during his last visit home, that invasive beetles<br/>
                    <br/>
                    are devouring our coconut trees. We discard the aluminum<br/>
                    cans in the recycling bin and swallow the bitter aftertaste.

                    Before we enter the jungle, my dad<br/>
                    asks permission of the spirits who dwell<br/>
                    within. He walks slowly, with care,<br/>
                    to teach me, like his father taught him,<br/>
                    how to show respect. Then he stops<br/>
                    and closes his eyes to teach me<br/>
                    how to listen. Ekungok, as the winds<br/>
                    exhale and billow the canopy, tremble<br/>
                    the understory, and conduct the wild<br/>

                    <br/>
                    “Niyok, Lemmai, Ifit, Yoga', Nunu,” he chants<br/>
                    in a tone of reverence, calling forth the names<br/>
                    of each tree, each elder, who has provided us<br/>
                    with food and medicine, clothes and tools,<br/>
                    canoes and shelter. Like us, they grew in dark<br/>
                    wombs, sprouted from seeds, were nourished<br/>
                    by the light. Like us, they survived the storms<br/>
                    of conquest. Like us, roots anchor them to this<br/>
                    island, giving breath, giving strength to reach<br/>
                    towards the Pacific sky and blossom.<br/>

                    gratitude, and never more than what you need.”<br/>
                    He teaches me the phrase, “eminent domain,”<br/>
                    which means “theft,” means “to turn a place<br/>
                    <br/>

                    permission, they'll escort us to the site<br/>
                    so we can mark and claim what we want<br/>
                    delivered to us after removal. They say<br/>
                    this is a benevolent gesture, but why<br/>
                    does it feel like a cruel reaping?<br/>

                    <strong>Off-Island CHamorus</strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    My family migrated to California when I was 15 years old.<br/>
                    During the first day at my new high school, the homeroom<br/>
                    teacher asked me where I was from. “The Mariana Islands,”<br/>
                    I answered. He replied: “I've never heard of that place.<br/>
                    Prove it exists.” When I stepped in front of the world map<br/>
                    on the wall, it transformed into a mirror: the Pacific Ocean,<br/>
                    like my body, was split in two and flayed to the margins. I<br/>
                    found Australia, then the Philippines, then Japan. I pointed<br/>
                    to an empty space between them and said: “I'm from this<br/>
                    invisible archipelago.” Everyone laughed. And even though<br/>
                    I descend from oceanic navigators, I felt so lost, shipwrecked<br/>
                    <br/>
                    on the coast of a strange continent. “Are you a citizen?”<br/>
                    he probed. “Yes. My island, Guam, is a US territory.”<br/>
                    We attend American schools, eat American food, listen<br/>
                    to American music, watch American movies and television,<br/>
                    play American sports, learn American history, and dream<br/>
                    American dreams. “You speak English well,” he proclaimed,<br/>
                    “with almost no accent.” And isn't that what it means to be<br/>
                    a diasporic CHamoru: to feel foreign in a domestic sense.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Over the last 50 years, CHamorus have migrated to<br/>
                    escape the violent memories of war; to seek jobs, schools,<br/>
                    hospitals, adventure, and love; but most of all, we've migrated<br/>
                    for military service, deployed and stationed to bases around<br/>
                    the world. According to the 2010 census, 44,000 CHamorus<br/>
                    live in California, 15,000 in Washington, 10,000 in Texas,<br/>
                    7,000 in Hawai‘i, and 70,000 more in every other state<br/>
                    and even Puerto Rico. We are the most “geographically<br/>
                    dispersed” Pacific Islander population within the United<br/>
                    States, and off-island CHamorus now outnumber<br/>
                    our on-island kin, with generations having been born<br/>
                    away from our ancestral homelands, including my daughter.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Some of us will be able to return home for holidays, weddings,<br/>
                    and funerals; others won't be able to afford the expensive plane<br/>
                    ticket to the Western Pacific. Years and even decades might pass<br/>
                    between trips, and each visit will feel too short. We'll lose contact<br/>
                    with family and friends, and the island will continue to change<br/>
                    until it becomes unfamiliar to us. And isn't that, too, what it means<br/>
                    to be a diasporic CHamoru: to feel foreign in your own homeland.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    And there'll be times when we'll feel adrift, without itinerary<br/>
                    or destination. We'll wonder: What if we stayed? What if we return?<br/>
                    When the undertow of these questions begins pulling you<br/>
                    out to sea, remember: migration flows through our blood<br/>
                    like the aerial roots of i trongkon nunu. Remember: our ancestors<br/>
                    taught us how to carry our culture in the canoes of our bodies.<br/>
                    Remember: our people, scattered like stars, form new constellations<br/>
                    when we gather. Remember: home is not simply a house,<br/>
                    village, or island; home is an archipelago of belonging.

                    in Mongmong, Guam, circa 1980s.<br/>
                    Where's the fina'denne'? I wonder.<br/>

                    Fina'denne' (pronounced fin-ah-den-ee)<br/>
                    is the most important condiment, sauce,<br/>

                    1 part lemon/lime juice or white/coconut vinegar<br/>
                    chopped onions (white and/or green)<br/>
                    chopped donne' (red chili peppers)<br/>
                    chopped tomatoes and/or garlic (optional)<br/>
                    <br/>

                    Fina'denne' is holy water<br/>
                    at every special CHamoru event.<br/>
                    Spooned over rice, grilled meat and fish,<br/>
                    cooked vegetables, and even green salad.<br/>
                    On Guam, fina'denne' is served<br/>
                    at McDonald's and KFC.<br/>
                    It was recently featured in Saveur Magazine,<br/>

                    <br/>
                    On ordinary days, my dad<br/>
                    simply places the soy sauce<br/>
                    bottle in the middle of the table.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “Who's Kikkoman?” I once asked him.<br/>
                    In his myth-making voice, he bellows:<br/>
                    “Kikko is an ancient CHamoru chief<br/>
                    who once caught 10,000 green sea turtles<br/>
                    and stored their tears in bottles.”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “And soy,” he says. “Soy is a magic bean<br/>
                    that grows in the Far East. The turtles eat them<br/>
                    before swimming to Guam. It means, long life.”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    5<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I stare at the Kikkoman bottle and imagine<br/>
                    the Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate fighter jets<br/>
                    that bombed our island on December 8, 1941.<br/>
                    I stare at the red cap and imagine<br/>
                    the imperial rising sun of the Japanese flag,<br/>
                    how my grandparents were forced to bow<br/>
                    during those violent years of occupation,<br/>
                    how the blood of 1,000 CHamorus<br/>
                    marinated the land. Yet<br/>
                    <br/>
                    where the Greater East Asia<br/>
                    Co-Prosperity Sphere failed,<br/>

                    our stomachs continue to bow<br/>
                    to the fifth taste of “umami”<br/>
                    (pronounced oo-ma-mee),<br/>
                    and the sixth taste of empire.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    6<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now, listen to the legend of Kenji Ekuan:<br/>
                    as a child, he watched his mother pour soy sauce<br/>
                    from a half-gallon bottle into a tabletop dispenser.<br/>
                    He witnessed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.<br/>
                    His younger sister died in the explosion.<br/>
                    His father, a Buddhist monk, died from cancer.<br/>
                    Kenji traced his father's shadow and became a monk<br/>
                    at a temple in the ruined, irradiated city.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Having faced nothingness, Kenji decided to make<br/>
                    human things. He studied art, started a design company,<br/>
                    and after three years and 100 prototypes,<br/>
                    created the transparent Kikkoman bottle in 1961.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “The shape is gentle,” he once said. “During the war,<br/>
                    we were forced into acting differently. But for 1,000 years,<br/>
                    the history of the Japanese people was very gentle.”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Kenji also became famous for designing<br/>
                    motorbikes and bullet trains.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    7<br/>
                    <br/>
                    More than 300 million Kikkoman soy sauce dispensers<br/>
                    have been sold in more than 70 countries since then.<br/>
                    They infiltrate every CHamoru kitchen and table.<br/>
                    Soy sauce gently bullets through our intestines.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “Is it healthy for me to consume soy sauce every day?”<br/>
                    “Is Kikkoman soy sauce made from genetically-modified soybeans?”<br/>
                    “Are companies like Kikkoman testing on animals”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “Does sodium increase blood pressure and heart disease?”<br/>

                    I watch my dad chop the ingredients<br/>
                    and place them in an empty bowl.<br/>
                    “Pass me the ketchåp,” he says.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In CHamoru, the word for soy sauce is ketchåp,<br/>
                    which is also our word for American tomato ketchup.<br/>
                    “Same difference,” he says.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I ask him: “If soy sauce is Japanese,<br/>
                    what makes fina'denne' CHamoru?”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “It's CHamoru,” he smiles, “because<br/>
                    we made it better, we spiced it up.”<br/>
                    <br/>
                    He raises and tilts the teardrop<br/>
                    shaped bottle until it bows to us.

                    My 7th grade social studies teacher made us,<br/>
                    the children of Guam, memorize the names of<br/>
                    all 41 American presidents, whose portraits stared<br/>
                    down at us in the furthest American territory<br/>
                    from the White House. As I recited their names<br/>
                    at home, my parents watched Bill Clinton play<br/>
                    saxophone on television. “Are you voting for him?”<br/>
                    I asked. My dad, wearing his Army t-shirt, said:<br/>
                    “Didn't your teacher tell you that our votes don't<br/>
                    count. It doesn't matter that we're citizens or veterans.”<br/>

                    A few years later, my family migrated to California,<br/>
                    where I became a resident, graduated high school,<br/>
                    and registered to vote. But after Al Gore lost,<br/>
                    I learned that living in the States doesn't guarantee<br/>
                    your ballot will actually count. I learned how easy<br/>
                    it is to memorize the name of a president who wages<br/>
                    two wars and sharpens your island into a weapon.<br/>
                    And isn't that what an American president is: a name<br/>
                    to which our lands and bodies are ultimately sacrificed.<br/>

                    When Barack Obama campaigned in 2007, his name<br/>
                    gave me hope because it descended from slavery,<br/>
                    from the civil rights movement, from a mixed raced family,<br/>
                    from the Pacific. Yet Obama only visited Guam once.<br/>
                    In 2011, his plane landed at night on the air force base,<br/>
                    refueled, then departed. That's when I learned the arc<br/>
                    of history doesn't bend justice towards Guam. I learned<br/>
                    no matter what the president's name is, he remains our<br/>
                    commander, and our island remains a forgotten name.<br/>

                    For thirty years, a straw poll in Guam has accurately<br/>
                    predicted the result of US presidential elections. In 2016,<br/>
                    Hillary Clinton won the poll, yet still lost to Donald Trump,<br/>
                    thus breaking our historic (and ironic) streak. I voted for<br/>
                    neither candidate, which felt like a betrayal to my kin<br/>
                    back home, who don't have a voice in the election.<br/>
                    Some activists now petition to extend voting rights<br/>
                    to the territories; instead, I want our decolonial<br/>
                    voices to be counted, I want Guam's liberation<br/>
                    from American presidents to be inaugurated.

                    <strong>SPAM's Carbon Footprint</strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Guam is considered the SPAM® capital of the world. On average, each CHamoru<br/>
                    consumes 16 tins of SPAM each year, which is more per capita than any country<br/>
                    in the world. Headline: Guam Struggles to Find Its Roots From Beneath Growing<br/>
                    Piles of SPAM. Guam, Hawaii, and Saipan have the only McDonald's restaurants<br/>
                    that feature SPAM on the menu. I went to the “World's Largest K-Mart” in Guam and<br/>
                    I was amazed at the SPAM display … it was like a whole “Wall of SPAM.” SPAM has<br/>
                    a place not only in the stomachs of Guam's people, but in our hearts as well. Here<br/>
                    SPAM is considered a gourmet luxury and is often presented as a gift at birthdays,<br/>
                    weddings, and funerals. Hormel even made a Hot and Spicy SPAM especially for-<br/>
                    mulated for Guam with Tabasco already added to it! A culinary legacy of American<br/>
                    troops stationed in the Pacific during World War Two, the GIs noticed how much the<br/>
                    people of Guam loved SPAM, so they started to jokingly call it “CHamoru Steak.”<br/>
                    Not coincidentally, SPAM is also popular in Hawai‘i, the Philippines, Okinawa, and<br/>
                    Saipan, all places with a history of a US military presence. In fact, SPAM may have<br/>
                    been responsible for Hitler's defeat. The Allies would not have won WWII without<br/>
                    SPAM. Plus, it's processed so I guess we can keep it forever right? Wow, I haven't<br/>
                    seen this much SPAM since I lived on Guam and the car dealership there started<br/>
                    offering 50-lb bags of rice and cases of SPAM with every purchase. The end result<br/>
                    can be found in the newspaper's obituary pages. In 2004, Public Health reported<br/>
                    that heart disease was the leading cause of death in Guam, representing 33.7% of<br/>
                    deaths. You can rub the entire block of SPAM, along with the accompanying deli-<br/>
                    cious gelatinous goo, onto wood furniture. The oils from the SPAM moisturize the<br/>
                    wood and give the furniture a nice luster. Plus, you'll have enough left over to polish<br/>
                    some of your neighbors' furniture. You'll be like Santa Claus meets Mr. Clean. How<br/>
                    did I miss hearing about the “In Honor of Guam's Liberation” SPAM! I thought I<br/>
                    had collected them all! But as I got older and tried to be “healthier” (whatever that<br/>
                    means, haha), SPAM faded from my consciousness. Then I met my future wife, who<br/>
                    is Hawaiian, and SPAM became part of my life again. Maybe the economic down-<br/>
                    turn will help people truly appreciate SPAM instead of loathing it. SPAM doesn't<br/>
                    have to be unhealthy. I eat SPAM on a regular basis and I'm not dead yet. Just switch<br/>
                    to SPAM Lite. In the devastating wake of Typhoon Omar, SPAM arrived. Hormel<br/>
                    Foods donated 40,000 cases of the belly-filling foodstuff to the Salvation Army's<br/>
                    disaster relief effort. That's about six million SPAMburgers! Despite rumors, SPAM<br/>
                    is NOT made of such odds and ends as hooves, ears, brains, native people, or whole<br/>
                    baby pigs. SPAM is for realz made of pork shoulder, ham, salt, water, sugar, and<br/>
                    sodium nitrate, if you can belief it. The name itself stands for Specially Processed<br/>
                    Army Meat, Salted Pork And More, Super Pink Artificial Meat, Squirrel Possum And<br/>
                    Mouse, or Some People Are Missing. My uncle is the reigning Guam SPAM king. He<br/>
                    won the last SPAM cook-off with his Spicy SPAM meatballs. I will never forget the<br/>
                    two-pound SPAM bust of George Washington he made for Liberation Day, toasted<br/>
                    crispy on the outside with raw egg yolk in the hollow center. The kids loved it! Only a<br/>
                    fool would start a company in Guam that provides SPAM protection. We don't want<br/>
                    to be protected from SPAM bots. For Xmas, I bought a SPAM snow-globe featuring<br/>
                    a can of SPAM sitting on an island; turn it over and a typhoon swirls madly, unable<br/>
                    to unseat SPAM from its place of honor. I have a souvenir can I bought after seeing<br/>
                    Monty Python's SPAMALOT on Broadway. It cost me $10 and is the most expensive<br/>
                    SPAM I've ever bought. I will never eat it.

                    <strong>SPAM's Carbon Footprint II</strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    SPAM® was born on July 5, 1937, in Austin, Minnesota—the home of Hormel head-<br/>
                    quarters and the SPAM museum #cubistartyoucaneat. Eight pounds of SPAM die<br/>
                    in every CHamoru stomach each year, which is more per capita than any other eth-<br/>
                    no-intestinal tract in the world. Motto: “Guam is Where the Impure Pork Products<br/>
                    of America Begin!” Our guttural love of SPAM was born in 1944, when cases of the<br/>
                    shiny cans were berthed from aircraft carriers. That fateful day when my grand-<br/>
                    parents first tasted SPAM is commemorated as the Feast Day of the Immaculate<br/>
                    Consumption. St. Hormel, pray for [us]. The rest of the story is gestational genealogy,<br/>
                    a delicious cycle. Sadly, military recruiters are now worried that young CHamorus<br/>
                    have become too unhealthy and obese to enlist in the armed forces. My food phi-<br/>
                    losophy is simple: I eat therefore I SPAM. How can I prove that I'm an authentic<br/>
                    Indigenous person and not a SPAM script? At this year's Hormel SPAM Cook-Off in<br/>
                    Guam, the Polish inspired “Pika Pieirogi” ousted the “Crispy Wanton Spam Ravioli”<br/>
                    for first place. I've eaten turkey SPAM, smoke-flavored SPAM, hot and spicy SPAM,<br/>
                    garlic SPAM, SPAM lite, Portuguese Sausage flavored SPAM, and more! When did<br/>
                    our lives become so complicated and post-modern? WSFWJE? What SPAM Flavor<br/>
                    Would Jesus Eat? Come closer, closer, and I will whisper to you, in my sexy voice,<br/>
                    “google the SPAM factory's dirty little secret.” Oooohhh baby, here I am, come rub<br/>
                    up on my belly like SPAM jelly—Oooo baby here I am, come rub up on my belly like<br/>
                    SPAM jelly, Spam-Spam-Jelly, Spam-Spam Jelly! #mandatorymarley. In the morn-<br/>
                    ing, we can bring our SPAM labels to the Sorensen Media Group Offices in Hågatña,<br/>
                    and redeem 12 labels for a SPAM shirt and 9 for a SPAM hat. Guam is an acronym<br/>
                    for “Give Us American Meat.” My favorite scene in John Steinbeck's <em>The Grapes of<br/>
                    Wrath</em> (b. 1939) is when the tractor driver takes a lunch break near a tenant house<br/>
                    and eats his sandwich of white bread, pickle, cheese, and SPAM. The curious, starv-<br/>
                    ing children surround the driver, watching his hands carry the SPAM to his mouth.<br/>
                    Once upon spiral time, a CHamoru brother and sister refused to eat SPAM, so their<br/>
                    Authentic CHamoru Grandmother banished them into the diaspora and cursed<br/>
                    them to a life without meat. The vegetarian siblings migrated to Minnesota, where<br/>
                    they opened the world's first vegan butcher shop and sold meatless meats at farmers<br/>
                    markets and pop-up events. They dedicated their lives to creating the perfect vegan<br/>
                    SPAM. They tried vital wheat gluten. They tried garbanzo tapioca flour. They tried<br/>
                    peanut butter. “The flavor's good but the texture's off,” they say in unison. “SPAM is<br/>
                    just a difficult whale to catch.” If they succeed, I will never eat it.

                <head>Intersection of Identity in Three Generations of CHamoritas and Filipinas in Guam (Sharleen Santos-Bamba and Tabitha Caser Espina)</head>

                <p>Gracing Alupang Beach is a statue that epitomizes the women of Guam and their
                    rootedness in culture and home. “The Women of the Island—Three Generations”
                    statue (Figure 1) was based on a design by local CHamoru artist, Ron Castro.
                    Castro's mother, daughter, and niece posed for artwork meant to show the women
                    of Guam waiting at the shore for the men to return from fishing (R. Castro, personal
                    communication, March 2017). Later, Alupang Beach Towers commissioned Italian
                    sculptor, Roberta Giovanni, to take Castro's art and create a bronze statue to be
                    placed along the beach shore. Three generations of women, together, waiting,
                    listening, anticipating the return of their men from sea.</p>

                <p>In the same way, this chapter acts as a return. The women of the following nar-
                    ratives are together, waiting and listening not for men, but for their own voices to
                    come ashore in solidarity. CHamorus and Filipinos are historically the two largest
                    populations in Guam, at 37.3% and 26.3%, respectively (Central Intelligence Agency,
                    2017). CHamorus and Filipinos have a long, complex, and interwoven history of
                    immigration, competition, and intermingling. While most research describes this
                    interaction broadly, we turn to the voices of these women to relate the dynamics
                    and motivations of these two populations through the literate and spiritual lives of
                    CHamoru and Filipina women themselves.</p>

                <p>As a way to unpack the complex identities of CHamoru women in Guam, Dr.
                    Sharleen Santos-Bamba (2010) makes use of a trove of interviews and historical re-
                    cords to trace the literacy trajectories of three generations of CHamoru women in
                    modern Guam. Tabitha Espina Velasco (2013) uses autoethnography to explore the
                    identity formation of three generations of Filipinas in Guam. As members of both
                    these populations, we decided that an intergenerational and intercultural examina-
                    tion of our work would be productive in exploring the plurality, complexity, and
                    interrelatedness of these female identities in Guam and how they are affected by the
                    intersections of gender, race, and culture. In this chapter we examine the ways these
                    women perceive quality of life, spirituality, and cultural perpetuation in Guam.</p>

                <p>Our approach manifests CHamoru feminist scholar Laura Souder's claim in the con-
                    clusion of her seminal text, <em>Daughters of the Island: Contemporary Chamorro Women
                    Organizers on Guam</em>. Although Souder (1987) does not explicitly address CHamoru
                    and Filipina relations, she does recognize the value of comparing CHamoru women
                    with other groups in Guam (p. 237). Our partnership through our work acknowledg-
                    es a relationship between CHamoru and Filipina women in Guam that has largely
                    gone unexamined. The current era of contact between Filipinos and CHamorus
                    has deep historical roots in the advent of Western colonization. From 1521 to 1898,
                    Spain colonized Guam and the Philippines, and Guam fell under Spanish colo-
                    nial domination for more than two centuries, resulting in intermarriages between
                    CHamoru women and immigrant Filipino laborers, according to local Filipina
                    scholar Clarisa Quan (n.d.).</p>

                <p>Filipino immigrants were brought to Guam en masse after World War II as laborers
                    (Quan, n.d.). Men from Iloilo and the Visayas were recruited by construction com-
                    panies to assist in the rebuilding of Guam's infrastructure. They worked hard and
                    performed well to avoid being returned to the Philippines. The money they earned
                    as laborers was far more than what they would have earned at home. The disparity
                    in wages today is comparable to 60 years ago. In 2010, the average household income
                    in Guam was $49,263 (Guam Chamber of Commerce, n.d.), while in the Philippines
                    the average household income in 2012 was 235,000 PHP, approximately $4,643 USD
                    (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2013). For 75 years, Filipino immigrants have sought
                    greater financial opportunities in Guam.</p>

                <p>Campbell (1987) notes that Filipinos have left a major imprint on Guam's histo-
                    ry, and Quan (n.d.) affirms that some of the richness of Guam's history owes to
                    Filipinos' contributions. Filipinos have helped to build Guam's infrastructure,
                    establish local businesses, participate in local politics, and contribute to the cul-
                    ture of the community through humanitarian and service efforts, such as various
                    chapters of the Lion's Club, the Filipino Community of Guam, and the Bayanihan
                    issues within the <em>Pacific Daily News</em>.</p>

                <p>Despite their shared history, forged through the oppressions of colonialism, an-
                    imosity between Filipinos and CHamorus began with what James Perez Viernes
                    (2015) documents as “The Filipino Question” (p. 218). In 1926, Philippine Congress
                    Representative Edward Marcaido petitioned for Guam to be annexed to the
                    Philippines because of the “overlapping histories and racial similarities between the
                    CHamoru and Filipinos” (Viernes, 2015, p. 218). This provoked vehement responses
                    from CHamorus. The following are quotes from various CHamoru congressmen:</p>

                <p>“It is a well known [sic] fact that, while the people of Guam and the Filipinos
                    belong to the brown race, they do not have the same peculiarities, interests,
                    and habits … [These differences are a] very clear reason why the Filipinos and
                    Chamorros will never be friends … The Chamorro has at heart that he is a
                    better man than the Filipino.” (Viernes, 2015, pp. 220-223)</p>

                <p>Overall, congressmen asserted racial difference, and CHamoru racial superiority,
                    citing presumptions that CHamorus were more highly evolved when it came to emo-
                    tional character, spiritual faith, and philosophies of respect and good governance.
                    These perceived differences, in turn, continued to perpetuate divisiveness and com-
                    petition between CHamorus and Filipinos. Today, such divisiveness persists. So long
                    as there are ethnic, national, or religious variations in a community, there are bound
                    to be differences in ideology, epistemology, and perceptions of quality of life.</p>

                <p>In addition to this history, our own lived experiences have shown us that CHamorus
                    and Filipinos have not always gotten along. As recently as the 1960s through the
                    1980s in Guam, CHamoru-Filipino battles and street fights broke out daily—bat-
                    tles over territory and gang fights, often drawn between ethnic lines, the immigrant
                    versus the Indigenous. These differences, fortunately, have defused in recent gen-
                    erations. Much of the antagonism that had lasted almost two decades can possibly
                    be attributed to the legacy of colonialism that both groups have had to endure.
                    Increasing recognition of the ramifications of colonialism has resulted in increased
                    collaboration and cooperation.</p>

                <p>What changed this relationship in later years, however, was intermarriage.
                    CHamoru men married Filipinas, and Filipino men married CHamoritas. They had
                    children, and their bi-cultural children grew up alongside CHamoru and Filipino
                    children. Today, most CHamoru families claim Filipino family members, and most
                    Filipino families claim CHamoru family members. Campbell (1987) refers to this re-
                    lationship as “cultural consanguinity,” historically and biologically intertwined (pp.
                    3-7). The historiographies of the CHamorus and Filipinos in Guam, however, have
                    largely been documented as parallel. There is much less literature devoted to the in-
                    terconnectedness or historical relationships between CHamorus and Filipinos, and
                    there are no studies that focus specifically on the female perceptions, complexities,
                    similarities, and nuances between the generations of CHamoritas and the genera-
                    tions of Filipinas who call Guam home. To address this void, we engage together and
                    begin to share space.</p>

                <p><strong>Generations</strong><br/>
                    Santos-Bamba (2010, 2013) delineates three generations of CHamoritas in relation
                    to World War II. The first generation of CHamoritas, G1, were born before WWII
                    and experienced the hardships of war. CHamoritas of the second generation, G2,
                    were born during the postwar reconstruction period. This was a time in Guam when
                    Americanization through education and the media led to banning the use of the
                    CHamoru language and marginalizing Native culture and traditions, as a way to
                    compel CHamoru acculturation. The third generation CHamoritas, G3, were born
                    in the 1970s and 1980s and are descendants of G2 and grand-descendants of G1.
                    They attended school in Guam when English and CHamoru were both recognized
                    as official languages of Guam, hence they were not subjected to the English-only
                    policies of the early postwar period. English, more than likely, was their first lan-
                    guage in the home. While a fourth generation was not included in Santos-Bamba's
                    study, she notes anecdotally that children of G3 have expressed the significance of
                    the CHamoru language and culture in their lives, similar to their mothers' expe-
                    riences. This fourth generation makes use of CHamoru in personal and spiritual
                    domains through prayer and song. During an informal conversation with Santos-
                    Bamba, an 8-year-old said, “My grandma and mom speak to each other in Chamorro</p>

                <p>sometimes. They do that when they don't want us to understand. [Laughing] But we
                    understand what they are saying!”</p>

                <p>In her chapter, “The Halo Halo Generation: Identity Formation in the Narratives of
                    Third Generation Filipinos on Guam,” Espina Velasco (2013) describes three genera-
                    tions of Filipina women, using metaphors from Filipino desserts. Espina Velasco uses
                    the Tagalog term <em>ube</em> (purple yam) to characterize the generation of Filipinas who
                    were the initial generation in their families to emigrate to Guam from the Philippines.
                    Espina Velasco uses the term <em>sapin sapin</em>, literally “layers,” to characterize the second
                    generation of Filipinas in Guam. This generation is characterized by a “layering” and
                    hybridity within their syncretic identity. Espina Velasco terms the third generation
                    of Filipinas the <em>Halo Halo</em> generation, after the Filipino halo halo dessert, as various
                    ingredients significant in Filipino culture are subsumed and are literally “mix mixed”
                    in a white milk concoction to become indistinguishable. In the same way, this gener-
                    ation's Filipino cultural identity is dispersed among other elements.</p>

                <p><strong>Quality of Life</strong><br/>
                    CHamoru women generally are expected to hold the family together, nurture faith,
                    and protect the home. The ways they do this involve language. For G1, literacy was
                    sought for education and professional work and was not necessary for home life.
                    While English was the vehicle for academic and professional endeavors, for G1 the
                    CHamoru language was the language of the home.</p>

                <p>Having observed life within the military from their vantage “outside the fence,” and
                    seen stateside lifestyle via the media, G2 yearned for a quality of life that mirrored
                    their American counterparts. Guam swiftly moved from subsistence to a cash-based
                    economy following WWII (Santos-Bamba, 2010). G2 then entered the workforce
                    and contributed to their household finances. Some had college degrees, but most
                    did not. Because of dual household incomes, they made enough money to travel,
                    build modern homes, buy new cars, and eventually send their children to college.
                    Education and being literate in English were priorities instilled in their children
                    because it was American education and the English language that afforded oppor-
                    tunities for an elevated quality of life. In interviews, the women of G2 expressed
                    their sense that entering the workforce and contributing to their household incomes
                    provided an improved quality of life that included the comforts of modernity, travel,
                    and material goods.</p>

                <p>Born in the 1970s and 1980s, G3 was greatly influenced by their grandmothers, the
                    first generation, because their G2 mothers had entered the workforce. Most third
                    generation CHamoritas spent a significant amount of time with their grandmothers,
                    which in turn led them to embrace the traditional coupled with the modern. Some
                    examples of this include the preparation of traditional foods like <em>kadun mannok</em>,
                    faith-based practices like rosaries and novenas, and domestic duties like caring for
                    a home and family. Another prime example is the practice of showing respect when
                    greeting an elder, <em>fannginge'</em>. <em>Fannginge'</em> is the act of sniffing an elder's right hand to
                    inhale or receive their wisdom, strength, and courage (<em>ånimu</em>).</p>

                <p>The three generations of Filipinas in Guam, like their CHamoru counterparts, also
                    deployed language to improve their quality of life. The writings by and interview
                    with Espina Velasco's grandmother, Ruthie Alvarez Caser, describe her feelings
                    of alienation and disillusionment upon her initial arrival in Guam: “I cried! I was
                    trapped … I was really crying for a few days, in spite of me with my husband. Yeah.
                    I was so sad … ” (as cited in Espina Velasco, 2016, p. 87). Like the CHamoritas in G1,
                    Caser and others in the Ube generation attempt what Espina Velasco terms “(ho)
                    me-making,” the simultaneous making of both home and self, in Caser's case while
                    being a homemaker in the family. Like the CHamoritas in G1, the diary entries and
                    letters Caser wrote to Espina Velasco's great-grandmother depicted her identity for-
                    mation, but through the difficulties of immigration. Caser, like the CHamoritas in
                    G1, describes choosing family over education. Narratives from Bruce Campbell's 1987
                    survey of Filipino immigrants in Guam and from Bernadette Provido, an original
                    Camp Roxas immigrant, also portray the Ube generation's migrant identity as con-
                    stituted through a range of intersecting, competing forces and processes reconciled
                    through agency. Education, family, the impacts of World War II, and motherhood
                    were also topics that recurred. Like the CHamoritas, Filipina women have the re-
                    sponsibility of maintaining and upholding the family. Many Filipinas began to work
                    outside of the home to contribute to the livelihood of their families, and they use
                    their language to effect change outside the home, in the community.</p>

                <p>Like G2 of CHamoritas, the Sapin Sapin generation has a quality of life greatly
                    influenced by the postwar Americanization of Guam. They use their literacy and
                    familiarity with American culture to navigate among competing identities. Songs
                    and books written by Espina Velasco's mother, Alpha Caser Espina, a teacher and
                    recording artist, and other supplementary narratives by Vivian Dames, a Filipina
                    scholar-activist, and by Bernadette Schumann, producer of the film <em>Under the
                    American Sun</em>, display a paradox of assimilation, wherein assimilability is valued,
                    yet ethnic differentiation is also embraced (Espina Velasco, 2014). Their language
                    displays the intersectionality of multiple, layered identities that simultaneously
                    register oppression and privilege. While these women work outside of the home,
                    their labors are concerned with what is deeply felt inside home—trying to reconcile
                    multiple roles and expectations.</p>

                <p>No other generation is more influenced by the Americanization of Guam than
                    the third generation. The narratives of the Halo Halo generation show a fluid
                    positioning, situated between a variety of different and often competing generational,
                    ideological, and moral reference points, including those of parents, grandparents,
                    and their own real and imagined perspectives about multiple homelands. Because
                    of the ambiguity of what constitutes home for this generation, language is more
                    concerned with reclamation for personal identity, rather than the maintenance of
                    a household. Like the CHamoritas of G3, the upward social mobility enabled by
                    previous generations of Filipinas in Guam have granted the Halo Halo generation
                    the privilege of considering identity apart from livelihood. Their connection with
                    Filipino culture is further removed, as Filipino customs and traditions are often
                    combined with aspects of their American culture. However, like G3 CHamoritas,
                    many young Filipinas are taught Filipino cultural values through cooking traditional
                    dishes like <em>adobo</em> and <em>pancit</em>, fulfilling domestic duties while going to work or school,
                    and maintaining spiritual practices, mostly through the Catholic Church. Just as the
                    younger generations of CHamoritas are taught the honorific practice of <em>fannginge'</em>,
                    young Filipinas are taught to <em>beso beso</em>, or kiss the cheeks of friends and family,
                    and are taught to <em>amen</em>, showing respect by placing the hand of an elder on her
                    forehead. Kevin Nadal (2011) finds in his handbook <em>Filipino American Psychology</em> that
                    many young Filipino Americans in the US mainland have a culture that is “a hybrid
                    of indigenous and colonial values, beliefs, customs, and traditions” (p. 36), and
                    the same could be said of the young Filipino Americans in Guam. The Halo Halo
                    generation is unencumbered by the immigrant mentality of previous generations
                    and instead is diasporic in ideology and practice. For the third generations of both
                    CHamoritas and Filipinas, American media, in particular, perpetuates the process
                    of Americanization, as young people are increasingly exposed to contemporary
                    fashion trends and slang, world travel, and opportunities beyond Guam's shores.
                    While Americanization has embedded itself in island culture through media and
                    education, both Filipino and CHamoru youth maintain their cultural values, as
                    seen in their collectivist cultures. While they may behave more independently than
                    previous generations, their independence fuels their commitment to their families
                    and communities. For example, many young adults are employed and live at home.
                    Not only do they support themselves, but they also contribute to their family's well-
                    being. An added layer to this commitment is the choice that hundreds of college
                    students make to attend a higher education institution in Guam; remaining on
                    island makes obtaining a degree, contributing to household income, and fulfilling
                    familial responsibilities possible and economical—enabling young CHamoritas
                    and Filipinas to continue to aim for an increased quality of life.</p>

                <p><strong>Spirituality</strong><br/>
                    Family and faith, for most CHamoru women, are the foundations for a secure quality
                    of life. Consequently, a shared element among all three generations of CHamoritas
                    is that CHamoru language remains significant in the private and religious domains
                    via song and prayer. In interviews with G1 CHamoritas, they remarked that the
                    CHamoru language was used for spiritual and religious activities and that CHamoru
                    was the language of the home. Literacy in the Native language manifested in the
                    form of religious materials like rosary and novena prayers and songs. Among G2
                    CHamoritas as well, the utility of the CHamoru language relates directly to religious
                    activities and familial relationships. As mothers, they exposed their children to and
                    encouraged religious devotion through family prayer, songs, and worship. Family
                    togetherness and interconnectedness were nurtured and transmitted through the
                    generations and they attributed much of this family strength to their faith. In G3, the
                    CHamoritas lament the erosion of their CHamoru language, which in turn affects
                    their faith. Certain practices and traditions are expressed in CHamoru or bilingually
                    as a way to preserve the language. However, while their understanding of CHamoru
                    may be satisfactory—having been exposed to the CHamoru language by their par-
                    ents, grandparents, and extended family—they are not confident in their ability to
                    converse in the language, and they sense some loss and longing for the language of
                    their people. They also realize that CHamoru language and literacy is personal and
                    important for maintaining CHamoru culture and identity, especially through faith
                    and practice in the Catholic Church in Guam. This realization and spiritual practices
                    and beliefs are also present in the lives of the children of G3. These children—along-
                    side their parents, grandparents, and often great-grandparents—engage in activities
                    that perpetuate their cultural and religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>Similar patterns of spirituality appear among the generations of Filipinas in Guam.
                    The Ube generation used both English and Tagalog in letters and diaries to express
                    faith. For example, Caser's letters begin with exhortations to God for the family's
                    good health and happiness and often end with “God bless you!” and written prayers.
                    In the Sapin Sapin generation, faith is what motivates Espina to continue her work
                    in both music and teaching. In her scholarly work on abortion and the Catholic
                    Church, Dames (2003) contemplates the faith of Guam's people and how it plays
                    a role in access to health services. Like the CHamoritas of G3, the Halo Halo gen-
                    eration also laments an erosion of language; many can only express themselves in
                    English. Their narratives do not directly address their faith and spirituality. Their
                    disillusionment and ambivalence owe in part to being limited in the ways to connect
                    with the faith of their family and culture through Native language.</p>

                <p><strong>Cultural Perpetuation</strong><br/>
                    One distinct difference between CHamoru and Filipino women with regard to
                    identity is their sense of place. Specifically, CHamoru women are of the land, but
                    Filipino women and their descendants have a motherland other than Guam. It is
                    the difference between those who imposed and those who were imposed upon.
                    This distinction, however, is not meant to negate a relationship, but rather to help
                    make sense of the bifurcated, complex relationship between CHamoru and Filipino
                    women in Guam. The positionalities of these populations with regard to home come
                    to bear on the perpetuation of their individual cultures.</p>

                <p>For the generations of CHamoritas, identity, culture, language, and literacy in Guam
                    have been displaced by the politicization of language. The three generations of
                    CHamoru women in Santos-Bamba's study are the bearers of culture and language in
                    their respective families. They acknowledge that colonization, Americanization, and
                    modernization have influenced life and CHamoru culture in Guam, and although
                    their lives today may be quite different from their ancient CHamoru ancestors, the
                    stories of these generations of women coupled with what is documented in Guam
                    history, show that these CHamoru women embody the same values of their ancestors:
                    <em>inafa'maolek</em>, interdependence and helping one another, and <em>mamåhlao</em>, humility.</p>

                <p>For the generations of Filipinas, cultural perpetuation remains complex, subject to
                    the multiple homelands and reference points of immigration. Assimilative process-
                    es and the exigencies of moving to Guam prevented many in the Ube generation
                    from perpetuating their language and culture within the home. Many feel that ori-
                    enting their children and grandchildren toward a more American lifestyle would
                    guarantee greater social mobility. For the Sapin Sapin generation, acculturative pro-
                    cesses and being able to navigate several subject positions simultaneously enable
                    them to transmit their culture through their narratives both inside and outside the
                    home. While they see Filipino culture as important, for the immigrants and their
                    offspring, movement and migration force them to consider what is necessary to
                    bring and to pass along.</p>

                <p>Particularly for the third generation of both groups, cultural perpetuation is increas-
                    ingly constrained. The third generation of CHamoritas believe that Americanization
                    and modernization have forced the culture to evolve in positive ways, but have also
                    pushed many traditional beliefs and practices to the periphery, so much that people
                    have forgotten the meanings behind them. A prime example of forgotten meanings
                    is the CHamoru Catholic practice of rosaries for the dead. The 9 days of public
                    rosary and another 9 days of family rosaries—18 rosaries in total—is a way to show
                    respect to the deceased relative over an extended period of time. There are many
                    CHamorus who practice the 18 days of rosaries because “that's just how it has always
                    been” without questioning the meaning behind the practice. Like the CHamoritas
                    in the third generation, many in the Halo Halo generation tend not to speak any
                    Filipino language and tend to be averse to Filipino customs. This is characteristic
                    of the self-denigrating Filipino colonial mentality, described by Filipino scholars
                    E. J. R. David (2013) and Renato Constantino (1966). Espina Velasco finds that, as a
                    Filipina, claiming an island girl identity in Guam is both problematic and conten-
                    tious, as she encounters questions of authenticity and belonging as both Filipina
                    and Guamanian—identities that are seen as mutually exclusive. Along with the</p>

                <p>slam poetry of Verna Zafra, their narratives articulate the feelings of loss and disillu-
                    sionment experienced by the Halo Halo generation, subsumed in American culture
                    and unable to fully claim an “island” or even “authentic” Filipino identity.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
                    Overall, this juxtaposition of CHamorita and Filipina lives is informative because
                    both are postcolonial subjects who have experienced oppression in similar and dis-
                    similar ways, particularly in relation to language. By presenting Guam subjects as
                    similar, yet distinct, we hope to increase solidarity and furthermore, to claim that
                    the only way to counteract the effects of colonialism is through unity. This is ad-
                    mittedly a beginning work but one that we hope will begin the sharing of space
                    between CHamoritas and Filipinas.</p>

                <p>Our shared motivations in our individual research projects were the starting point
                    for our collaboration. We both desire for our communities to share their identities
                    on their own terms—with their own authority—in their own languages, as we ex-
                    plore how CHamorita and Filipina grandmothers, mothers, and daughters all share
                    a sense of connectedness and express “women's ways of knowing” (Santos-Bamba,
                    2010, p. 58). For both CHamoritas and Filipinas, faith is significant in the mainte-
                    nance of language, culture, and community, and each of our studies emphasizes the
                    significance of intergenerational transmission of culture and language. CHamoritas
                    and Filipinas lament the loss of language through generations, even though they
                    recognize their own responsibility for the loss. The similarities between these pop-
                    ulations in Guam are too significant to ignore.</p>

                <p>In launching this research, we hope to increase understanding of the ways language,
                    literacy, and identity in Guam have been and continue to be politicized as a result
                    of Guam's colonial history and its ambiguous political relationship with the United
                    States. Guam's language and culture have been directly influenced by colonialism,
                    Westernization, modernization, migration and integration of peoples, and the glo-
                    balization of English, and these influences can be seen in the ways that these women
                    use language for empowerment, faith, and family.</p>

                <p>We hope that another implication will be increased collaboration between these
                    communities in Guam, which Teresia Teaiwa (1994) refers to as “s/pacific n/oceans
                    [that] honor the specificities of Islander experience, recognize the generic effects of
                    (neo)colonialism on all Islanders, and are committed to political and cultural coop-
                    eration at the regional level” (p. 102). Ultimately, the act of combining and analyzing
                    these two scholarly works together speaks to the need for increased collaboration
                    between CHamoritas and Filipinas in contemporary generations. Furthermore, it
                    confronts and counteracts historical perceptions of competition and animosity and
                    works within the complex relationship of cultural consanguinity.</p>

                <p>As a CHamorita scholar and a Filipina scholar, we stand alongside the women of these
                    generations, resting upon their shoulders, like the female figures in “The Women of
                    the Island—Three Generations” statue. We add our voices to theirs. Additionally,
                    as a CHamorita scholar and a Filipina scholar, we stand alongside one another, at-
                    testing to the community of Guam that is formed by these two populations. Like the
                    statue, we stand firm on the foundations of the women who came before us. At the
                    same time, generations together, cultures together, we remain forged, resolute, and
                    immovable. We look on, toward the ocean, toward new horizons.</p>

                <head>Bridging Cultures (Mary Therese Perez Hattori)</head>

                <p>The word home immediately evokes thoughts of Guam though I have lived away
                    from home for over three decades. In this article, I will share some challenges that
                    we who move away from home face, and some strategies for surmounting those
                    challenges without relinquishing cultural identity and values.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges faced when first living away is homesickness, indicat-
                    ed by the frequent use of the word <em>mahålang</em> (yearn, desire, lonely) and its variants
                    by CHamorus who live away from home. The world of social media is replete with
                    instances or variants of the word as a theme, hashtag, keyword, and comment posted
                    by CHamorus who live away from the islands. One's well-being is negatively im-
                    pacted by the separation from one's homeland. Expressions of <em>mahålang</em> are often
                    posted in response to photos, stories, news, events, and even recipes about our home
                    islands in social spaces such as Pinterest, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, and blogs.
                    For those who no longer live in the islands, these images evoke feelings of yearning,
                    expressed in the comment, “<em>Mahålang yu'</em>.” Those from other Micronesian islands
                    have similar expressions—<em>pwos</em> (Chuukese/Carolinian), <em>ngachalong</em> (Ulithian),
                    <em>ōn</em> (Marshallese). I have not observed such a strong and consistent response by
                    American social media consumers who have moved away from their home states.</p>

                <p>Even though we move away from the Marianas and call our new spaces “home,”
                    for many of us, there will always be a deeply felt yearning for our ancestral lands.
                    The deep sense of <em>i minahalang</em> can be softened by sustaining my CHamoru cus-
                    toms and values, and connecting to others. The pain of longing for home is eased
                    by belonging to various groups; one can mitigate those intense feelings of longing
                    that impede wholeness and affect well-being by finding spaces of belonging. I have
                    sought affiliation with communities that embody what Kawagley and Barnhardt
                    (n.d.) describe as groups that “have a remarkable capacity to open themselves up
                    and draw people into their lives.” I've made connections to Native scholars from
                    other Pacific islands, to advocacy groups who serve Micronesians in Hawai‘i, and
                    to Indigenous-serving educational institutions that seek new perspectives as they
                    expand and improve services for students from Micronesia.</p>

                <p>I am aware that in many interactions with others, I may be one of the few CHamorus
                    the other people might meet. Due to the human tendency to generalize, the other
                    person may assume that anything I say or do, any impressions or emotions I might
                    evoke, may then be generalized to all CHamoru people. To help people understand
                    that I am a member of, but not a paragon of an entire people and culture, I often
                    begin my talks with a statement like, “I can only speak from my own personal per-
                    spective at this time and cannot speak for all CHamoru people, all Pacific Islanders,
                    or all Indigenous people.”</p>

                <p>This cognizance of generalization carries a sense of responsibility for being an
                    exemplary representative of our people, a responsibility that sometimes seems a
                    burden. It is a factor that influences my public behavior and anything I produce.
                    CHamoru society is communal in nature, in contrast to the individualistic society
                    of the United States. This contrast is highlighted by the way personal introductions
                    are made in social and professional encounters and by the communal designations
                    used to refer to individuals. CHamorus introduce themselves by clan, village, and
                    family names before using personal names. Throughout my childhood, I was often
                    referred to by my surname and since I am a twin, was often simply called “<em>dinga</em>”
                    (CHamoru for “twin, double, fork of a road or tree branch”). Personal introductions
                    in social settings rarely involved the use of my first name. Another designation is
                    <em>hagan Guåhan</em>, daughter of Guam (literally “blood of Guam”); this encourages a
                    sense of being a representative of the island and her people.</p>

                <p>When I conduct research, write a paper, or deliver a speech, there is an accountability
                    to others, a sense that I am crafting this work not only for myself, but for my family
                    and people. Professional endeavors are not undertaken for my own benefit, but for the
                    good of our community. In contrast, peers from the United States have the freedom to
                    perform these same acts as individuals, with no care or expectation of representing
                    their home states, other American people, or American culture in general.</p>

                <p>Despite any feeling of burden, there are empowering possibilities in being a represen-
                    tative of our culture. For the last 4 years, I have served alongside other Micronesians
                    as cultural consultants guiding the Honolulu Museum of Art's planning of an annual
                    Celebrate Micronesia Festival. Informed by members of the region, the festival is
                    an authentic representation of contemporary culture from the perspective of Native
                    peoples of the region. Another strategy for sustaining my CHamoru identity while
                    living away has been a process of reflection, articulation, and application. Living in
                    a foreign place forces me to reflect on my own identity. Academic studies have given
                    me the ability to articulate CHamoru ways of being, ways of knowing, and values.
                    I engage in what Dr. Michael Perez (2016) calls “academic sovereignty,” wherein I
                    employ and appropriate the language and tools of academia to assert my CHamoru
                    identity and shine a positive light on our culture. I have used Western principles
                    such as Authentic Leadership, Temporal Intelligence, and Culturally Sustaining
                    Education to construct conceptual bridges, pathways to understanding so that so-
                    phisticated CHamoru ideas are accessible to people from mainstream America. I
                    apply CHamoru ways to my professional practices of teaching, research, and lead-
                    ership. Applying the ethos of <em>inafa'maolek</em> in my leadership practice, I prioritize
                    relationships and communal identity by employing community-building activities,
                    establishing teams, and mentoring relationships to foster collaboration rather than
                    competition and cultivate feelings of belonging. My leadership philosophy reflects
                    a posture of stewardship, “the attitude that I am a custodian of the university's re-
                    sources, be they material, financial, or human. I strive for equitable distribution of
                    assets and sustainability of efforts, mindful that present-day decisions and actions
                    will impact future generations” (Hattori, 2016a, p. 5).</p>

                <p>Creative endeavors such as poetry and photography allow me to communicate the
                    esoteric, spiritual aspects of our culture in ways that resonate with other people,
                    thus building bridges between our cultures. As an example, I share a poem which
                    illustrates a CHamoru sensibility regarding spiritual connections to our elders:</p>

                <p><strong>i piluña (the feather)</strong><br/><br/>
                    From a still and empty sky<br/>
                    a lone feather emerges<br/>
                    the down of a bird<br/>
                    descends gradually<br/>
                    gently<br/>
                    slowly<br/>
                    <br/>
                    it floats<br/>
                    down<br/>
                    down<br/>
                    down<br/>
                    <br/>
                    alighting onto my outstretched palm<br/>
                    <br/>
                    a soft sweet kiss<br/>
                    from the <em>aniti</em><br/>
                    a powerful portent<br/>
                    a message<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <em>maolek</em>......good<br/>
                    <em>todu maolek</em>.....all is well<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Perhaps my <em>tåta</em>, now a <em>taotaomo'na</em><br/>
                    always a <em>pikaru</em><br/>
                    plucked it from a passing bird<br/>
                    and sent it as a gift<br/>
                    a feather drifting on the susurration of <em>saina</em><br/>
                    the whispers of wise elders. (Hattori, 2016b, p. 53)</p>

                <p>Creative expression has been an important aspect of the lives of other CHamoru
                    academics and artists who have lived for a time away from the Marianas. The poetry
                    written during this phase in their lives acts as bridges, connecting them to homeland,
                    to the Indigenous people of their temporary homes, and to subsequent generations
                    of CHamoru who have spent part of their lives away from home. Examples are the
                    poetry of my contemporaries Cecelia Lee Perez and Anne Perez Hattori, the work of
                    younger poets such as Kisha Borja-Quichocho, Anghet Hoppe-Cruz, Craig Santos
                    Perez, and emerging Matao/Ilokano artist Dåkot-ta Alcantara-Camacho (2017), who
                    includes a reference to “<em>i piluña</em>” in his song, <em>Fangguålo'</em>, excerpted here:</p>

                <p>if we don't do the work to clear up all the hurt<br/>
                    we just pass it on to our children who really don't deserve<br/>
                    more excuses for the nooses we tie around our selves<br/>
                    the truth is we can do this our ancestors here to help<br/>
                    i can hear them crying out people tell me they have seen<br/>
                    spirits in the form of feathers and grandma's chanting in dreams<br/>
                    i know this is their message asking us to just believe<br/>
                    but I am not a priest and definitely not here to preach<br/>
                    just trying to craft a medicine to set our people free</p>

                <p>It seems that many of us who live away from our home islands engage in this pro-
                    cess of reflection, articulation, and application of CHamoru ways, finding our own
                    paths to authentic lives that honor our heritage. By identifying and sharing the best
                    aspects of our culture, we can be agents of positive change in this world, wherever
                    we are, simply by being who we are.</p>

                <head>Discovering Saipan Community Art Values (Angelyn Labadan)</head>

                <p>Having been interested in art from a young age, I often found myself taking art class-
                    es and getting involved in as many art activities as I could. From elementary to high
                    school, and to the present day, I crave to satisfy my creative passions through making
                    crafts at home, creating works in the studio, participating in various art contests,
                    visiting exhibitions and galleries, and much more. However, during high school and
                    my early university years, I soon realized that the number of art activities, promo-
                    tions, and funding for such in the CNMI was limited or unavailable due to federal
                    funding blocks. This realization sparked an interest to uncover the reason for this
                    issue and to identify the benefits that art could provide for the CNMI community (if
                    and when the blocks are lifted).</p>

                <p>There are often many questions asked about art. Is there a right or wrong in art? Is
                    there a real value to art? However, perhaps the most apt question for the CNMI is,
                    “Where is the art?” Are the arts in the CNMI fading due to lack of support and value?
                    These questions form the basis for the primary inquiry of this chapter: “What is
                    the value of art in the Saipan community?” The arts have played a major part in
                    our history, such as documenting events before the written word, and are proven to
                    have positive intrinsic and instrumental cognitive benefits. Despite this, there is a
                    noticeable lack of artistic outlets and production in the Saipan art community. Thus,
                    the study reported here is a prompt for future research to further increase art en-
                    gagement, art promotion, and creative projects such as public murals, art galleries,
                    or art institutions within the Northern Marianas community.</p>

                <p>Art has value beyond merely aesthetic creation. Much literature has served to es-
                    tablish “benefits of the arts” that range from educational benefits like enhanced
                    creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, to socio-emotional benefits
                    such as positive impacts on one's social skills, and growth in areas of independence
                    and cognition. Exemplars of such literature include the book <em>Arts with the Brain in
                    Mind</em> by Eric Jensen (2001) and the <em>Cultural Trends</em> journal article entitled “Measuring
                    the Intrinsic Benefits of Art Attendance” by Jennifer Radbourne, Hilary Glow, and
                    Katya Johanson (2010). In <em>Arts with the Brain in Mind</em>, Jensen (2001) states, “the visual
                    arts are an important part of brain-based education. They can enhance cognition,
                    emotional expression, perception, cultural awareness, and aesthetics; they can play
                    a significant role in the learning process” (p. 49). Likewise, numerous secondary
                    sources, ranging from newspaper articles, magazines, journals, and blogs from art-
                    ists all over the world and in Saipan, highlight the benefits of the arts. Although
                    there is much literature and research advocating the arts, there are indications in
                    Saipan that the value of art is not as well accepted as elsewhere. In many cases the
                    arts are viewed as optional or unnecessary. This perceived low value has resulted in
                    budget cuts in both school art programs and community art programs. Budget cuts
                    are mainly evident in public schools—which emphasize core subjects like math,
                    reading, and writing—and in communities where social issues like governmental
                    assistance are of higher priority. In light of these circumstances, this research ex-
                    plores the importance and value of the arts in the Saipan community.</p>

                <p><strong>The Psychological and Educational Value of the Arts</strong><br/>
                    Blum's 2011 study of the psychological birth of art states, “Prehistoric cave art was
                    created many thousands of years before the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge.
                    Later, written language appeared, long after spoken language and derived from pic-
                    torial script such as, hieroglyphics” (p. 197). This means that art was present before
                    humans developed into the “dominant” species but served as a useful tool for evolv-
                    ing humans. Evidence also shows the use of art at burial sites of ancestors and as an
                    expression of emotion and display of culture. Art still serves these purposes, but has
                    become even more vital as studies show how art can enhance brain functions as well.</p>

                <p>The value of arts in education has been an ongoing debate in recent years and still
                    sparks arguments today. Despite many scientific studies advocating the implemen-
                    tation of arts in education, there are many other critical issues to consider, such
                    as funding and assessment. In <em>Arts with the Brain in Mind</em>, Jensen (2001) states that
                    “the visual arts are an important brain-based education … and can enhance cog-
                    nition, emotional expression, perception, cultural awareness … [The visual arts]
                    play a significant role in the learning process” (p. 49). An article entitled “Does Arts
                    Education Develop School Readiness” (Nevanen et al., 2014), reports on a study con-
                    ducted in Finland that measured the implementation of art programs in day care
                    centers and schools. The results showed “that the program motivated children and
                    aroused their interest in thinking, problem-solving, practicing, and learning” (p. 71).
                    Similarly, other studies also advocate for greater inclusion of arts in the educational
                    curriculum or further endorse art programs for increased intrinsic and instrumen-
                    tal benefits. Eisner (2008), in his commentary “What Education Can Learn from the
                    Arts,” states, “The recognition of the demands and the contributions that the arts
                    make is of fundamental importance in justifying the place of the arts in our schools,
                    that is, as being central, rather than educational accomplishments” (p. 23). Jensen's
                    (2001) research on the arts in education reveals positive test score correlations and
                    asserts that “the College Board says that the arts are vital … and knows the value
                    of the arts” (p. 60).</p>

                <p>Despite strong support for increased art inclusion in education, other research
                    and observation show a fair number of schools cutting art programs due to lack
                    of funding, lack of understanding, and confusion in relation to the value of art. An
                    article from the National Federation of State High Schools (2013) states, “When
                    cutting programs, superintendents strive to cut those that have the least impact to
                    learning and that create the least amount of controversy. Wrongly, superintendents
                    often recommend cutting some of the fine arts programs” (para. 2). There are also
                    questions that continue to baffle some educators in regard to how the arts should
                    be assessed. If art is subjective and there is no right or wrong, then how will it be</p>

                <p>assessed? And, if art does have intrinsic and instrumental benefits, how can these
                    benefits be measured in the classroom? In his book, Jensen (2001) asserts that art
                    can be assessed with three concepts: knowledge/content of art, responses to art, and
                    performance-related questions. Although the concepts of art assessment are still
                    being explored, studies of art and its effects not only on education but on the brain
                    can be said to be proliferating.</p>

                <p>With regard to the current standing of the arts, arts partnerships, and funding in
                    the CNMI, the most relevant information can be found in the local newspapers, in
                    particular the <em>Marianas Variety</em>. While the newspaper has recorded the blocks on
                    funding from 2005-2018, one of its articles entitled “NEA Reinstates Arts Council's
                    Eligibility to Apply for Federal Grants,” indicates that the council is once again able
                    to apply for funding and is determined to properly manage funds if they are granted
                    (Lirio, 2018). As of October 2021, Arts Council Executive Director Parker Y. Yobei
                    (personal communication, September 29, 2021) stated via email that<br/><br/>
                    andemsp;The annual partnership [grant] with NEA was reinstated back in 2018. [However]<br/>
                    andemsp;During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we administered the grant from<br/>
                    andemsp;NEA towards recovery from Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu, in<br/>
                    andemsp;which community [art] projects like murals on gyms and power poles took place.</p>

                <p><strong>Surveying the Community</strong><br/>
                    Two distinct surveys were developed, piloted, and distributed—one for the general
                    public (see Appendix A) and one for professional artists (see Appendix B)—to help
                    analyze the state of the arts in the Saipan community. Additionally, short interviews
                    were conducted with children regarding their perceptions of the arts. The interview
                    questions (see Appendix C) were based on the questions from the general survey,
                    but appropriately revised for the children's ease of comprehension. Interviews
                    were conducted with 10 children. The surveys were distributed both electronically
                    and manually. The general survey garnered 29 respondents while the artist survey
                    garnered 11 respondents, many of whom were manually acquired at a local artists'
                    market. All surveys were open for about a month. The surveys and interviews gar-
                    nered responses from varying age groups (Figure 1). Responses were unique and
                    provided useful expressions of the Saipan community's views on the value of art.</p>

                <p>All professional artists held a similar view on the value of art, despite the varying
                    years and experiences in their professional careers. As a general consensus, artists
                    reported that the arts hold major importance in generating creativity and express-
                    ing oneself, as well as art being a key instrument in what makes people human.
                    Participant #1 highlighted the importance of art in education:</p>

                <p>While some are quick to dismiss the importance of art in school curriculum,
                    art is just as important as any of the core subjects because art, any form of art,
                    promotes freedom of expression, creativity, ingenuity, and critical thinking—all
                    of which are vital in the pursuit of innovation and human development.</p>

                <p>Participant #2 encouraged both the community and artists to play an active role in
                    the social art network: “A place where artists can perform together and have some
                    great time. [I'm] Dreaming [of ] a place in the vicinity of a busy place like in Garapan
                    area, so that other artists would be interested to show up their artwork.” Overall, the
                    artists expressed interest in all areas of visual arts and ranked drawing and painting
                    as the two top areas. When answering the survey question about Saipan's strongest
                    and weakest aspects of visual arts, the consensus for strongest aspects of the art
                    community were community support for artists and youth involvement in art events
                    (see Appendix D). The consensus for the weakest aspects were lack of funding for
                    the arts, lack of support for artists, and lack of markets for artists. When posed with
                    the question about the quality of funding the arts received in Saipan, a majority of
                    artists rated the quality “very poor” or “poor” (Figure 2).</p>

                <p>The last questions of the survey asked if the artists would be willing to go to a hy-
                    pothetical art gallery or public arts in Saipan and asked for suggestions of what
                    they would like to see in the art community. All the artist surveys reported that they
                    would go to a hypothetical art space. The following graph (Figure 3) displays the top
                    three kinds of art spaces they would like to see: (1) public art space, (2) mural space,
                    and (3) sculpture space. Meanwhile, the suggestions of other arts projects in the
                    community were as follows: a gallery, museum, cultural center, murals, and public
                    art activities for youth, more arts in education, and sculptures.</p>

                <p>While the general public held varying views about funding, art interests, and the
                    quality of the arts in the community (See Appendix E), the general consensus among
                    those surveyed reflected the same perspective as the artists, “that the arts hold
                    a major importance in generating creativity and expressing oneself, as well as art
                    being a key instrument in what makes people human.” The general public expressed
                    interest in all areas of visual arts, although different age groups favored different art
                    interests. The 14-to-19-year age group preferred photography, film, painting, and
                    drawing (See Appendix F). The 20-to-29-year age group preferred drawing and
                    design (See Appendix G). The 30-to-39-year age group preferred photography and
                    film (See Appendix H). The 40-to-49-year age group preferred ceramics and design
                    (See Appendix I). In regard to art experiences, the younger age group displayed more
                    participation in art classes and events in comparison to the older age group. Despite
                    this contrast, respondents of all ages rated the quality of funding for the arts as rela-
                    tively “poor” or “fair” (Figure 4). creative events</p>

                <p>Since there were more participants for the general public survey than the artist
                    survey, there were more suggestions about what types of projects would be a pleas-
                    ant addition to Saipan's art community. These suggestions included permanent art
                    galleries, museums, monthly art events, rehabilitation of abandoned buildings,
                    roadside artwork, more business opportunities for local artists, free outdoor can-
                    vases, and art parks.</p>

                <p>Among the children (ages 10–11) surveyed, most reported that they take part in
                    drawing. The children also stated that they do not see much art in the Saipan com-
                    munity other than during events like the Flame Tree Arts Festival. All the children
                    indicated that they would like to see more permanent art in Saipan, and that they
                    would be interested in going to a place where they learn more about art and could
                    experience creating art.</p>

                <p>The general survey for the public garnered 29 responses and provided a useful view
                    of the Saipan community's views on art. During data collection, other key topics of
                    concern arose such as the reasons for the lack of adequate funding for the arts in
                    the CNMI and Saipan. In one survey response, a professional artist stated that the
                    prolonged lack of funding in the arts community is due to a ban placed on the CNMI
                    by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from 2005 and was in place for 7 years
                    total. Presently, the ban placed by the NEA has been lifted and the recent efforts by
                    the Northern Marianas Humanities Council aim to cultivate and support the arts.
                    These efforts are currently being covered by the <em>Marianas Variety</em>.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br/>
                    The results of this research and survey suggest that the general consensus among
                    both the public and professional artists is that art is important and essential to all
                    human beings for creativity and expression. The survey group expressed positive
                    and high values for art despite the previous lack of funds and resources to establish
                    foundational creative communities and projects from 2005–2018. Survey partici-
                    pants also suggested a variety of ideas for possible future art projects. The prevalent
                    suggestions were galleries, murals, and sculptures. Due to this perceived value of
                    the arts, an artistically enthusiastic community, and newly reinstated funds, it can
                    be said that the possibility of strengthening Saipan's creative community is stronger
                    today than in the past 10 years. Furthermore, the results from this paper could be
                    used by community leaders and members of the arts council as an aid when forming
                    plans for future events and grants.</p>

                <head>The Thai Community in Saipan (Poonsri Algaier)</head>

                <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Saipan's labor force opened internationally, with immigration
                    under local control by the Commonwealth government. Then, when the international
                    garment industry decided to turn the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
                    Islands (CNMI) into one of its main hubs for production and shipment to the USA, the
                    local economy boomed. That boom attracted a pool of non-immigrant workers from
                    across Asia, and over time included among them thousands of people from Thailand.
                    The Thais who came to Saipan were very concerned about working fast enough to be
                    given the lucrative overtime work that was often available for the most efficient workers
                    in the factories. The vast majority of those who came are now gone, returned to the
                    houses they built on US wages, but some remain. The Thai community continues
                    to be represented among construction workers, massage specialists, restaurant
                    workers, and others.</p>

                <p>Most Thai people came to Saipan to work in garment factories. During the heyday of
                    the multiple factories, with UIC as the largest employer, over 2,000 Thai workers called
                    Saipan home throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thais were also working in
                    construction, hotel businesses, and auto shops. There were up to four Thai grocery
                    stores, two in San Antonio and two in Chalan Kanoa. One of these original grocery
                    stores morphed over time into a restaurant—the Spicy Thai Noodle Place—that still
                    operates in Garapan as of 2018. Other Thai restaurants from the time, many of which
                    have since closed, include: The I-Thai, a Thai-Italian adventure; the Nid Noi Café;
                    Supanahong, Mai-Tai, and a number of unlicensed “casual” outdoor places for Thai
                    and connected non-Thais only. Some restaurants remained after Typhoon Soudelor
                    hit in August 2015, including two in Garapan, the Thai House (since closed) and Wild
                    Bill's.</p>

                <p>As Thais love Thailand, a clamor for representation prompted organization; thus,
                    in 1999, a Thai Association was formed. Dues-paying members supported annual
                    Loy Kratong and Songkran festivals in the Fall and Spring which brought together
                    crowds of revelers from every part of island society and allowed the Thai community
                    to showcase their rich and deep culture. On the full moon night of the twelfth lunar
                    month, usually in November, a Loy Kratong festival was held. Events would include
                    Miss Nopamas beauty contests (Nopamas is a mythical character said to have been
                    the consort of King Ramkamhaeng of the ancient capital Sukothai; she is supposed
                    to have started the first Loy Kratong festival), junior Miss Nopamas contests, banana
                    float contests, traditional dance—ramwong—contests, food, songs, dances, and lavish
                    cultural displays. The first official festival began in 1999 after personal gatherings—
                    parties that grew from year to year—were held on beaches in San Antonio, and Thai
                    Association venues, which lasted until 2006, included Susupe Park and the Pacific
                    Islands Club. Similarly, the Songkran Water Festival, known simply as Songkran,
                    would every year spark joyous celebration among Thais who use the festival as a
                    break from the dogdays of the hot season. In Thailand, Songkran is a nation-wide
                    water fight. In Saipan, it was celebrated as a day-long water ball, barbecue, home-
                    cooked feast, and dance party. Celebrations went on in Thai barracks across the island;
                    crowds at parties in the two Thai barracks in San Antonio, separated by 100 meters,
                    would grow so large one could stand in the middle of the crowd and be in both parties
                    at once. It was a joyous time.</p>

                <p>The Thai Association also acted as a center to collect donations among community
                    members in time of need. Deaths on island, deaths in families back home, home-
                    destroying fires, or disasters either in Saipan or in the Kingdom were always met
                    with generous responses from community members. Thai Association members
                    performed community services such as clean-ups on beaches, in villages, and along
                    the roads. Thai dancers also performed at Flame Tree Festivals, Hot Chili Pepper
                    Festivals in Tinian, and village Saint Days. They trained children to dance and
                    provided traditional Thai costumes for school children on International Days and
                    Cultural Days at various schools in Saipan. Unfortunately, by 2006, due to the rapid
                    departure of many former garment workers following the closure of that industry, the
                    Thai Association was effectively disbanded. Individuals still celebrate the Loy Kratong
                    and Songkran Festival with their friends and families, but no organizational structures
                    exist to make the holiday island-wide celebrations. The barracks that used to house
                    hundreds of Thai workers have largely disappeared, though some Thais continue to
                    stay in their former housing units as caretakers for the now-closed factories.</p>

                <p>After the closing of the garment factories, many Thai workers had to leave. According
                    to a Thai labor survey completed in the first quarter of 2017, there were 143 Thai
                    citizens in Saipan (R. Charoenkhai, personal communication, November 7, 2018).¹⁸
                    Those who remain in the CNMI are those who married into the local community or
                    who got jobs after the garment industry disappeared. Some work as masseuses, taxi
                    drivers, farmers, or with restaurants, hotels, or other companies. Some have private
                    businesses, and some are homemakers. The movement of workers from Thailand
                    to Saipan largely ended with the closure of the garment factories. While a few Thai
                    workers continue to find their way to Saipan, these workers are usually arriving
                    through personal contacts with other Thais who are currently living here.</p>

                <p>The following anecdotes are from a few Thais who still live in Saipan. Their names
                    are pseudonyms.</p>

                <p>Som was a schoolteacher in Thailand, who, because of his eloquent speaking skills,
                    was assigned to be a Community Scouts leader. Community Scouts was a Thai
                    government program to gather ordinary Thai people to fight against the communist
                    insurgency in Thailand. After working as a teacher, he tried his luck with construction
                    in the Middle East. He arrived in Saipan in 1991. He first worked for NTC (now ITandE),
                    then with Tano Group, a construction company. After that he worked as a reverse
                    osmosis operator for a golf course and as a security guard for Pacific Amusement before
                    he joined G4S Secure Solutions (CNMI) Inc. in 2014, where he remains. While working
                    here he was able to send his two children to school in Thailand. His daughter has
                    earned a master's degree in early childhood education; his son has a master's degree
                    in petrochemical engineering. Som assists the Thai people here when they need to
                    renew their passports, obtain Thai birth certificates for their children, or deal with
                    other documents. He is instrumental in arranging for Thai consular officers to visit
                    the island, as they did in February 2017, to provide support for Thai citizens. He also
                    assists the Thai Labor Department in Hong Kong in collecting biodata from the Thai
                    people here. The Labor Department in Hong Kong has jurisdiction over Hong Kong,
                    Guam, Saipan, Rota, Tinian, and Palau. Som likes working and living here in Saipan.
                    His only concern with island life is the way US Citizenship and Immigration Services
                    (USCIS) handles CW-1 visa¹⁹ renewals. He says USCIS may send the worker's acceptance
                    letter either to his home country or to Saipan. If the letter is sent to the home country,
                    the worker will have to go back home, apply for a visa, and wait and wait and wait. It
                    could be weeks or months before he can come back. During this indeterminate waiting
                    period, financial problems become burdensome as workers must meet fixed-cost
                    family obligations while their income has stopped.</p>

                <p>Orn is a female who came to work for UIC garment factory over 20 years ago. Through
                    hard work and smart financial management, at a time when the minimum wage in
                    Saipan was barely over $3 per hour, Orn was able to buy a house in Thailand. Still
                    in Saipan, she is now happily married and helps her husband with his business. She
                    and her husband built a house here too, and they have no plans to relocate anywhere
                    else for the foreseeable future. Orn loves to work in her garden. She enjoys hosting
                    parties on various Thai holidays at her house. For Loy Kratong Festival, she prepares
                    food and makes floats from banana trunks, banana leaves, and fresh flowers. Her
                    guests would enjoy the food and later that night go to the beach to float the kratongs
                    under the moonlight. Though their numbers are smaller, Thai people in Saipan still
                    follow their Thai traditions. On some occasions, Orn will still gather with others at the
                    shrine of Brahmin, to whom some Thai pray for help, at the old Onwel factory ground.
                    Comfortable with syncretic religious practices, Orn will also join others—though she
                    is not Christian—at the Santa Lourdes Shrine to entreat Santa Lourdes for divine
                    intervention. After petitioners get what they ask for, they would offer different kinds
                    of gifts, flowers, food, or dance to the sacred entity. Unlike Som, Orn does not have to
                    worry about a visa. She has a green card through her husband.</p>

                <p>Prakai arrived in Saipan in 1994. She paid a recruiter 50,000 baht (about $2,000 USD
                    at the time) for bringing her here to work for the Sako garment company. She paid
                    him in two payments. There were basically three ways to come to work in Saipan at
                    that time. The first way was through the Thai Labor Department. The second way
                    was through a sponsor who could be a private person or a business owner. And the
                    third way was through a recruiter. After Sako, she got a job in a poker room and
                    worked there for a few years. For self-improvement, she took ESL classes offered by
                    the Adult Basic Education Program at Northern Marianas College. The course was
                    offered on Sundays to accommodate guest workers, and each student paid $40 for
                    the 3-hour-per-week, 10-week course; hundreds enrolled in the courses, helping both
                    to better themselves and to strengthen their connections to the community.</p>

                <p>Prakai is now 52 years old and works as a waitress in a restaurant. When asked if she
                    wanted to go back to Thailand, she said, “yes, eventually, but not now.” Her age and
                    her educational background are big obstacles. She thinks that at 52 it would be hard
                    for her to get a job in Thailand. She would also not make as much money as she can
                    in Saipan. The minimum wage in Thailand varies from province to province, with
                    the highest in Bangkok at 310 Thai baht, about $9 USD, per day in 2017. Prakai notes
                    that her future seems bright. If she is careful, she can cover her rent and electricity for
                    about $250 per month in Saipan. She is saving up for her retirement in Thailand. With
                    more than 20 years of work in Saipan, she will also receive her US Social Security
                    benefits when she reaches the eligible age. She has also inherited a house in Thailand
                    from her parents. Her only concern now is about getting her CW-1 visa renewal.
                    Sometimes even when the employers file the renewal documents in a timely manner,
                    there are still glitches that cause the non-renewal of the CW-1 visa for their employees.
                    Some Thai people who have US-born children are able to get Employment
                    Authorization Documents (EAD) to work here, but Prakai is not one of them. Thus,
                    the suspense and tension she feels while waiting for the renewal of her CW-1 visa
                    continues.</p>

                <p>Prapa came to Saipan as an office worker for a garment factory. She has a vocational
                    degree from Thailand. She picked up both English and Chinese from hearing those
                    two languages in the factory, and she became fluent in both. She is now working
                    as a manager for a local company. Like many Thai men and women in Saipan,
                    Prapa enjoys playing soccer. She currently plays in a competitive women's league
                    on a team that is predominantly Thai. She also stays fit by working out in a fitness
                    center. Married now, with two children, she is also a proud naturalized American
                    citizen.</p>

                <p>Over the past three-plus decades, the existing world trade regulations permitted a
                    booming economy in Saipan that was fueled by garment factories. Times changed,
                    however, and those factories went away. But Som, Orn, Prakai, and Prapa remained.
                    They arrived of their own free will. They created lives: they provided for others, saved
                    for retirement, raised families, bought land and built houses in their home provinces,
                    and came to love their homes in both their lands. The Thais in Saipan came as fully
                    engaged and cognizant economic actors finding their own roles as stars in their own
                    lives. Though fewer in number, they nevertheless persist, and continue to contribute
                    to the Thai community and the wider Saipan community today.</p>

                <head>Family Violence, Historical Trauma, and the CHamoru Manggåfa (the Family) (Lisa Linda S. Natividad)</head>

                <p><em>I manggåfa</em> (the family system) has consistently been the anchoring point of life
                    for CHamorus since time immemorial. CHamorus are the Indigenous peoples of the
                    Mariana Islands of Micronesia, who settled the islands nearly 4,000 years ago.
                    Cunningham (1992) describes the significant role that families played in society:
                    “Ancient Chamorros tried to meet all their obligations and always remain loyal to
                    their family” (p. 94). Despite this longstanding tradition, family violence is a phe-
                    nomenon that impacts CHamoru families today at alarming rates throughout the
                    Mariana Islands. According to the Guam Family Violence Act of 1998, it is defined
                    as follows:</p>

                <p>
                        the occurrence of one (1) or more of the following acts by a family or household
                        member, but does not include acts of self-defense or defense of others:
                        (1) Attempting to cause or causing bodily injury to another family
                        or household member;
                        (2) Placing another family or household member in reasonable fear of immi-
                        nent bodily injury; or
                        (3) Knowingly or intentionally, against the will of another, impeding the normal
                        breathing or circulation of the blood of a family or household member by apply-
                        ing pressure to the throat or neck or by blocking the nose or mouth of a family
                        or household member. (p. 3)
                    </p>

                <p>This chapter explores the intersectionality of family violence and the CHamoru
                    <em>manggåfa</em> (family system) by examining intimate partner abuse, child abuse, and
                    elder abuse. I review available family violence data in Guahån and the Commonwealth
                    of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). To understand the plight of CHamorus
                    today within the context of colonization and oppression, I introduce the theoretical
                    framework of historical trauma. I also examine traditional CHamoru concepts of
                    gender, the marital relationship, parenting practices, and the role of the elderly
                    within the family. Lastly, I discuss implications for practitioners in the field of social
                    services working with CHamoru families.</p>

                <p><strong>Family Violence Across the Marianas Archipelago</strong><br/>
                    People across the Marianas Archipelago have a long and well-documented history
                    of suffering under colonialism. Family violence is a social issue that affects many
                    Indigenous peoples with a history of colonization, and CHamorus are no exception.
                    While the Guahån statute provides the framework for defining family violence, in this
                    chapter, I specifically explore abuse within the family system to include intimate part-
                    ner violence, child abuse and neglect, and elder abuse. Each of these categories can be
                    more precisely identified by the specific type of abuse to include physical, sexual,
                    financial, emotional/psychological/verbal abuse, and neglect. To further contextualize
                    these statistics, I note that in the 2010 US Census, CHamorus comprised 23.9% of the
                    total population in the CNMI and 37.3% in Guahån (CNMI Department of Commerce/
                    Central Statistics Division, n.d.; US Census Bureau, 2014). The minoritization of the
                    Indigenous population in the Mariana Islands is an indicator of a colonial history that
                    has disadvantaged the CHamoru family system by setting the conditions for culture
                    loss.</p>

                <p>Data on family violence cases in the Marianas is uneven at best. In light of the
                    underreporting of cases, coupled with the limited capacity for the integration of
                    reported data, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive look at this social issue. The
                    Guam Police Department's Domestic Assault Response Team (2016-2018) intimate
                    partner violence statistics indicate the total number of cases in recent years as follows:
                    1,442 (2016), 1,383 (2017), and 1,356 (2018). These numbers reflect cases in four categories:
                    kidnapping, intimidation, simple assault, and aggravated assault. The Guam Statistical
                    Yearbook 2017 reported family violence offenders by race and indicated that Pacific
                    Islanders (including people from the Federated States of Micronesia) comprised
                    between 81.3% to 85.5% of perpetrators for the years 2014 to 2017 (Guam Office of
                    the Governor Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018, p. 250). In 2019, The Guam STOP
                    Violence Against Women Primary Victim Data Collection reported that CHamorus
                    comprised a total of 32% of victims of violence. Similarly, CHamorus comprised 30%
                    of offenders. The reported gender of offenders was male in 79% of cases and female
                    in 21% of cases.</p>

                <p>In looking more specifically at child abuse and neglect (CAN) cases in Guahån,
                    Table 1 shows the number of referrals received by Child Protective Services (CPS)
                    from 2012 to 2017 as reported in the Guam Statistical Yearbook 2017 (Guam Office
                    of the Governor Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018). Those figures indicate a gradual
                    decrease in the number of cases. Table 2 breaks down the total referrals by maltreat-
                    ment type that include physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as physical
                    neglect. There are also other forms of neglect not indicated in the table, including
                    medical, educational, and emotional neglect, abandonment, lack of adult supervision,
                    and deprivation of necessities. Table 3 reveals that the most reported co-occurring
                    risk factor at the time of CPS referral was drug use by caretakers. This confirms the
                    confounding relationship between violence and drug and alcohol abuse.</p>

                <p><em>Note.</em> From <em>Guam Statistical Yearbook, 2017</em>, by Guam Office of the Governor Bureau of Statistics and Plans,
                    2018, <a href="http://bsp.guam.gov/wp-bsp-content/uploads/2019/01/2017-GU-STAT-YRBK_Final.pdf">http://bsp.guam.gov/wp-bsp-content/uploads/2019/01/2017-GU-STAT-YRBK_Final.pdf</a></p>

                <p>In examining the cases of reported elder abuse in Guahån, the Bureau of Adult
                    Protective Services reported the number of referrals and indicated that CHamorus
                    demonstrated the highest percentage of referrals ranging from 67–69% between
                    2016–2018 (Table 4). This percentage reveals the overrepresentation of CHamoru
                    cases in relation to their percentage (37.3%) of the island's total population. In addition,
                    the types of reported maltreatment are ranked, with the highest number of referrals
                    for financial/property abuse, followed by neglect, and then emotional/psychological
                    maltreatment. These data clearly show that family violence spans the life cycle,
                    encompassing both child and elder abuse.</p>

                <p>In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), family violence is
                    also a social issue impacting the community. According to Maurin (2019), “the Office
                    of the Attorney General prosecuted 73 cases of domestic violence. This was on top of
                    the 239 calls received by the Department of Public Safety regarding domestic abuse.”
                    While this social issue was traditionally hidden, denied, or excused in the past, recent
                    community educational efforts have helped to reframe the issue as one of power,
                    control, and violence (Lirio, 2018). According to the CNMI Office of the Attorney
                    General (2018), for the years 2015 to 2018, the lowest number of family violence cases
                    occurred in 2017 (48 cases) and the highest number in 2016 (77 cases.</p>

                <p>Official statistics report 200 cases of child abuse and neglect in the CNMI in 2018
                    (Table 5) including a total of 337 allegations that included physical abuse, sexual
                    abuse, emotional abuse, negligence, and other factors (Table 6). The distribution of
                    cases was primarily in Saipan (185 cases), followed by Tinian (10 cases), and Rota
                    (five cases).</p>

                <p>As in Guahån, abuse of the elderly also occurs in the CNMI. According to Walter
                    Manglona from the Office on Aging, the most common type of elder abuse in the
                    Commonwealth is fraud, which includes financial exploitation and scams (Robago,
                    2018). He gave examples such as the misuse of an elderly person's personal checks,
                    credit cards, or other accounts, as well as stealing cash, income checks, household
                    goods, forging signatures, and identity theft. Manglona clarified that elder abuse also
                    includes physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological or non-verbal abuse, as well
                    as neglect.</p>

                <p>The literature on violence within CHamoru families is sparse. Twaddle, Roberto, and
                    Quintanilla (2003) conducted a study examining CHamoru perspectives on mental
                    health issues and their context within Indigenous and Western cultural ideas. The
                    following is an excerpt from a participant discussing intimate partner violence:</p>

                <p>
                        I think there is a lot of spouse abuse in my community and I think a lot of that
                        stems from changes in the ancient Chamorro culture. Women used to be in
                        control; they were the ones everyone respected. Somewhere along the line things
                        changed and now it's the man who acts as the master of the house … If they feel
                        they're not in control in the house, they react by thinking, “If I smack you a little
                        harder, maybe you will notice that I am in control” [Female, 38 years, Maite].
                        (pp. 40-41)
                    </p>

                <p>This participant's sentiment was a reiteration of one offered by Rapadas (1997)
                    when describing perpetrators of family violence on Guåhan. Rapadas is a be-
                    havioral health provider who facilitated group therapy for male perpetrators of
                    family violence through the Superior Court of Guam. He discussed the regional
                    shift from traditional societies that were matrilineal to the current patriarchal
                    culture influenced by colonial powers, wherein men have risen to positions of
                    power in society and the family structure. Rapadas noted that this shift in values
                    and worldview may have led to a decline in the self-esteem and prominence of
                    women and their positioning within <em>i manggåfa</em>. Indications are that this rise of
                    patriarchy and decline of matriarchy provides a fertile ground for family violence
                    to occur. He offered as evidence the consistent increase in the number of cases of
                    family violence in Guåhan.</p>

                <p>Family violence has often been viewed as a poor coping mechanism of Indigenous
                    peoples living in the highly Westernized context of a colonized society (Cheers et al.,
                    2006). Colonization usually brings with it a shift in values and worldview, high levels
                    of stress from the need to acculturate and adapt to the new world order, and feelings
                    of inadequacy. Cheers et al. (2006) remind us that complicit with colonization are
                    experiences of oppression, dispossession, disempowerment, dislocation, and poverty.
                    Hence, CHamorus' manifestation of family violence is consistent with other Indigenous
                    communities as they deal with the stressors of life in an environment that disempowers
                    the very essence of their identity in a colonial context. These contemporary experiences
                    are rooted in the erasure of traditional systems that define Indigenous peoples, as
                    well as the invalidation of their very existence in modern society.</p>

                <p><strong>Historical Trauma, Family Violence, and Indigenous Peoples</strong><br/>
                    The intersectionality of Indigenous peoples, family violence, and historical trauma
                    is a consistent theme in the relevant literature. Historical trauma is defined “as a
                    cumulative emotional and psychological wounding across generations, including the
                    lifespan, which emanates from massive group trauma” (Braveheart et al., 2011, p. 282).
                    The concept of historical trauma has been used to describe the American Indian
                    experience of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and communal trauma as a
                    result of genocide, colonization, assimilation, and social exclusion.</p>

                <p>Fast and Collin-Vezina (2010) conducted a meta-analysis of the literature examining
                    historical trauma and Indigenous peoples. They shared findings from Evans-Campbell,
                    who highlighted the inadequacy of a PTSD diagnosis because the diagnosis does not
                    capture the trauma experienced across generations. Evans-Campbell established three
                    criteria for historical trauma: 1) it was experienced by many people; 2) high levels of
                    stress were generated; and 3) outsiders perpetrated the events with destructive intent.
                    She further posited that historical trauma impacts the individual, the family, and the
                    larger community: individuals experience depression, anxiety, or grief; families strug-
                    gle with effective communication and parenting issues; and the larger community
                    exhibits a breakdown of traditional values and practices, internalized racism, and high
                    rates of social problems.</p>

                <p>Gurm (2020) describes how Indigenous peoples continue to experience the effects
                    of trauma for generations, particularly as manifested in violence against women and
                    girls. Specifically examining Indigenous women in Canada, Gurm (2020) reports that
                    Indigenous women were twice as likely to experience intimate partner violence as
                    compared to non-Indigenous women. Indigenous peoples in Canada's colonial history
                    repeatedly experienced the removal of children from their homes and their placement
                    in residential schools. Indigenous peoples were grossly over-represented in incarcer-
                    ation rates, comprising 27% of incarcerations in both 2017 and 2018 but only 3% of the
                    population. Of those incarcerated, 50% reported experiences of family violence as
                    children. Equally shocking is the number of murdered and missing Indigenous women
                    and girls in Canada, who are 12 times more likely to be killed or go missing as compared
                    to other ethnic groups (Gurm, 2020).</p>

                <p>Gurm (2020) reports that Indigenous peoples globally suffer a comparable outcome
                    with high rates of family violence, as evidenced in the Aboriginal peoples of Australia
                    and the Māori of Aotearoa (New Zealand). Efforts to eradicate traditional practices,
                    coupled with inequality, racism, and the lack of cultural safety within systems, are
                    traumatic experiences that contribute to family violence. Further, Vickers and Moyer
                    (2020) draw the connection between historical and ongoing colonialism and the loss
                    of identity and support, fragmentation of the family system, loneliness, and psychological
                    distress in Indigenous populations.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, CHamorus have suffered a similar fate as indicated in the aforemen-
                    tioned statistics. The intersectionality of ongoing colonialism, war and related
                    invasions, the high risk for poverty, and structural racism helps to contextualize
                    the high rates of family violence for CHamorus in the Marianas. Their experience
                    of historical trauma is related to land dispossession, language loss, the demon-
                    ization of traditional spirituality, identity and role confusion, experiences of World
                    War II atrocities, and historical and ongoing colonialism. Pier (1998) investigated
                    the intergenerational transmission of historic community trauma affecting CHamorus
                    and indicates that such experiences pose mental health concerns. In an unsettling
                    parallel, Braveheart et al. (2011) report that the prevalence of serious psychiatric
                    disorders among American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations is
                    rooted in the experience of collective, communal, and generational trauma that
                    manifests today as racism, oppression, and discrimination. Having a mental health
                    diagnosis is a confounding variable for family violence, and such dynamics are
                    prevalent in Indigenous populations in the Marianas, as they are for Indigenous
                    populations around the world.</p>

                <p><strong>Traditional CHamoru Concepts of the Family (I Manggåfa)</strong><br/>
                    While CHamorus continue to endure colonization today, many traditional values
                    remain intact, including the value of <em>i manggåfa</em> (the family system). In present
                    times, <em>i manggåfa</em> continues to play a critical role in the lives of CHamorus and
                    remains the foundation of society. Consequently, traditional concepts of <em>i manggåfa</em>
                    provide a framework for understanding contemporary familial dynamics, particularly
                    those of family violence. The CHamoru creation account describes how humanity was
                    born out of Fouha Rock in Humåtak (Umatac), as fashioned by the primordial brother
                    and sister, Pontan and Fo'na. The cross-sibling relationship in the account speaks
                    to CHamorus' value of familial relationships and the brother-sister pair as the “basic
                    building block” of matrilineal societies found throughout Micronesia (Marshall,
                    1981). According to Underwood (1992):</p>

                <p>
                        The family, in its various manifestations throughout Micronesia is the unit that
                        traditionally has kept the society intact, responsive, and responsible in the face
                        of change. Micronesians, by an overwhelming majority, see families as the basic
                        building blocks of society; moreover, they tend to see each other not as individu-
                        als with particular professions or personalities, but as people from certain fami-
                        lies. This family orientation is healthy and necessary for their continued survival
                        as Micronesians, for it is in the family context that most serious discussions occur
                        and most decisions are made. (p. 169)
                    </p>

                <p>With the extensive history of colonization of the Mariana Islands by the Spanish for
                    over two centuries, the common reference for “family” used in the CHamoru language
                    is the adopted Spanish word, <em>familia</em>. As the global community has slowly shifted
                    to embrace indigeneity, CHamorus have further embarked upon the processes of
                    political and personal decolonization. As part of the latter, there has been great
                    emphasis on reclaiming more authentic, Indigenous, and decolonized concepts of
                    culture and language, including the use of archaic terms in the CHamoru language,
                    also referred to as <em>Fino' Håya</em>. More specifically, <em>Fino' Håya</em> uses Indigenous and
                    pre-colonial words that were not introduced by the island's colonizers—particularly
                    the Spanish, Germans, Japanese, or Americans. Hence, in exploring CHamoru concepts
                    of <em>manggåfa</em>, it is critical to examine the <em>Fino' Håya</em> references to family.</p>

                <p>Early accounts of CHamorus and the role of the family have been documented by
                    a number of foreign observers, including Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora and Louis
                    Claude de Freycinet. Each wrote extensive accounts of their observations of the
                    CHamoru culture and other aspects of life in the Marianas. Freycinet (2003) revealed
                    a number of word references to the concept of family for CHamorus. He noted that
                    CHamorus referred to family as <em>manggåfa</em> and to one's blood relatives as <em>atchafgnang</em>,
                    who were obliged to carry out familial duties. He defined <em>atchagma</em> as those who
                    were related by friendship and who were assigned specific duties, and <em>atugcha-guma</em>
                    as those who had family relations through a specific connection or obligation, as in
                    the case of someone who saved the life of one's child. The <em>atugcha-guma</em> was typically
                    given a <em>guneha famaguan</em> (<em>guinahan famagu'on</em>), or turtle shell necklace pendant with
                    drilled holes representing each of one's children. This custom is consistent with
                    CHamoru reciprocity practices and is an effort to make <em>empas</em>, or even, for the debt
                    of saving the child's life. Freycinet also described children who were <em>pinigsai</em>
                    (<em>pineksai</em>)—adopted into the family and regarded as biological children entrusted to
                    the care and protection of the women. He reported that relationships were closest
                    with the mother's side of the family system, and that women's requests were obliged
                    over those of men.</p>

                <p><strong>Gender Roles and Marriage</strong><br/>
                    Consistent with CHamorus' matrilineal, matriarchal, and matricentric organization
                    of society, women were noted as having a prominent role in the clan—particularly
                    evident in the <em>maga'håga</em> or female chief. The role of the <em>maga'håga</em> complemented
                    that of the <em>maga'låhi</em> (male chief), and together they managed affairs as the highest-
                    ranking male and female in the clan. Women were traditionally responsible for
                    managing the affairs of the house, raising children, fishing inside the reef, food
                    preparation, weaving, and making pottery. Men, on the other hand, were the
                    navigators, fishermen outside the reef, and tool makers. Nonetheless, there existed a
                    complementary relationship between them. According to Mendiola (2019), “Chamorros
                    were able to find a societal equilibrium as both men and women—the eldest brother
                    and sister—were co-equal guardians and administrators of clans and their resources”
                    (para. 3). The status of men and women in CHamoru society was historically one
                    of complementarity, giving respect and responsibilities to each in different spheres
                    of communal life. Hence, men and women functioned on equal planes, not one
                    holding a position of power over the other. Rather, both assumed complementary
                    roles in society, and each was equally respected and revered for their contributions.</p>

                <p>Freycinet (2003) described the role of CHamoru women as having “the direction of
                    public affairs … in their hands. At home, they were absolute mistresses and had the
                    command of everything; nothing was done without first obtaining their opinion or
                    consent” (p. 183). Russell (1998) noted:</p>

                <p>
                        It is clear from these accounts that while the men may have been the warriors
                        and navigators, the women were the heads of household and were quick to
                        assert their prerogatives. For instance, the husband did not dare give an order
                        contrary to [his wife's] wishes, nor punish the children, for she [would] turn
                        upon him and beat him. (p. 150)
                    </p>

                <p>These accounts highlight women's significant role in the household and in affairs
                    concerning children. One reason given for the prominent role of women is their
                    sacred ability to bear children.</p>

                <p>Women thus assumed the role of household heads, inclusive of decision-making
                    and parenting. Souder (as cited in Russell, 1998) underscores these functions and
                    references the active role of women in matters of familial inheritance:</p>

                <p>
                        Females—particularly elder women in the clan, who were married and moth-
                        ers—were powerful in all spheres of … society. Through [the] matrilineal
                        kinship system, women exercised control over family life, property, and inheri-
                        tance. They assumed a central role and possessed strong bargaining powers in
                        their marriage … Their esteemed status was also reflected in rituals, legends,
                        and ceremonial events. (p. 150)
                    </p>

                <p>Although women were highly respected and regarded for their ability to bear children
                    and for their role as traditional owners of clan land, men were not subordinate or
                    secondary to them. Describing honors accorded to fathers, Freycinet (2003) observed
                    that when a child of status was born, rice was thrown at the father's feet as a sign of
                    respect; also, children's names were based on the skills of their fathers, e.g., Nineti
                    (ingenious) or Tai-agnao (intrepid). These examples highlight the complementarity
                    of the male-female relationship and respect given to fathers of the clan.</p>

                <p>The prominence of <em>manggåfa</em> is reiterated in examining traditional CHamoru
                    practices relative to marriage. Freycinet (2003) also addressed the sanctity of marriage
                    and potential consequences of infidelity:</p>

                <p>
                        An adulterous woman, who had been repudiated by her husband and sent back
                        to her mother's house after judgment, was stripped of her possessions at the
                        same time … But he was perfectly free to avenge himself upon the seducer for
                        the insult received, even to the point of killing him. (p. 183)
                    </p>

                <p>Likewise, when women were angry at their husbands, Freycinet (2003) explained:</p>

                <p>
                        All the women kept it, a spear in their hand and their husband's hat on their
                        head. In that marital guise, they then advance as a unit on the house of the
                        guilty man. First, they lay waste his crops and tear up his cereals, trampling
                        them down, then they strip his fruit trees of their fruit and create an appalling
                        mess. Finally, they descend upon the dwelling itself, and if the wretched hus-
                        band has not taken precaution of betaking himself elsewhere and finding cover,
                        they attack him too, and chase him right out. (p. 183)
                    </p>

                <p>In both accounts, violence could result: in the former, from an enraged husband
                    toward his wife's paramour; and in the latter, from groups of women toward a
                    husband. Fray Juan Pobre de Zamora described similar reactions to infidelity:</p>

                <p>
                        when a man and a woman marry and live together in a house, although they
                        have been married twenty or thirty years, if the husband is unfaithful to his
                        wife, or takes a mistress, and if it should anger his wife, she will leave the house,
                        taking the children and all the household furniture and effects, and will go to
                        the house of her parents or of other relatives, where she will remain. During all
                        this time, the children will not acknowledge their father, even though he may
                        pass very close to them. Before the wife will return to the husband, his relatives
                        will have to go to great lengths to do so. If the wife is unfaithful to the husband,
                        her relatives do not have to go to such lengths because it is easier to obtain the
                        husband's pardon since this sin is considered less serious for the women than
                        for the men. (Driver, 1989, p. 21)
                    </p>

                <p>Marriage in ancient CHamoru society involved unions between a man and a woman
                    and thus between their clans, with each clan's resources coming into play. In a
                    matrilineal society, land is transmitted through the maternal line, giving women
                    great power. Combined with their ability to bear children, this bestows upon women
                    a special prominence in society—a dynamic perhaps explaining the privileges many
                    women historically wielded. In contemporary times, however, the introduction of
                    patriarchal values through the Catholic Church and Westernization has shifted
                    society from an egalitarian system to one viewing the male as head of household,
                    principal decision maker, and holder of resources. Land is now often passed on to
                    sons so that they may provide for their families. Such introduced patriarchy has
                    strained CHamoru families, as men attempt to assert a non-traditional leading role
                    and reduce women's status. This disruption fosters role confusion and a greater
                    incidence of intimate partner violence.</p>

                <p><strong>Parenting and the Role of Children</strong><br/>
                    Children hold a place of great importance in the CHamoru <em>manggåfa</em>. Consistent
                    with agrarian societies, CHamoru families were large. Like other Micronesian peoples,
                    CHamorus viewed children as resources—improving the clan's capacities and wealth.
                    Although both parents had responsibilities in parenting, children were considered to
                    belong to the mother's clan.</p>

                <p>Juan Pobre detailed the love and care afforded children:</p>

                <p>
                        While they are very young, they make their sons and daughters work and teach
                        them to perform their tasks. Consequently, the very young know how to per-
                        form their tasks like their parents because they have been taught with great love.
                        So great is their love for their children that it would take a long time to describe
                        it and to sing it praises. They never spank them, and they even scold them with
                        loving words. When a child is offended and angered by what is said to him, he
                        will move a short distance away from his parents and turn his back to them, not
                        wanting to face them. They will then toss sand or pebbles on the ground behind
                        him and after he has cried for a little while, one of his parents will go to him and,
                        with very tender words, will take him in his arms or raise him to his shoulders
                        and carry him back to where the others are gathered. Then they will always give
                        him some of their best food and speaking to them as if he were an adult, tell him
                        how he should behave, admonishing him to be good. With such great love, these
                        barbarians raise their children, that they, in turn, grow up to be obedient and
                        expert in their occupations and skills. (Driver, 1989, p. 17)
                    </p>

                <p>This historical account depicts an affectionate childrearing style, forming a poten-
                    tial reference point for parents today. Fathers, too, played a key role in rearing their
                    children, especially their sons. Juan Pobre observed:</p>

                <p>
                        At the age of four or five, they teach their sons to go out to sea in little boats
                        that they build for them, and which have their own outriggers that are iden-
                        tical to those on their fathers' larger boats. By the age of fourteen, they have
                        come so skilled at using them, that the sons know as much as their fathers; by
                        the time they are sixteen or eighteen, the sons put out to sea to fish alone, as
                        I have seen them do. Alone in his funei, he sets the sails, bails the boat, and
                        fishes with a hook and net; if it capsizes, he rights it, so great is their strength.
                        (Driver, 1989, p. 15)
                    </p>

                <p>This reveals the father's importance in socializing his son in his gendered role. Yet
                    today, the presence of child abuse and neglect among CHamorus seems to contradict
                    these accounts. Pressures of colonialism, Westernization, poverty, and other stressors
                    contribute to raising risks for child abuse.</p>

                <p><strong>I Manåmko' (Elderly) / Mañaina (Parents/Parental Figures)</strong><br/>
                    The elderly, or <em>manåmko'</em>, are historically and still valued members of <em>i manggåfa</em>
                    among CHamorus. Contemporary CHamorus also call them <em>mañaina</em>, recognized
                    as parental figures. <em>Mañaina</em> are honored for their knowledge and wisdom, holding
                    decision-making and mentoring roles in the clan.</p>

                <p>As cultural bearers, <em>mañaina</em> preserve traditions, genealogy, and <em>inafa'maolek</em>
                    (collective peace). Their permission is sought for family decisions. Respect accorded
                    them is visible in <em>mannginge'</em>, the custom of gently sniffing an elder's hand,
                    metaphorically inhaling their spirit and wisdom, with the elder bestowing blessings
                    on the younger.</p>

                <p>While <em>mañaina</em> typically remain in the family home until death, the incidence
                    of elder abuse is evident, often involving financial exploitation. The contradiction
                    between tradition and current reality may be explained by the constraints of
                    colonization, Western property law, and poverty. In a worldview grounded in col-
                    lectivism, an elder's resources can be interpreted as belonging to the extended family,
                    though through a Western lens, this is deemed illegal.</p>

                <p><strong>Implications for Social Service Practitioners</strong><br/>
                    Research consistently finds that Indigenous families' experiences of family violence
                    and historical trauma suggest the need for culture-based approaches (Braveheart
                    et al., 2011; Fast andamp; Collin-Vezina, 2010; Gurm, 2020; Klingspohn, 2018; Pihama et al.,
                    2019; Vickers andamp; Moyer, 2020). Given the high rates of family violence among CHamorus,
                    practitioners should integrate traditional <em>manggåfa</em> concepts into their services
                    for culturally safe and effective interventions.</p>

                <p>“Cultural competence requires self-awareness, cultural humility, and the commit-
                    ment to understanding and embracing culture as central to effective practice”
                    (National Association of Social Workers, 2015, p. 6). Practitioners should learn
                    about CHamoru beliefs, remain humble, and let clients serve as experts on their
                    own lives. “Cultural safety” includes creating an environment in which CHamoru
                    culture and identity are nurtured, validated, and integrated, facilitating healing and
                    empowerment.</p>

                <p>Likewise, Gurm (2020) underscores the need to draw from Indigenous knowledge
                    systems, have Indigenous practitioners or elders in program roles, and embed
                    worldview, spirituality, and ceremonies in interventions. Pihama et al. (2019) call
                    for healing at both personal and collective levels and for building upon existing
                    cultural paradigms. Klingspohn (2018) similarly highlights ceremonies and group
                    contexts like the talking circle, relevant for CHamoru families, in order to unify
                    them around genealogies, shared traditions, and collective healing.</p>

                <p>In practice, agencies may adapt the following: hiring culturally competent staff,
                    ensuring language access for CHamoru speakers, creating consultation mecha-
                    nisms for <em>mañaina</em>, referencing ancestry during treatment, teaching CHamoru
                    legends (e.g., the Taga legend) as metaphors for family violence, and employing
                    historical accounts as frameworks for rediscovering the complementarity and
                    reciprocal respect that historically guided men, women, and children in CHamoru
                    society. Finally, CHamoru families can be guided to adopt commitments such as
                    an <em>Inafa'moalek Family Pledge</em>, adapted from de La Cruz and Natividad (2017),
                    to explicitly commit themselves to nonviolence and to upholding peace and love at
                    home.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
                    This chapter addressed the intersection of family violence, historical trauma, and
                    CHamoru families in the Marianas. By juxtaposing contemporary findings on family
                    violence with historically documented Indigenous practices, we can see how col-
                    onization has eroded CHamoru cultural values, including the historically matrilineal
                    and complementary gender roles in <em>i manggåfa</em>. Future service models stand to be
                    more effective when aligned with CHamoru beliefs and can potentially restore
                    <em>inafa'maolek</em> as a guiding principle. Empowering CHamorus to reclaim traditional
                    values and identity can help them address family violence rooted in historical
                    trauma, and together they can journey toward peace.</p>

                <head>Ti Siña Ma Funas Ham: Shapes of CHamoru Erasure in Guam (Kenneth Gofigan Kuper)</head>

                <p>Driving around Guam, one is likely to see “TANO Y CHAMORRO”²⁰ printed on the
                    bottom half of our license plates. Translated as “Land of the CHamoru,” this phrase
                    serves as a reminder that Guam (as part of the Marianas Archipelago) is the home-
                    land of the CHamoru people. Guam is CHamoru land, and this is an unchangeable
                    fact. Yet, this does not deter some from conjuring the dark magic of trying to change
                    what should be unchangeable. In March 2017, District Court of Guam Judge Francis
                    Tydingco-Gatewood ruled in favor of plaintiff Arnold “Dave” Davis in <em>Davis v. Guam</em>:
                    </p>

                <p>
                        Davis sued the government of Guam in federal court in hopes of overturning
                        the Guam law limiting the electorate in any future self-determination plebi-
                        scite to those falling within the statutory definition of a “native inhabitant of
                        Guam,” or those persons who became US citizens by virtue of the passage in
                        Congress of the 1950 Organic Act of Guam (and descendants of those persons).
                        (Aguon, 2014, p. 282)
                    </p>

                <p>Gatewood ruled in favor of Davis: “Having found that the classification is racial, this
                    court finds that the Plebiscite statute impermissibly imposed race-based restrictions
                    on the voting rights of non-Native inhabitants of Guam, in violation of the Fifteenth
                    Amendment” (<em>Davis v. Guam</em>, 2017). The Government of Guam would appeal this
                    ruling and after the US Supreme Court denied hearing the case, the Government
                    of Guam officially exhausted local and national remedies. Thus, <em>Davis v. Guam</em>
                    stands.²¹ This ruling demonstrates friction between the colonial US legal system
                    and genuine CHamoru self-determination in Guam when it comes to the political
                    status plebiscite. This case is but one example, I argue, of the unjust treatment of
                    CHamorus as the Indigenous people of the island being erased in favor of a “one
                    amongst many” discourse, or what Kanaka Maoli scholar, Kehaulani Kauanui,
                    (2008) calls “colonialism through equality.”</p>

                <p>In this chapter, I argue that this logic of erasure is not confined to this example; I
                    use settler colonial theory to elucidate the ways CHamoru erasure can be found in
                    various shapes in Guam. Tracking these shapes is an important and necessary task
                    to help prevent further instances of CHamoru erasure, whether planned or not. I
                    trace these shapes of erasure in Guam from physical militarization to settler colonial
                    logics and discourses enforced by American legal institutions. I am inspired by Dine
                    scholar Glen Coulthard (2014), who argues that in order to maintain its dominance
                    temporally and spatially, colonial power has shape-shifted from being primarily ex-
                    clusive and assimilationist in structure to more accommodating and engaging. Yet,
                    it is still colonial in its foundation. Thus, I aim to dissect the anatomy of CHamoru
                    erasure with an eye towards understanding the physiology of how these seemingly
                    disparate anatomical parts coalesce to pump the blood of erasure in Guam today.</p>

                <p>To accomplish that goal, this chapter is divided into four parts. In the first section,
                    I introduce Guam and engage with settler colonial theory to situate my usage of
                    erasure and show that despite not meeting the typical characteristics of settler co-
                    lonialism, the logics of settler colonialism still operate in Guam today and can be a
                    useful analytic. The second section then traces the physical history of “destroying
                    and replacing” during and after World War II, which helped create the conditions
                    of possibility for further CHamoru erasure today. I argue that this material trans-
                    formation of the island set the stage for other forms of erasure. The third section
                    then demonstrates the discursive operationalization of this process of erasure in the
                    present day through the imposition of settler colonial logics, particularly a disguised
                    form of multiculturalism. In this section, I also further explore the legal shape of
                    CHamoru erasure via the lawfare of individual rights to hinder the CHamoru push
                    for self-determination. The final section then outlines paths forward for CHamoru
                    and non-CHamoru relationships that are not predicated on erasure.</p>

                <p><strong>Guam and Settler Colonialism</strong><br/>
                    At present, Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Due
                    to this political status, the people of Guam, most being citizens of the United States,
                    have no voting representation in the US House of Representatives, no representation
                    in the US Senate, and no votes in the Electoral College, which elects the President
                    of the United States. Furthermore, as an unincorporated territory, Guam falls under
                    the plenary power or “full and complete legislative authority” of Congress as a result
                    of Article IV, Section III, Clause II of the United States Constitution, also known as
                    the Territorial Clause (Sparrow, 2006). Per the Insular Cases, Guam is considered
                    “foreign in a domestic sense” to the American polity (<em>Downes v. Bidwell</em>, 1901). As
                    former Governor of Guam, Joseph Ada (1989), wrote, “Guam is governed exclusively
                    under rules designed at the height of imperial fever, at a time when some legal fic-
                    tion was needed to justify the maintenance of war booty, to justify the rule of people
                    in a condition similar to serfdom.”</p>

                <p>Demographically, as of 2010, Guam had a population of 159,358 people with indige-
                    nous CHamorus comprising only 37.1% of the total population (US Census Bureau,
                    2010). Intertwined with this political status and demographic situation, the island
                    is also heavily militarized. The US military currently occupies roughly 27% of the
                    island, which is a mere 32 miles long and 12 miles wide. There is a large air force
                    base in the north (Andersen Air Force Base), a navy base in the south (Naval Base
                    Guam), the continuing development of a new Marine Corps installation, a THAAD
                    anti-missile defense system, and a naval ordnance annex all located on the island.
                    Guam currently serves as a critical piece in US strategy and power-projection in
                    the Indo-Pacific. Guam's role in maintaining American preponderance in this region
                    has remained constant, and this is important to understand not only Guam's place in
                    the world, but also CHamoru erasure. It is the entanglement of Guam's geographical
                    location and political status that serves as the primary reason for US presence in the
                    island. To put it another way, this is the key to erasure.</p>

                <p>At first glance, Guam might not seem a good fit for settler colonial analysis. I argue
                    that although not being a “textbook” settler colony, settler colonial theory helps to
                    explain the processes of erasure accompanying political colonization and militariza-
                    tion. Settler colonialism refers to a “historically created system of power that aims to
                    expropriate Indigenous territories and eliminate modes of production in order to re-
                    place Indigenous peoples with settlers who are discursively constituted as superior
                    and thus more deserving over these contested lands and resources” (Saranillo, 2015,
                    p. 284). In his article, “Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native,” Patrick
                    Wolfe (2006) argues that territoriality is the driving force of settler colonialism and
                    that “settler society required the practical elimination of the Natives in order to es-
                    tablish itself on their territory” (p. 389), thus making settler colonialism inherently
                    eliminatory. Wolfe (2006) dubs this the “logic of elimination.” Unlike traditional
                    colonies, labor is not necessarily key in settler colonialism, land is. When looking
                    at settler colonies around the world such as Hawai‘i, Australia, the United States,
                    or Canada, Guam has glaring differences. Unlike the situation of Indigenous peo-
                    ples in the aforementioned examples, CHamorus still make up the largest portion
                    of the population (even if only 37%) and still control the mechanisms of political
                    power at the local territorial level. At the time of writing in 2021, CHamorus make
                    up a majority of the senators in the Guam Legislature, comprise a majority of the
                    Guam Supreme and Superior Court, and serve in the highest positions of the Guam
                    Executive Branch, including the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and most cabinet
                    positions. Thus, one could argue that CHamorus have not been eliminated.</p>

                <p>However, settler colonialism as an analytic is still relevant. As described by Lorenzo
                    Veracini, “settler colonialism as paradigm emphasized circumstances primarily
                    characterized by a determination to erase colonized subjectivities rather than re-
                    produce their subordination” (Cavanagh andamp; Veracini, 2017, p. 3). Furthermore, “The
                    scholars contributing to settler colonial studies have emphasized the continuing
                    operation of an unchanged set of unequal relations. Settler colonialism as a mode
                    of domination, it was often noted, has typically resisted formal decolonization”
                    (Cavanagh andamp; Veracini, 2017, p. 3). Core characteristics of settler colonialism make
                    it relevant to understanding the shape of colonialism in Guam today, such as the
                    drive for territoriality and land, the continued operation of an unchanged set of
                    unequal relations, and a determination to erase colonized subjectivities.</p>

                <p><strong>Destroy and Replace</strong><br/>
                    The nature of the United States' relationship to Guam has been evident almost
                    since the moment the former obtained the latter as a spoil of the Spanish-American
                    War in 1898. The US military would subsequently establish a naval presence on the
                    island, thus beginning the drive for territoriality and land that in part characterizes
                    its settler colonialism in the region. During this period, the island was used as a
                    coaling station with the highest-ranking naval officer serving as the governor of
                    the island. Alfred Thayer Mahan, who served as president of the Naval War College,
                    emphasized the importance of a strong naval capability if the United States wanted
                    to scramble for the world's wealth. Mahan (2004) argued that permanent naval bases
                    and coaling stations were crucial to safeguarding the national security of the United
                    States and urged the country to shape a “healthy regional balance of power through
                    forward basing, a strong navy and alignment among the maritime powers” (p. 3).
                    In line with Mahan's strategic thinking, Guam was used as both a coaling station and
                    a naval possession of the US military. While the United States would utilize Guam as
                    a naval possession from 1899 to 1941, World War II and its aftermath served as a
                    turning point in Guam's transformation. I argue that the physical destruction of the
                    island, taking of CHamoru land, and subsequent emigration and immigration con-
                    stitute three elements of material erasure after the war.</p>

                <p>On December 8, 1941, the Japanese bombed Guam just 4 hours after they bombed
                    Pearl Harbor in Oʻahu. From December 1941 to July 1944, CHamorus suffered under
                    brutal Japanese occupation that involved intense manual labor, rapes, beheadings,
                    and massacres. In 1944, 3 years into the Japanese occupation, the United States
                    returned to the island, eventually defeating the Japanese and re-establishing con-
                    trol over the island. This reoccupation and its subsequent consequences helped
                    physically transform the island into its current status as a giant military base. As
                    part of the US plan to retake the island from the Japanese, they engaged in heavy
                    bombardment. As a result of this approach and the wider conflict, about 80% of
                    the island's permanent structures were destroyed and the capital of Hagåtña was
                    nearly completely bombarded into concrete rubble (Political Status Education
                    Coordinating Commission, 1994). According to Guam historian Pedro Sanchez
                    (1988), “Not a single dwelling remained in Asan, Piti, Agat, and Sumay, the pre-war
                    hometowns of over 4,000 Chamorros” (p. 254).</p>

                <p>During the remainder of the war and during the reconstruction of the island there-
                    after, the military engaged in rampant land takings. By 1946, over 200,000 military
                    personnel were stationed in Guam, with only one-third of the land remaining in
                    CHamoru hands. By 1947, 1,350 families had lost their lands to the military, with
                    11,000 of the 20,000 inhabitants in Hagåtña and Sumay alone being displaced and
                    relocated. While CHamorus were not completely resistant to land being “tempo-
                    rarily” taken by the military for bases to finish the war, what angered them was
                    the military taking of land for the construction of recreational facilities. As Anne
                    Perez Hattori (2001) writes, “In Agaña, roughly five hundred people were displaced
                    when eighty-two lots were condemned for a park and in Tamuning, sixty hectares of
                    Tumon Beach were condemned for a military recreational center” (p. 190).</p>

                <p>The war and these land takings did not just lead to the dispossession of CHamorus
                    from their land, but also led to non-CHamorus becoming a majority of the popu-
                    lation in two ways: CHamoru emigration and non-CHamoru immigration. With a
                    significant amount of the land bombarded during the war, the prevalent pre-war
                    CHamoru subsistence lifestyle was nearly impossible. In 1940, there were an esti-
                    mated 2,747 CHamoru farmers in Guam, with the number dropping to a mere 311 by
                    1960 (del Valle, 1979). This violent interruption of CHamoru sustainability led many
                    CHamorus to move to the United States for higher education, economic opportunities,
                    and military service (Untalan, 2015). Furthermore, another impetus for emigration
                    was the lifting of Guam' security clearance in 1962 along with the development of a
                    tourism industry and the subsequent spike in CHamoru land sales as the commer-
                    cial real estate market boomed. According to the decennial census there were 30,695
                    CHamorus in the United States in 1980, 49,345 in 1990, and around 97,000 in 2010.
                    This continuous exodus reinforces Patrick Wolfe's (2006) argument that invasion is
                    a structure, not an event. By this he means “elimination is an organizing principle of
                    settler-colonial society rather than a one-off (and superseded) occurrence” (p. 388).
                    Thus, one cannot just point to the battles of World War II to explain Guam's current
                    ontology; one has to understand WWII as a structural condition of possibility for the
                    transformation of the island. In a similar fashion, CHamoru erasure is a result of this
                    entangled structure of postwar militarization and colonialism.</p>

                <p>As CHamorus left, postwar Guam also saw the influx of non-CHamorus into the
                    island. A large group of Filipinos was brought into Guam as “H-2 workers” for labor
                    and construction detail. Before the war, there were only a few hundred Filipinos in
                    Guam. However, by 1950, there were around 7,258, and as of 2010, there were 41,944
                    Filipinos, equivalent to 26% of Guam's population (Quan, 2014). There was also a large
                    White population in Guam during the postwar era, many of them being transient per-
                    sonnel to fill positions in administration and education. In 1950, Whites comprised
                    39% of the population, though this number has dropped immensely since then.
                    Fellow islanders from the rest of Micronesia also moved to Guam after the Compacts
                    of Free Association, which allowed travel to and from United States soil without a
                    visa, and these immigrants now make up around 12% of the population. This in itself
                    is not problematic, but rather illustrative of the lack of control CHamorus had over
                    what their island would become after the war, producing unequal relations between
                    the Indigenous people of Guam and the US military (via the US federal government)
                    when it came to subsequently making decisions affecting the island. Yet this lack of
                    control did not mean lack of CHamoru resistance. When it came to the taking of
                    land, for example, CHamorus made their voices heard. When representatives of the
                    US Congress visited Guam in 1949, CHamorus such as Frank Perez testified how un-
                    fair the compensation process for the land was. Furthermore, the Guam Congress,
                    which was only an advisory body, did everything within its power to help resolve the
                    land issues, from holding conferences with naval officials, to asking for legal clarifi-
                    cation and pushing for US citizenship to gain protection from unbridled power.</p>

                <p>Overall, these changes would have lasting ramifications for the island. These events
                    helped set the stage for the island's contemporary status as an American territory
                    with heavy military presence. Changing the material realities of the island enabled
                    other forms of erasure. Dean Saranillo (2015) argues that there is a “mutual relation-
                    ship between the occupation of contested space and controlling the representation
                    of this occupation” (p. 285). This section explores the former, while the next section
                    explores the latter through an examination of the ways that settler colonialism has
                    instrumentalized multicultural discourse (backed by the US legal system) to nor-
                    malize the island's current conditions.</p>

                <p>Lastly, it is important to note that I am not concerned with intent here. One might
                    argue that the United States had a deliberate plan for CHamoru erasure and wanted
                    to create a <em>terra nullius</em>²² dream. One could also argue that CHamoru erasure was not
                    an intent and that it was a side effect of all the elements of converting the island into
                    a military base. Whether it was the intent of the United States or not, the fact is that
                    the post-World War II militarization of the island helped to create the conditions of
                    success for discursive CHamoru erasure in Guam today.</p>

                <p><strong>Erasure through “One Amongst Many”</strong><br/>
                    In this section, I trace the ways that a particular form of multiculturalism has pro-
                    duced a “one amongst many” discourse in Guam. By “one amongst many,” I refer
                    to the idea that CHamorus are just like any other group in Guam, and attempts to
                    honor their indigeneity is a threat to the multicultural fabric of Guam's community.
                    In doing this, there is an erasure of their subjectivity as “colonized peoples” in favor
                    of just being another group amongst many in the island. This, in turn, produces un-
                    equal relations as any claims towards justice can be thwarted in the US legal system.
                    Multiculturalism, at its most basic level, can be defined as “the coexistence of people
                    with many cultural identities in a common state, society, or community” (Oxford
                    University Press, n.d.). Multiculturalism is often celebrated as a successful achieve-
                    ment of modern society and is presented as a victory against blatant racism. It has
                    made its way into policy and academia, with goals such as multicultural education
                    and keywords such as “diversity” being ubiquitous in corporate models. These
                    basic definitions and concepts are not the cause of consternation in this piece. The
                    presence of a diversity of cultures in Guam is not the cause of CHamoru erasure.
                    CHamorus were able to co-exist with other ethnic groups throughout history with-
                    out any serious threat to lina'la' CHamoru (CHamoru life). In the current political
                    environment, it is intellectually lazy to conflate Indigenous critiques of multicultur-
                    alism with xenophobia or Trump-era anti-immigrant discourse, and it is my hope
                    that this piece will help to distinguish these critiques from such xenophobic dis-
                    course. In making this distinction, I hope to underscore how settler colonial logics
                    utilize the discourse of multiculturalism towards erasure that is the onus of concern
                    here, and in doing so seek to erase indigeneity while maintaining unequal relations.
                    </p>

                <p>Elizabeth Povinelli (as cited in Saranillo, 2015) argues that “in modern liberal demo-
                    cratic societies, multiculturalism is a characteristic of settler colonialism” that often
                    creates “the conditions under which indigenous peoples are forced into a politics of
                    recognition and authenticity in order for their claims to not be disqualified” (p. 285).
                    To put it another way, in order for Indigenous peoples to actually make claims, they
                    often have to “prove” their authenticity or why they should be treated any differently
                    (similar to how Native American tribes petitioning for federal recognition must
                    submit paperwork showing cultural authenticity and continuity). This consistent
                    requirement of “proving” facilitates projects of erasure: failing to prove authenticity
                    can mean a rejection of either legal or discursive weight to their grievances, thus
                    enforcing unequal relations between the US government and Indigenous peoples.</p>

                <p>I argue that this exists in Guam today via a particular form of multiculturalism. As
                    Michael Lujan Bevacqua and I (2016) argue regarding multiculturalism in Guam,
                    </p>

                <p>
                        Despite this emphasis on equality or diversity, in truth all cultures are supposed
                        to respect and adhere to the dominance of a single, oftentimes invisible culture
                        that will act as the mediator, telling each culture what it is allowed to practice
                        and how much of its language should be spoken. This culture is dominant in
                        the way it does not provide particularity to the multicultural matrix, but instead
                        its particularity acts as the universal structure. (p. 262)
                    </p>

                <p>Thus, this understanding of multiculturalism is of a specific discourse that acts as an
                    “assimilationist machine” serving the militarized, territorial needs of empire.</p>

                <p>The danger of this circumstance is the subsequent minoritization of Indigenous
                    peoples, or in Guam's case, the positioning of CHamorus as just one amongst many.
                    Under this discourse, Indigenous peoples are presented as just another ethnic
                    group or race within the multicultural fabric of society. The condition of possibility
                    of erasure is the conflation of indigeneity with race or ethnicity. One of the most
                    cited definitions of Indigenous peoples can be found in a 1986 U.N. study by Special
                    Rapporteur Jose Martinez Cobo, where he defines Indigenous peoples as:</p>

                <p>
                        Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a his-
                        torical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed
                        on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the soci-
                        eties now prevailing in those territories or parts of them. They form at present
                        non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and
                        transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identi-
                        ty, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their
                        own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.
                    </p>

                <p>Per this definition, Indigenous is two-pronged: a long-established deep connection
                    to the land (predating historical displacement by other groups) and the existence
                    of an unjust social relationship usually as a result of colonialism or current state
                    repression—or both. Indigeneity is not race, and to conflate the two is to erase pros-
                    pects for self-determination and sovereignty.</p>

                <p>As Choctaw scholar Jodi Byrd (2011) writes on the role of minoritization, “Under
                    this paradigm, American Indian national assertions of sovereignty, self-determina-
                    tion, and land rights disappear into US territoriality as indigenous identity becomes
                    a racial identity and citizens of colonized indigenous nations become internal
                    ethnic minorities within the colonizing nation-state” (p. xxvi). Byrd argues that
                    when indigeneity becomes erased and Indigenous peoples are simply considered
                    ethnic minorities, their claims to self-determination are essentially erased. In this
                    framework, Indigenous peoples become just “one amongst many” ethnic groups
                    in a particular place. Indigenous struggles for sovereignty and rights are too easily
                    dismissed as either affirmative action policies or illegal, unfair practices.²³</p>

                <p>In Guam, one can find examples of this “one amongst many” discourse in which
                    CHamorus are represented as just another ethnic group in the island. I provide two
                    here. First, Dave Davis, introduced earlier, previously had a weekly column in the
                    <em>Marianas Variety</em>, a newspaper he used as a platform for anti-CHamoru sentiments.
                    In his anti-CHamoru writings, one catchphrase stands out: “Our Guam license plates
                    carry a logo translated as ‘Land of the Chamorro,' home to the ancient Chamorro
                    it certainly was, but that was then and this is now” (Davis, 2011). While not direct-
                    ly stating “multiculturalism,” his words would later come to life when he sued the
                    Government of Guam due to what he considered to be CHamorus discriminating
                    against non-CHamorus on the issue of the political status plebiscite.</p>

                <p>Second, in March of 2015, fellow CHamoru scholar Michael Lujan Bevacqua and
                    I organized “Ha'ånen Fino' Chamoru Ha',” a day in which we encouraged every-
                    one to speak in the CHamoru language as much as possible regardless of where
                    they were or what they were doing. There were close to 100 people who actively
                    participated and wrote about their experiences. While this event was a great push
                    for CHamoru language revitalization and led to many taking first steps to learn
                    the language, the discursive power of the logics of erasure were still inescapable.
                    In reflecting on their experiences of this event, some participants said they were
                    harassed by non-CHamorus for speaking CHamoru to them. In one particular in-
                    stance, a non-CHamoru waitress asked a CHamoru speaker ordering food, “Why
                    are you speaking that language? I don't understand, this is America” (M. Bevacqua,
                    personal communication, 2015). These examples display the friction and dissent-
                    ing views on where the CHamoru people, language, and culture fit within Guam
                    in this “modern time.”</p>

                <p>This discursive force of CHamoru erasure does not just stay in the realm of dis-
                    course. It also manifests itself through legal institutions and most recently in the
                    <em>Davis v. Guam</em> lawsuit through the instrumentalizing of individual voting rights and
                    the invocation of civil rights. Arnold “Dave” Davis is a White settler and retired Air
                    Force officer. He attempted to register for the Decolonization Registry, which was a
                    registry established by Guam Law 25-106, yet he was turned away because he did not
                    meet the criteria of being a native inhabitant (Leon Guerrero, 2014). In 2011, Davis
                    sued the Government of Guam, the Guam Election Commission and other related
                    parties, reasoning that he was being discriminated against because of his inability
                    to register for the Decolonization Registry and subsequently vote in the political status
                    plebiscite. His attorneys argued that this was a violation of the Voting Rights Act, the
                    Organic Act of Guam, and his Fifth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment rights.</p>

                <p><em>Breitbart</em>, the news hub of the alt-right movement, ran a piece on the Davis case that
                    stated, “Many of the territory's elected officials and anti-American activists are start-
                    ing to resemble the unabashed segregationists of the Old South of the 1950s. Think
                    of it as a Pacific Islander version of Plessy vs. Ferguson” (von Spakovsky andamp; Clegg, 2017).
                    The same lead author, in the conservative publication <em>National Review</em>, writes,</p>

                <p>
                        To base decisions on your ancestry when parceling out political power is anath-
                        ema to the 15th Amendment. It is the sort of vile evil that the Voting Rights Act
                        of 1965 rooted out. But it is alive and well on Guam and will continue unless
                        a federal judge finally acts to stop this modern, progressive “identity politics”
                        version of Jim Crow discrimination. (von Spakovsky, 2016)
                    </p>

                <p>One can see settler colonial logics at work here in aiming to preserve unequal rela-
                    tions as a method of ensuring access to land (even if not the intention), in the form
                    of retaining Guam's political status quo and the consequent military presence in the
                    island. This is a completely dehistoricized argument that does not take into account
                    Guam's complicated history, including the complete transformation of the island after
                    the war and the lack of CHamoru sovereignty. Further, by enforcing settler colonial
                    logics, CHamorus are positioned as “one amongst many” who want to disenfranchise
                    others. CHamoru subjectivity as colonized people is erased in these narratives.</p>

                <p>In laying bare the agenda of this lawsuit and countering this “Jim Crow” discourse,
                    we find that <em>Davis v. Guam</em> fits within a history of “reverse discrimination” that is
                    being used to thwart movements for Native, Black, and Latinx liberation. The boil-
                    erplate complaint is that White Americans are being discriminated against by any
                    program that seeks to serve non-White communities (even if these programs are
                    meant to right historical wrongs). This argument is strengthened when one looks at
                    Davis' legal representation, most especially the Center for Individual Rights, which
                    has helped dismantle affirmative action programs throughout US universities. For
                    example, in 1999, “the Center for Individual Rights launched a national campaign
                    urging students to sue their colleges for racial discrimination” (Flanders, 1999).
                    Furthermore, according to the Center for Individual Rights (n.d.), they have “brought
                    a series of high-profile cases designed to get the government out of the business of
                    classifying citizens by race.” The group calls this color-blindness. Color-blindness,
                    often seen as the antithesis to multiculturalism, attempts to erase racial differences
                    or celebration of these differences in favor of what advocates purport to be neutral
                    treatment of all. Thus, both multiculturalism and color-blindness can be used to-
                    wards Indigenous erasure, especially in the US legal system. The ties that bind them
                    is the conflation of CHamoru indigeneity with a simple racial designation.</p>

                <p>Judi Rohrer (2016) describes this particular use of the US legal system as a one-two
                    punch against Indigenous peoples. The first punch is to problematize collective
                    Native identity and the second punch is to naturalize White settler subjectivity via
                    a color-blind ideology (Rohrer, 2016). Lawsuits such as Davis' serve as camouflaged
                    attempts at usurping CHamoru self-determination. They present themselves as
                    advocating for justice and equality while supporting the existence of colonial struc-
                    tures. As argued by Serrano (2018),</p>

                <p>
                        This co-optation of civil rights tightly constrains the rights of Indigenous
                        peoples. It does so in part by discounting the history of colonization—the
                        confiscation of land, barring of language, suppression of identity, and loss of
                        self-governance—and its harsh present-day consequences. Once stripped of
                        this historical and modern-day context, “programs to uplift indigenous people
                        in their homeland [are] recast as simply wrong-headed ‘racial preferences.'”
                        Politically, the success of these coordinated reverse-discrimination legal chal-
                        lenges … threaten Indigenous efforts to restore a measure of self-determination
                        and self-government. (p. 510)
                    </p>

                <p>This is by far the scariest component of the picture. When self-determination is
                    wrongfully recast as just selfish racial preference, it can affect how others view the
                    issue and lead to the continuation of unequal relations between CHamorus and
                    the US military (via the US federal government) regarding the island's destiny. If
                    CHamoru self-determination is wrongfully recast as an inherently “exclusionary”
                    process, then the project of CHamoru erasure is easier to complete. Lastly, if this
                    thought process and discourse is enforced via the power of the colonial legal system,
                    then CHamoru erasure reaches a new pinnacle. Erasure can occur through the insti-
                    tutionalization of “equality” as seen in the Davis case. Davis would eventually go on
                    to win his case, and sadly many in Guam were not surprised. We know that the US
                    legal system is skewed against Indigenous peoples and unincorporated territories.
                    This form of CHamoru erasure is perhaps the most expected.</p>

                <p>The idea for this chapter came from asking myself two questions, “How does the
                    inability of a White settler, retired Air Force officer, to participate in a vote meant to
                    right the colonial wrongs of 400 years become conflated with the massive push by
                    African Americans to rid the shackles of slavery and participate fully in the society
                    they were forced to enter?” and “How does Guam history simply get erased to the
                    point where CHamorus can be viewed as just another ethnic group in the island?”
                    I use the guises of CHamoru erasure to better understand this. This erasure was
                    built on a material, physical transformation after the war and gains its strength
                    via a discourse of “one amongst many” which conflates indigeneity with race and
                    enforced via lawfare in US legal institutions. Settler colonial theory is a useful ana-
                    lytical frame in understanding all this physiology of erasure. Ending here, however,
                    leaves one unfulfilled and uncertain about the future. I turn to the final section for a
                    glimpse of something different.</p>

                <p><strong>Paving Other Paths (Warning Beacons and New Relationalities)</strong><br/>
                    It is my hope that this piece has two lasting effects. The first is to serve as a warn-
                    ing beacon to other Indigenous peoples. CHamoru erasure was not the result of a
                    single event or policy. Erasure takes many forms including physical, discursive, and
                    legal shapes, and many forms co-exist simultaneously. Thus, it is impossible to place
                    blame on any single factor, and not every factor was deliberately deployed to erase
                    CHamorus. In this chapter, I navigated the historical landscape from land-taking to
                    community discourse to lawsuits. My experience is indicative of the multi-faceted
                    work of tracking the elements of Indigenous erasure. Yet, the ramifications of failing
                    to track the emerging shapes of erasure are too great for us to fail. Indigenous peo-
                    ples must continue to work together on a multiscalar level (local, national, regional,
                    and international level) to share their stories and warn others of the forms erasure
                    took in their respective experiences, locales, and stories. Kanaka Maoli scholar,
                    Noelani Goodyear Kaʻōpua (2013) describes Indigenous as a category of alliance.
                    This alliance is critical, and I hope that the story of CHamoru erasure outlined here
                    can strengthen these intra-Indigenous alliances.</p>

                <p>The second hope I have for this piece is for it to serve as a discussion point for alterna-
                    tive forms of relationalities between CHamorus and non-CHamorus in Guam. <em>Davis
                    v. Guam</em> has shown how there are some in Guam who look at CHamoru self-deter-
                    mination as a zero-sum endeavor. For them, for CHamorus to self-determine or for
                    Guam to be decolonized, non-CHamorus must pay the costs. This manifests in vari-
                    ous ways, with non-CHamorus arguing that decolonization leads to marginalization
                    of non-CHamorus, or non-CHamorus being kicked off the island if Guam were to
                    decolonize. There are ways to move beyond this zero-sum depiction of CHamoru
                    self-determination, and I hope this piece becomes a part of that conversation. So,
                    even if it will be hard to change the legal elements or overcome the physical transfor-
                    mation, I ponder what courses of action the community can take. To put it another
                    way, is there a future for Guam in which CHamorus and non-CHamorus co-exist in
                    an affirmative way that holds the unfinished quest of CHamoru self-determination
                    as important? In many ways, this work has already begun.</p>

                <p>On June 28, 2013, “Beyond the Fence,” the local Public Radio Guam (KPRG) show,
                    aired a very interesting episode. It was entitled, “Ep. 151 Guam Filipinos in Support
                    of Chamorro Self-Determination.” According to the program host, the goal of this
                    particular show was to give airtime to those Filipinos who acknowledge they are
                    not eligible to vote in a possible political status plebiscite in Guam, and yet are still
                    supportive of Chamorro self-determination. The impetus for the show was the cel-
                    ebration of <em>Araw ng Kasarinlan</em>, or “Day of Freedom,” where Filipinos celebrate the
                    Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain. This day is celebrated in Guam
                    with various events held throughout the month allowing Filipinos to acknowledge
                    their political independence. The program hosts wanted Filipinos to think of their
                    role in relation to the CHamoru people and the CHamoru decolonization move-
                    ments. When I first heard this particular program, I knew there was something
                    special about it. The basic premise of this episode shows non-CHamorus being com-
                    pletely comfortable imagining a future for the island that does not neatly fit within
                    the political family of “America.” Furthermore, the guests were unabashedly vocal
                    that as non-CHamorus they would not be voting in the political status plebiscite and
                    that they completely understood why. They were the antidote to the Davis poison.</p>

                <p>Critical conversations between CHamorus and non-CHamorus on their respectful
                    responsibilities need to continue, and to be amplified and multiplied. Now more than
                    ever, we need new ways of connecting to one another. As Dean Saranillo (2015) notes,
                    “By taking seriously Indigenous knowledges and economies, we can create another
                    future, and in the creation of an alternative future, more space for mutual respect
                    can occur. Settler states have no interests in non-Natives identifying with Native
                    movements, as such identification opens our world to alternatives that the settler
                    state denies are possible” (p. 204). As CHamoru self-determination still needs to be
                    exercised, we have two futures ahead of us. The first is a continuation and exacerba-
                    tion of CHamoru erasure; the second is a decolonial future of new relations amongst
                    CHamorus and non-CHamorus in Guam. May this piece serve as one push towards
                    the latter. Erasure is not an acceptable outcome in the land of the CHamoru people.
                    I write this piece as one instrument of my resistance. As the visual expression of an
                    aggressive call from a mountaintop. A voice yelling, Ti Siña Ma Funas Ham. “They
                    Cannot Erase Us.”</p>

                <head>Language Change in Saipan: Attitudes and Visions (Dominique B. Hess)</head>

                <p>Saipan has experienced several foreign administrations over the past centuries:
                    the Spanish, German, Japanese, and finally the United States after World War II.
                    Amongst the many consequences of these political changes, these administrations
                    brought their own language to Saipan so that the island has been in close contact
                    with different languages for almost 350 years. Each of these foreign languages has left
                    its mark on the local languages at different linguistic and social levels. Here we ex-
                    amine the influence of English on the local community in Saipan and its emergence
                    as the dominant language on the island. Moreover, local Chamorro and Carolinian
                    speakers contribute their own perspectives towards the current language situation
                    and their visions for Saipan's linguistic future. The data used for this chapter are
                    taken from recorded conversations with the local community—a linguistic corpus
                    (a collection of written and spoken texts) collected in June-August 2015 containing
                    95 sociolinguistic interviews with Indigenous Chamorros and Carolinians ranging
                    in age from 12-79 years.²⁴</p>

                <p>Although different dialects of English were used by whalers, beachcombers, traders
                    and missionaries in the 19th century, the first significant incursion of English into the
                    Saipan community was when the Americans started administering the Northern
                    Mariana Islands in 1944. English started to be taught in school and was, and often
                    still is, seen as the language of educational possibilities, success, Westernization,
                    and access to a “New World.” According to a middle-aged male Chamorro speaker,
                    Sa47m34²⁵, “[t]he English language is the most important around the world. It's the
                    first language that people should [use to] communicate around the world because if
                    we don't communicate [in] English … how can we communicate?” Parents believe
                    that English is the key to giving their children the best possible future, and thus often
                    speak English at home and use the local languages less frequently. Consequently,
                    the emergence of English as a first language has been observed over the years. A
                    generational shift has been taking place, which has resulted in the younger genera-
                    tion speaking mostly in English with only a few of the younger population in Saipan
                    still speaking in their Native tongue. In fact, English is used equally or more often
                    than other languages at home by 59% of the population, whereas only 22% of the
                    population speak Chamorro and 5.6% Carolinian at home (CNMI Department of
                    Commerce, 2010, pp. 181–86).²⁶ Other intertwined and complex factors influence the
                    use of the English language: in particular, global movement has had a great impact
                    on the language situation in Saipan.</p>

                <p><strong>Global Movement and Saipan</strong><br/>
                    Global movement, in this chapter, is understood as human mobility into and out
                    of Saipan. Immigration—inward mobility—occurred as many guest workers en-
                    tered Saipan during the economic boom in the 1980s and 1990s when the garment
                    factories flourished (Farrell, 1991, pp. 648–649). Saipan turned into a multicultural
                    island. Japanese investors realized the opportunity for a holiday destination and
                    invested in tourism, resulting in the construction of hotels, restaurants, golf cours-
                    es, scuba-diving shops, and nightclubs, among many other recreational facilities.
                    According to Quimby (2016), 75% of the tourists (736,177) were Japanese. Due to the
                    lax immigration and labor regulations, as well as the business-friendly wage laws
                    in the CNMI, many guest workers made Saipan their home: Chinese workers were
                    primarily employed in the garment industry, Filipino workers in the tourism sector,
                    and only a small number of Chinese and Filipinos were employed in the construc-
                    tion sector and private households (Farrell, 1991, pp. 648–649; Quimby, 2016). Even as
                    Saipan experienced an economic and tourism decline after 2000 and many immi-
                    grants returned to their homelands, many long-term guest workers stayed in Saipan.
                    Moreover, due to new visa (Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program 2009) and airline
                    agreements (direct flights from Seoul as of 2006), tourism from Russia and South
                    Korea has been increasing, with Korea now one of the leading source markets for
                    the CNMI today (Camacho, 2015; US Customs and Border Protection, 2012; Horwath
                    HTL, 2017). Since 2012, there has also been a large increase in Chinese tourists and
                    immigrants. According to Horwath HTL (2017), “[a]s of the end of 2014, China took
                    over as the largest source market for the CNMI, accounting for 37% of total arrivals,
                    replacing the historically dominant player, Japan” (p. 9).</p>

                <p>Today, only 27% of the Saipan population are Indigenous Chamorros and
                    Carolinians, and the rest (73%) of the population are non-local: 36% Filipinos, 7%
                    Chinese, 5% Koreans, and 12% who have two or more ethnic origins, among many
                    other ethnicities that are represented in the CNMI to a smaller extent (CNMI
                    Department of Commerce, 2010, p. 41). The considerable number of immigrants
                    and tourists in the CNMI has had a significant impact on contemporary language
                    use. The increase in multiculturalism in Saipan has resulted in English being used
                    more and more as the lingua franca.²⁷ Topping (2003) nicely describes the language
                    contact situation as follows:
                    </p>

                <p>
                        In the Marianas, Chamorros talk to their Filipina maids in English. The maids
                        talk to the children in English. The children talk to the Korean or Chinese
                        shopkeepers in English. Japanese hotel managers on Guam and Saipan talk to
                        Palauan desk clerks in English. And so on. (p. 523)
                    </p>

                <p>Due to the economic downturn, starting in the late 1990s and lasting for about a
                    decade, many foreign workers and permanent residents left the island, and the pop-
                    ulation of the CNMI fell by 22% between 2002 and 2010 (Quimby, 2016). Despite this
                    mass emigration, the language situation did not change: children who had grown
                    accustomed to using English at home continue this practice today.</p>

                <p>Outward mobility surged, as many local people took the opportunity to go to the US
                    mainland. People mostly left for educational and work reasons, but also because of
                    family responsibilities or medical treatment. People who have spent several years
                    abroad, quite naturally, have accommodated²⁸ their English to the English varieties
                    spoken in North America and often speak English as a first language. McPhetres
                    (1992) comments thus on the outward mobility and its effect on the languages:
                    </p>

                <p>
                        Perhaps as many Chamorros are living in the US mainland as in the islands.
                        This out migration, particularly to Southern California, is fast assimilating
                        Chamorros into American culture. In fact, most educated (high school and col-
                        lege) Chamorros speak English to their children at home because this will help
                        them to get ahead. In many cases, Chamorro is spoken only in anger or chas-
                        tisement of the children. This is happening in the Marianas as well. A growing
                        number of local children are growing up with the idea that English is their first
                        language and Chamorro is something to swear in. (p. 263)
                    </p>

                <p>Clearly, people who have spent time in the US mainland are influenced by the English
                    dialects spoken there and are most likely to use English as their first language. In
                    some, if not most, cases this also holds true for families in the CNMI. A middle-aged
                    female Carolinian speaker, Sa54f43, confirms the language change in the CNMI after
                    returning from Hawai‘i, where she lived for 9 years: “Saipan has changed quite a
                    lot. It's more Americanized than when I first left. It may be a Carolinian house, a
                    Chamorro house or even a Filipino or Chinese house, and they speak English.”</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the influx of modern technology has also augmented the dominant
                    status of English on the island. Topping (1985) notes that “English is used in all radio
                    and TV broadcasting, local newspapers, and government publications” in the CNMI
                    (p. 128). Studies have demonstrated that media exposure leads to incidental foreign
                    language acquisition (Kuppens, 2010), an important consideration in the case of
                    Saipan when initially media only existed in the English language. Media, including
                    TV programs and commercials, are one of the strongest influences on the dominance
                    of English (Topping, 2003, p. 523). A young Chamorro speaker, Sa18m22, explains the
                    supremacy of English in the media: “kids are not going to sit there and watch the
                    older local figures speak about politics in a language that they don't completely un-
                    derstand … they're going to gravitate towards what's funny what's more interesting
                    and … that's Western culture.” Shigemoto (1997) was concerned about the decline
                    of the use of local languages and argued that the impact of American mass media is
                    noticeable on the island and that elements of the Western culture advance into local
                    culture: “[M]ass media are damaging to local languages because they have displaced
                    traditional pastimes, such as engaging in local crafts like canoe-building or listen-
                    ing to stories, which are transmitted through the indigenous languages” (p. 5). Her
                    concern is still valid today as the use of English has gained even greater popularity.
                    Since 2014, a 3G network has been available in Saipan and connects the island to
                    the rest of the world (Bagnol, 2014). The use of English has expanded via the inter-
                    net, including social media like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Netflix,
                    and dominates all other languages. A 17-year-old teenage Carolinian girl, Sa09f17,
                    confirmed the predominant usage of English. When I asked her “what about on
                    Facebook, is it all in English or do you use Carolinian?” she answered, “no, it's all
                    in English.” Hence, even people who have not been physically mobile in their lives
                    now have a high exposure to English spoken as a native language through various
                    types of media, which impacts their English language use remarkably.</p>

                <p>Due to this constant exposure to English over time, and especially since the late
                    1960s when the Peace Corps²⁹ started to arrive in Micronesia and the contact possi-
                    bilities between the local community and Americans increased (cf. Farrell, 1991, pp.
                    556–557), English is spoken in everyday life on the island.</p>

                <p><strong>Consequences of Globalization andamp; the Emergence of English as a Dominant Language</strong><br/>
                    The consequences of globalization, and especially global movement to and away from
                    Saipan, as well as the emergence of English as a dominant language, have led to so-
                    cial changes on the island. With the many long-term contract workers residing
                    in Saipan, the island society is increasingly multicultural. People of different ethnic
                    backgrounds live alongside each other and communicate, most typically through
                    English. The tension of diversity versus unity emerges and the question arises of how
                    traditional cultures and languages can survive in the future in such a context. An
                    elderly Chamorro woman, Sa62f73, clearly advocates cultural diversity and uses the
                    beautiful metaphor of a salad to describe the multicultural situation in Saipan:</p>

                <p>I look at it more of a salad. Yeah, that each of us, I'm a Chamorro, you are from
                    Switzerland, but we're all islanders, you know, we're all Saipanese, we're all
                    here trying to make this island the best island. We're not here to make it a little
                    Philippine and we're not here to make it a little Korea, we're not here to make
                    it a little China and a little, you know, we're here to make a nice island, yeah.
                    But see being a salad, I don't like to make it a melting pot because you lose
                    your identity. I don't want you to lose your identity. You should have them be-
                    cause that's what brings the richness and when you eat a salad each of them has
                    some different taste.</p>

                <p>This attitude of celebrating the existing cultural diversity in Saipan clearly is in
                    place and was observed for example during the Liberation Day Festivities in 2015
                    with the slogan “Peace in Diversity.” Nevertheless, the population of Saipan presents
                    a unity towards the outside and manages to overcome cultural tensions with a
                    united language—the English language.</p>

                <p>Some speakers are aware of the fact that for them English is more easily accessible
                    than their local language. Sa79f24 states, “I mean sometimes like, I would tell them
                    like I am proud of who I am but sometimes it's easier for me to communicate in
                    English than it is to communicate in Carolinian.” The younger generation especially
                    faces the challenge of being bilingual if not trilingual in Saipan and trying to remain
                    conversant in their local language. Sometimes if they do, however, they are made
                    fun of by their parents, as this young Carolinian girl, Sa09f17, stated: “[Y]eah [my
                    parents] would just look at me and give me some weird look where they're like, ‘why
                    you speaking to me like that [in Carolinian]?'” Not surprisingly, the younger genera-
                    tion, conversely, do ridicule their parents too when speaking in the local language, as
                    this middle-aged woman, Sa74f35, revealed: “[M]y kids make fun of my language, it's
                    mostly English.” The young Carolinian confirms that the language most often used
                    at home is English and is no longer the local language, as already discussed above.
                    Clearly, this issue of choosing English over the local languages is unidirectional.
                    Whatever reasons exist, English is the more frequently spoken language inside and
                    outside the home in local families, and consequently, it has become the easier lan-
                    guage to communicate in for some, and thus has emerged and been accepted as the
                    lingua franca in the community. Therefore, the question arises of what the future
                    of Saipan's multilingual language situation might hold and what visions the local
                    people of Saipan have for their island.</p>

                <p><strong>Language Vision</strong><br/>
                    The future of the language situation in Saipan is uncertain. According to Jourdan
                    and Salaün (2013), “[t]wo levels of linguistic tensions appear. First that which opposes
                    language unity vs. language diversity; young multilingual countries need language
                    unity to build a country out of diversity. Second that which opposes powerful inter-
                    national languages vs. small local languages” (p. 214). Good reasons clearly exist why
                    English as a shared language has emerged in the CNMI. As discussed earlier, some
                    local people strongly believe that English is going to be the only language spoken on
                    the island in the future.“I think in their [the younger] generation Carolinian is going
                    to erase. Everything is all English,” said Sa74f35.³⁰</p>

                <p>On the other hand, there are people who have a vision of a multilingual Saipan.
                    They advocate for diversity and support the local languages with school and cultur-
                    al programs. Children attend Chamorro or Carolinian Language Heritage Studies
                    (CCLHS) during school; to celebrate, recognize, and promote Chamorro and Saipan
                    Carolinian heritage, the month of September is the annual Cultural Heritage Month
                    in Saipan, that promotes traditional dances, art, and cooking among much more (cf.
                    Encinares, 2016). People want, furthermore, to promote Saipan's cultural and lin-
                    guistic diversity in the education system. Sa62f73 said, “On Saipan I'm not so sure a
                    bilingual approach is appropriate at this time; I think it's more of a multicultural and
                    a multilingual approach—not [a] bilingual anymore.” This is demonstrated in the
                    offer of various clubs in schools that promote cultural diversity, such as the Polksai
                    Chamorro Club, the Refaluwasch Culture Club³¹, the Filipino Club, or the Japanese
                    Club (Marianas High School, 2021).</p>

                <p>These tensions between language unity vs. diversity and global vs. local languages
                    contribute to language maintenance or language shift. Principal factors for language
                    maintenance or shift include “individual, family, community, and broader societal
                    factors” (Potowski, 2013, p. 322). On an individual level, if an intrinsic motivation
                    for learning and speaking the local languages by young speakers exists, such as by
                    this young Chamorro girl, Sa40f14, who stated “English is the main language here
                    especially in public but I like speaking Chamorro, it's fun,” then the survival of the
                    local languages being spoken on the island may be prolonged. Favoring bilingual-
                    ism or multilingualism and having a positive attitude towards the heritage language
                    is one step in the direction of language maintenance. For language maintenance to
                    succeed, however, more is needed than a positive attitude (Potowski, 2013, p. 323).
                    Fishman (2013) insists on the importance of transmitting a language from one gener-
                    ation to the next and understanding how this transmission is shaped socioculturally,
                    as a result of social, economic, and political experiences (pp. 468–469).</p>

                <p>The Indigenous languages spoken in Saipan are currently in a transitional phase
                    and are experiencing language shift. Ellis (2012) mentions two developments and
                    suggests that Chamorro and Carolinian are evolving into contemporary forms of the
                    local languages or a local variety of English, or both:
                    </p>

                <p>A document prepared for the CNMI State Education Agency Program (Buckley
                    1991) arrived at the conclusion that many indigenous children on Saipan were,
                    or were soon becoming, “semi-lingual” — they were not fluent in any language.
                    … The following year I suggested in a research proposal to the Public School
                    System (Ellis 1992) that Saipan children were not “semi-lingual.” Rather, they
                    were speaking a “transitional” form of Chamorro or SpnCRL [Saipan Carolinian]
                    moving towards either “a contemporary form of Chamorro/Carolinian” or “a
                    localized style of English,” and sometimes both. (pp. 352–353)</p>

                <p>Which direction the Indigenous languages will be taking, however, is still uncer-
                    tain. From the conversations I had with members of the local community during
                    my fieldwork and from the perspective of my research, I can only comment on the
                    emergence of a local variety of English (cf. Hess, in press). The English spoken in
                    Saipan is indeed developing its own character. The localized style of English, how-
                    ever, is socially conditioned by, for example, whether local speakers have positive
                    attitudes towards the English language, have spent several years abroad in the US
                    mainland, what educational background speakers have had, or their level of expo-
                    sure to English media. One possible vision for the language outcome is the mixing
                    of English and the Native languages. This mixing of languages is slowly but surely
                    occurring among the younger generation, as a middle-aged female speaker, Sa54f43,
                    explains that “The English language also is added into the speech of our young ones.
                    It's really, really funny sometimes when you, when you're talking to them because
                    they're using Chamorro, English and Carolinian in one sentence, you know. Yeah,
                    they're mixing it all up.” A young Carolinian girl, Sa79f24, also commented on the
                    mixing of the languages and called it the “Saipanese way.” She states,
                    </p>

                <p>
                        I have some co-workers you know they're like local too so like we speak this,
                        uhm, local English and I don't know if you ever heard of it. It's like where we
                        mix like our local words and English like I don't know it's confusing … It's
                        English but then it's just like the local way of talking English that's how I'd say
                        it the Saipanese way.
                    </p>

                <p>In this sense, the people of Saipan try to make the English language their own and
                    adapt it into their specific culture to fit its purpose for the local community. The English
                    spoken in Saipan is “Saipanese English” and has its own distinctive local “flavor” to it.
                    Clearly, languages are dynamic and ever-changing. Saipan has been in close con-
                    tact with different languages since the Spanish first set foot on the island, and its
                    languages continued to be impacted by the languages of the different administra-
                    tions, by the languages chosen for education, by globalization and especially global
                    movement into and out of Saipan, as well as media exposure nowadays. This has
                    had a considerable effect on the language situation in Saipan, whereby the English
                    language has become more and more the dominant language both inside and out-
                    side of the home. Linguistic visions of English being the dominant language exist
                    along with efforts at promoting the local languages. Currently, the local languages
                    and English are in a transitional phase and are undergoing language change. It is
                    hard to predict what path a language, or in this case languages, is taking; however,
                    the vision of a “Saipanese way” of speaking English, a localized variety of English,
                    may be a reality very soon. Languages are what people make of them, shaping them
                    in a way that reflects their history and their identity. We can only speculate on the
                    future of the languages spoken in Saipan, their ongoing development, their main-
                    tenance, shift or loss, or their spread to speakers of other ethnicities and, thus, who
                    will be speaking them in the future.</p>

                <head>What Saved Me (Victoria-Lola M. Leon Guerrero)</head>

                <p>Author Note: While this essay is based on real events, some names were changed.</p>

                <p>When I was five, I would venture outside every evening at six. We had a big kamachili
                    tree in our front yard, and I would run to it, excited to play with my “friends” as I had
                    called them. I remember the scene—the red-orange hue of the sky as the last rays of sun
                    peaked through the tree's canopy and the mystic glow around me. It was magical. My
                    favorite time of day. Until my mom realized what I had been doing.</p>

                <p>“Toya, come back inside. It's after six,” she said quietly, bending down to take my
                    hands and pull me up. “You know the taotaomo'na come out at six. You're not supposed
                    to be out here.”</p>

                <p>I quietly followed her into the house, feeling a deep sadness as I looked back to the
                    tree. The next day, ignoring what my mom had said, I made for the door at sunset,
                    but this time, my mom followed quickly.</p>

                <p>“Where are you going, Toya? It's six. It's time to stay inside. Come help me in the
                    kitchen.”<br/>
                    “But Mama, my friends are going to miss me.”<br/>
                    “What friends?”<br/>
                    “My friends at the kamachili tree. They're calling me outside to play.”<br/>
                    “No, Toya, it's not time to play anymore. Let's go finish making dinner.”</p>

                <p>As I followed my mom to the kitchen, my ears started ringing and an intense heat
                    coursed through my body. I stopped walking. “Mama,” I said, “I don't feel good.”</p>

                <p>“Oh Toya, you're so pale!” my mom exclaimed when she turned to look at me. She felt
                    my forehead and said I was burning up. She carried me into my room, placed me on
                    my bed and told me to rest while she got me some water and medicine. I fell into a deep
                    sleep. The next morning, my fever was gone, but my mom kept me home from school.
                    She watched me closely all day, but I was perfectly healthy.</p>

                <p>“Mama, can I go outside?” I asked while standing at the screen door staring at the
                    kamachili tree.<br/>
                    “No, Toya, it's getting late.”<br/>
                    “Please mama,” I pleaded.<br/>
                    “No.”</p>

                <p>I made my way to the living room, and my ears started to ring again. I collapsed onto
                    the couch and began to sob.</p>

                <p>“What's wrong?” My mom asked, rushing over.<br/>
                    “I don't feel good, mama.”<br/>
                    “Oh, baby, you're burning up again. I'm going to take you to the doctor.”</p>

                <p>When we got to the clinic, the doctor in urgent care could not figure out why my
                    fever was so high. He sent us back home and told me to rest and drink a lot of water.
                    My mom called my grandma, and she instantly knew what was wrong.</p>

                <p>“They're making her sick,” she told my mom, “because you're keeping her away from
                    them. I'll call Maman Rosa.”</p>

                <p>Grandma Chilang's cousin Maman Rosa was a suruhåna, a traditional healer, and
                    grandma always called her when she was sick. She would bring åmot—dark brown
                    teas, leaves, roots, bottles of oil, whatever the sickness called for. Grandma told her
                    what was happening to me, and she said she would meet us the next day at 6 p.m.
                    under the kamachili tree.</p>

                <p>I stayed home from school again and was feeling well the entire day. At 5:45 that
                    evening, my mom and I went outside to sit with grandma in front of the house and
                    wait for Maman Rosa. She arrived just before six with a bottle of oil and a bundle of
                    dried palm leaves that had been blessed at the church on Palm Sunday. We all headed
                    to the tree. Feeling free again, I started to run ahead of them.</p>

                <p>“Slow down, Toya. Come back,” my mom called after me.<br/>
                    “Polu ha',” Maman Rosa said, telling my mom to let me go.</p>

                <p>Maman Rosa placed a woven mat on the earth beneath the tree and called me to lie
                    down. She placed my head in her lap and gently massaged oil into my temples and
                    between my eyes. Then she softly closed my eyes, removed my head from her lap and
                    placed it on the mat. I felt a stillness in the air, and the evening bustle of the chickens
                    and dogs in our yard started to fade. First I could smell flowers. Musky ylang ylang
                    wafted above me followed by the thick scent of smoke coming in and out of my nos-
                    trils. I opened my eyes to see Maman Rosa walking around me. She had lit the tips
                    of the palm leaves with fire and held the bundle together like a wand that she moved
                    in circular motions above my body and up toward the tree, creating patterns of smoke.
                    Her lips moved quickly as she chanted prayers in CHamoru. I closed my eyes again
                    and must have drifted off to sleep, because the next thing I remember was being lifted
                    to sit up and Maman Rosa placing the crucifix at the end of her rosary beads in between
                    my eyes, to my lips for me to kiss and then to my heart.</p>

                <p>“Maolek,” she said. “Sen malak na palao'an hao.”</p>

                <p>She pulled me into a deep embrace and sniffed the top of my head. My mom also
                    gave me a hug, and my grandma told me that everything was going to be OK. Maman
                    Rosa started talking to them in CHamoru, explaining that there were spirits in the tree
                    who had taken a liking to me. Some of them were children themselves, and they had
                    just wanted to play. She said I was a very bright child, and they had been calling me to
                    them for a while. It was only because my mom had been keeping me from them that
                    they were making me sick. She had used the palm leaves to bless the area and said I
                    would not be bothered anymore.</p>

                <p>“They're not bad spirits,” I remember my grandma saying. “They just really like you.
                    But you cannot live in their world, because we need you here.”</p>

                <p>I never had a sense that the taotaomo'na were bad. I knew they were the spirits of
                    my ancestors. Like me, they enjoyed the beauty of our island, and they liked to have
                    fun outside. But after getting sick, I was more cautious. When I would go outside at
                    night, I would be very quick and quiet. If I had to throw out the trash or take clothes
                    from the line and the sun was already down, I would rush to complete my chore
                    and dash back into the house. It was not exactly fear, as much as respect for their
                    time and space. I did not want to intrude. As I got older, I learned how to recog-
                    nize their presence and show respect without having to flee. When a sudden wind
                    would rustle the dried leaves in the jungle, or the scent of ylang ylang would waft
                    by my nose at night, or a feeling deep in the pit of my stomach would stop me in my
                    tracks as I crossed certain trees, I knew they were there. And I would just offer a little
                    prayer, send them love and carry on.</p>

                <p>In my family there are many taotaomo'na stories, and often when someone falls ill or
                    is the victim of an unexpected or early death, there is always a theory that connects
                    their misfortune to having been disrespectful to the taotaomo'na. In one of the worst
                    accidents of our family's history, my Uncle Billy fell from the second story balcony of
                    his home while peeing over the ledge in the middle of the night. My grandpa's sister
                    strongly believes that he was knocked over by a taotaomo'na, who had been passing
                    through the jungle surrounding the house at that very moment. She said the house
                    was on the path that the spirits traveled to get from the jungle to the ocean and back,
                    and that as they were returning to the jungle, he must have accidentally peed on one
                    of them, upsetting the taotaomo'na enough to push him off. My beloved uncle did
                    not survive that fall, and after his death the house had to be blessed with holy water
                    from the Catholic Church to ensure his spirit would be set free. Just a few feet away
                    from where he landed, there is a shrine to the Virgin Mary.</p>

                <p>This juxtaposition of faith—our Indigenous belief in ancestral veneration and our
                    Catholic belief in God and Mother Mary—was how I had come to know spirituality.
                    I was taught to ask permission from my ancestors before entering the jungle, and
                    told to wear religious medals to keep bad spirits away. But as I grew older, I often
                    found myself caught in the middle of these two worlds, trying to find exactly where
                    I fit and wondering what to believe.</p>

                <p>When I was pregnant with my first child, my family scolded me because I broke all
                    the rules. Pregnant women are not supposed to go into the jungle or areas where
                    there is a high concentration of taotaomo'na. But I had gone hiking to the ancient
                    village of Pågat and walked in the jungles of Luta, singing love songs and visiting
                    latte. My friends in Luta taught me how to protect my womb with lada' leaves from
                    the noni tree. I had always asked for permission and followed my instincts, but it did
                    not matter. I should not have been there in the first place, my parents would tell me.
                    They said I traveled too much while I was pregnant. I flew to Saipan and Tinian, to
                    Japan and Okinawa. My cousin said I was “too active” and should not have raised my
                    voice so passionately when I was protesting the prospect of a firing range at Pågat.
                    Driven by the life growing inside of me, I believed that I could not be silent about
                    injustice, because I was becoming a mother.</p>

                <p>I carried my son safely in my womb until he was born, but when he entered this
                    world, I could not protect him any longer. He was born with a birth defect and was
                    rushed away from me and into an operating room. After surviving four hours of sur-
                    gery and then four more hours fighting for his life, Sai died in my arms. It was by far
                    the worst tragedy of my life. I had never felt so lost. So trapped in my fears. So guilty.
                    I had become unrecognizable in my grief, and my family was deeply worried. They
                    feared I had upset a taotaomo'na while I was pregnant and that I might still be sick.</p>

                <p>My husband Josh and I went from being the couple dancing in the front row of a
                    concert to people who went grocery shopping in the middle of the night to avoid
                    running into people we knew. Even though we had been showered with love and
                    support in our loss, we really wanted to be alone. And more than anything, we
                    became desperate for answers. One day, a couple of months after we lost Sai, my
                    Auntie Cil called from Saipan and asked if I wanted to visit a suruhånu that she
                    really trusted to help me figure out what had happened.</p>

                <p>“He's the best, Nen,” she said. “He can communicate with taotaomoʼna from all of
                    our islands. Since you went to Luta and Tinian, he may be able to tell you if some-
                    thing happened there and that way if you need to go back to apologize, you can.”
                    “OK, Auntie Cil, can we come next week?”<br/>
                    “Of course, Nen, any time. You can come stay with us. I will bring you to him.”</p>

                <p>Josh and I booked a ticket to Saipan right away, certain that this was the right thing
                    to do. When we got there, we spent our first day reconnecting with family and vis-
                    iting the graves of my grandparents and Uncle Billy. We had dinner at Auntie Mel's
                    house, and it was so comforting to be around her. Auntie Mel had come to Guam for
                    Sai's funeral and was there for me in a way no one else could be. She had lost two of
                    her own babies and talked me through the motions of burying mine—something I
                    had never imagined having to do.</p>

                <p>“You have to be the one to dress him,” she had encouraged me on the day of the
                    funeral. “This is your only chance to dress your son. Take your time. Look at his
                    body. Kiss him. Love him. You don't ever want to look back on this day and wish you
                    had taken more time to look at him. Study his face, so you'll never forget it.” And
                    she had stood by my side the entire time as I put on his tiny, white clothes. Seeing
                    her in Saipan for the first time since that day made me feel safe. I did not have to
                    tell her what the last few months had been like. She already knew. I did not have to
                    ask her about what to expect with the suruhånu the next day, she dove right into the
                    conversation. “I know you might be worried about what Harold's going to say to you
                    tomorrow, but it's OK. You have to trust him. You need to know what happened. It's
                    time you found out. And Harold, he'll be able to tell you. You won't even have to tell
                    him why you're there. He'll already know.”</p>

                <p>She then shared a story I had never been told about Uncle Billy. One time, he had
                    gotten really sick after fishing at night. An animan tåsi had followed him home.
                    These spirits of the ocean are known to be the most powerful spirits. That night
                    when he was sleeping, his entire body went numb. He lost feeling from his toes all
                    the way up to his head. He could not move at all. He said he felt like someone was
                    choking him, but he could not lift his arms to stop it. He tried to scream for help, but
                    no sound would escape his mouth. He had to just lay there for hours until it went
                    away. This happened to him every night after that, and our family members kept
                    telling him to go see Harold, but he was too proud. He said the taotaomo'na liked
                    him. They had always led him to the best fish at night. He did not need anyone's
                    help, he said. But one night, when he was playing cards at my cousin Sus's apart-
                    ment, his legs started to go numb. Sus asked him why he had not gone to see Harold
                    yet, and Uncle Billy joked that if Harold was so good at reading minds, why had he
                    not come to see him yet. A few minutes later, they saw a shadow passing the window
                    and then heard a knock at the door. “Håfa, Billy-Bert, you called me?” Harold said
                    through the door, and Uncle Billy nearly lost it. He rushed to the door and let Harold
                    in. It took three days, but Harold made the animan tåsi go away.</p>

                <p>Auntie Mel and I talked at the kitchen table for a few hours like this, sharing taotao-
                    mo'na stories, memories of Uncle Billy, whose loss was still so fresh in our family (it
                    had only been a year since his unexpected death), and catching up on news of all
                    of our relatives in Saipan and Guam. I was feeling much more like myself and was
                    ready to meet Harold the next morning.</p>

                <p>Auntie Cil drove us to a mint-green house with a vibrant garden in front of it. Hibiscus
                    of every hue, puti tai nobiu, plumeria and orchids bloomed colorfully. Harold was
                    waiting for us at the front of the house. “Maila,” he called to us in CHamoru. “Come
                    in.” I took his hand to ningnge' him, and Josh did the same. He felt like an old friend.
                    Like I had known him in my childhood, and we could just pick up where we had left
                    off despite not having seen each other in a long time. His brown skin was tight
                    and youthful. His eyes were those of a man in his 40s, but his hair was completely
                    white like a chungi bird. It was still shiny and thick, but all white. And his hands
                    were wrinkled with an age beyond this lifetime. I could tell that Harold's hands had
                    absorbed the sickness and pain of countless people, my relatives included.</p>

                <p>There were a lot of roosters around the house. Some were in the back yard, tied at the
                    ankle to a leash rooted in the earth; others were in cages. “Are those your birds?” I asked.</p>

                <p>“No, my brother's. Let's go over here.” He motioned us toward a bench on the side of
                    the house shaded by an ylang ylang tree. Josh and I sat on the bench, and Auntie Cil
                    stayed at the front of the house. I could smell the ylang ylang. The scent shot to my
                    gut, and it was wrenching. Did I want to know what he was going to tell me? Would
                    he tell me that I had done something wrong? That I had hurt my baby? Josh held my
                    hand, and Harold stood in front of me with a bottle of oil. I closed my eyes sensing
                    this was what he wanted me to do and tried to listen to him, but all I could hear were
                    the roosters and my fears playing over and over in my mind. Harold rubbed the oil
                    on my forehead and rested his palm over my third eye—the space of inner vision
                    between my eyes. The roosters faded to silence, and the scent of ylang ylang grew
                    stronger. The silence was absolute and lasted for several minutes. It filled me with
                    the same calm I had felt with Maman Rosa at the kamachili tree. Just as I started to
                    remember her, Harold spoke.</p>

                <p>“A spirit wanted your baby,” he told me. “She is a woman, not much older than you.
                    I can see you through her eyes. You are at the University of Guam, and you are rushing.
                    You go from the parking lot to the Field House. You cross the street diagonally, do you
                    remember this? There is a big tree there, do you know which one I am talking about?
                    The trongkon nunu?”</p>

                <p>“Hunggan. I know exactly which one you are talking about. I remember that day. I
                    teach there, and I was going to turn in my grades. I was so excited the semester was
                    over that I practically ran into the records office in the Field House.”</p>

                <p>“As you pass the tree, you bump into her, the spirit. She is very sad, but when she sees
                    you and your baby inside you, she feels happy. She wants your baby … she says your
                    baby is beautiful, so beautiful. Was she a girl?”</p>

                <p>“No, a boy.”</p>

                <p>“He is a beautiful boy. Has very feminine features, a … a woman's energy. She sees
                    your baby, and she sees you, how happy you are, and she wants what you have.
                    She could never have children. Her whole life all she wanted was a child, and she
                    couldn't have one. She doesn't mean to hurt you, but when she sees you, she thinks
                    this is her chance. She tries to enter you, to take your child. You felt it … when she
                    bumped into you, she says you felt it. Do you remember?”</p>

                <p>“I do. I … felt something that day. I even stopped and said, ‘Dispensa yu',' because I
                    didn't ask permission to pass under the trongkon nunu. I felt something brush me,
                    like a strong wind. I got cold, fugu', and just stopped in the middle of the street.”</p>

                <p>“Your baby felt it, too. The lady tried to take him, but she couldn't. And that struggle
                    is why your baby didn't form all the way. But God won. He let you have your baby.
                    You got to see him, right? You got to meet him, and hold him? God let you have that.”</p>

                <p>I was silent, but my thoughts were racing. God won? God and a spirit woman went
                    to battle for my baby? Why did I not know about it? Why was I not allowed to fight
                    for his life? It all sounded so crazy. So unfair.</p>

                <p>Harold's hand was still on my forehead. My eyes were still closed, and I was floating
                    somewhere between his bench and that trongkon nunu. For a moment, I was there,
                    at the trongkon nunu on that day. I remembered what it felt like to be pregnant. How
                    that morning I had looked in the mirror and saw a pregnant me staring back with a
                    newly stretched belly and fuller breasts. She was the most beautiful me I had ever
                    seen. And I really was happy. I wanted to stay there, in the memory of that day, and
                    slow down. Take the front entrance to the Field House and not the one next to the
                    trongkon nunu. Would that have changed Sai's fate?</p>

                <p>“It was not your fault,” Harold said, bringing me back to the bench.<br/>
                    “But I shouldn't have walked that way.”</p>

                <p>“There's nothing you could have done. Your baby was not meant to be part of this
                    world. I know you have heard this before, and you think it's just what people say,
                    but it's true. When I look at your baby now, I can see that he was meant for some-
                    thing greater. He was not really a boy or a girl, but something more. I just see
                    brightness. God won.”</p>

                <p>Fuck God, I thought, but could not say it out loud.</p>

                <p>Harold removed his hand from my forehead. The oil traveled slowly down the
                    bridge of my nose, over my lips, and dripped into my shirt. My breasts, still full of
                    milk for Sai, felt the cold tingle as the oil settled between them. If he was not meant
                    for this life, why had they still been so full?</p>

                <p>“Harold, I'm scared of what you saw. I'm angry with God. I … I don't know if I
                    believe in God anymore. I believe in what you saw. You had no way of knowing that
                    I walked into the Field House that day, or how I crossed the street, so I believe you,
                    but I am struggling to accept this idea that God won and that I am supposed to
                    be happy with that.”</p>

                <p>“You can believe whatever you want to believe. I am just telling you what they're
                    telling me.”<br/>
                    “Saina ma'åse, Harold, I appreciate everything you have done for me today.”<br/>
                    “It's Si Yu'os ma'åse, hagå-hu. Why do you people from Guam always
                    like to change things?”<br/>
                    “Ai, dispensa yu'. Si Yu'os ma'åse, Harold.”</p>

                <p>“You have a gift, too. I can tell. If you listened, if you really listened, you could hear
                    them, too. They like you.”<br/>
                    “I've been told that before, that the taotaomoʼna like me. Why?”<br/>
                    “There's something about you … you just need to listen, and you'll hear them. Don't
                    wipe the oil off your body, OK? Leave it on until you wake up tomorrow.”<br/>
                    “OK.”</p>

                <p>We said good-bye, and the next day Josh and I flew back to Guam. I struggled for
                    truth, for meaning in Harold's vision, and it made me frantic. Obsessive. I replayed
                    both the moment I had crossed the street that day and my visit with Harold over
                    and over again. I did not feel at peace, knowing that my baby was now with God.
                    Instead, I kept digging for more answers. Josh and I looked up what was happening
                    in my womb on the day I had passed that trongkon nunu. I looked in my email, saw
                    that grades were due the third week of May. I started counting weeks in my mind.
                    I would have been thirteen weeks pregnant. I typed “when does a baby's intestines
                    form?” into a search engine. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Thirteen weeks into
                    your pregnancy, or 11 weeks after conception, your baby's intestines have returned to
                    his or her abdomen from the umbilical cord … ”</p>

                <p>Sai's intestines had never returned to his abdomen. That was what went wrong,
                    biologically. His intestines had grown outside of his body in a sac called an om-
                    phalocele. I was speechless. This spirit's struggle to take my baby could really have
                    done this, metaphysically. It was the exact week. I looked over at Josh, who was read-
                    ing with me, and his furrowed brow suggested that he, too, was teetering between
                    reality and fantasy in his mind. We had genuinely believed that our baby would
                    survive. Even when I felt his breath leave his body, I could not accept that it was real.
                    I held on to him for nearly two hours afterwards. Carrying him close to my chest,
                    hoping that my heart would wake him. But he never came back, and I could not
                    understand why. After months of searching for a reason, we finally had one, and I
                    didn't know how to believe it, even though everything I had learned from my elders
                    told me that I should.</p>

                <p>In our culture, we do not question our elders or their beliefs. We listen to them and
                    respect them, like we have always been taught to respect the taotaomo'na, our first
                    elders. It was easy for me to understand the woman who wanted Sai. To compre-
                    hend her desire for a baby, because after losing him, it was all I wanted, too. But to
                    accept that this was God's plan, as my elders were telling me, was a challenge. Why
                    would God cause us such pain? Why would God give us a baby we could not keep?
                    Just as I was raised not to question my elders, they were raised not to question God.
                    Even though they had deep respect for the taotaomo'na, their ultimate faith was
                    always their belief in God and the teachings of the Church. But I could not reconcile
                    with God no matter how hard I tried. Not even for my mom, who kept inviting me to
                    church even though I would not go.</p>

                <p>The turning point in my faith was not just about what had happened to Sai. It had
                    been coming for a while. I had been a devout Catholic growing up—I had received
                    my sacraments and attended eskuelan påle', or Sunday school, every year until I
                    was confirmed. I looked forward to Mass and seeing everyone from my village there.
                    But as I became an adult, I dug more deeply into my history as a CHamoru woman.
                    I read about the CHamoru-Spanish Wars and the violence and manipulation that
                    were used to convert and colonize my ancestors. I felt one of my best friend's pain
                    when her mother turned her away and disowned her for loving a woman, because
                    as a Catholic, she truly believed her daughter was going to hell. I cringed every time
                    I read about a child who had trusted a priest and was abused by him and then aban-
                    doned, left to suffer with this wound in silence. Over time, I found it harder to attend
                    Mass without questioning the prayers or struggling through the priest's homily. I
                    would leave the church feeling very sad. Thus, instead of turning to the Catholic
                    faith during my time of need, I turned away from it.</p>

                <p>I have never stopped praying, but my prayers are no longer the rote prayers of my
                    childhood. Instead, they have become very personal and conversational, full of grat-
                    itude to our Creator, acceptance for all of life's lessons and praise to the ancestors
                    who carved a trail for me to follow. My spiritual life has become very personal. I find
                    myself in the jungle more, wanting to feel connected to the spirits there. I listen to
                    them more deeply, as Harold had advised, and I can hear them in ways I had not
                    before. Tracing their footsteps deeper into the halom tåno, I have found the freedom
                    I had felt as a child running to the kamachili tree. And that is truly what saved me.</p>

                <head>Contemporary Dynamics of Traditional Healing in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Tricia Lizama)</head>

                <p>In 2008 or thereabouts, I was faced with the daunting task of choosing a dissertation
                    topic. Critical to this reflection process was selecting a topic that would contribute to
                    the literature on the CHamoru people. As a young child, I grew up with a grandma
                    who always had a type of tea or chå brewing on the stove top and then later stored in
                    the refrigerator. Her brews served as a remedy for colds, congestion, and the flu, but
                    the “why” or “what was in the chå” was never understood. Nånan Biha (Grandma)
                    said that those who were born breech were recognized as “having good hands.” My
                    grandma gave me directions for massaging young babies and children due to my
                    “having good hands,” but no other explanation as to “why” was offered.</p>

                <p>When my aunt became ill, she was taken to a healer and “diagnosed” with having a
                    spiritual sickness. Many of these experiences and the unanswered “whys” became
                    the impetus for choosing a dissertation topic. The dissertation became the means
                    of resolving these unanswered questions. On this journey, I met many healers and
                    interviewed at least 40 healers in Guam, Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. The interviews
                    lasted between 2 and 4 hours each, and many of the healers had such a wealth of
                    information that subsequent visits with them were arranged. Through these inter-
                    views and the relationships established with the healers, many of the “whys,” along
                    with the whom, what, and when, were answered. I share a glimpse of the worldview
                    of the Mariana Islands healer in this chapter. In addition, I provide an exploratory
                    overview of the current state of traditional healing in the Marianas. The chapter
                    concludes with a consideration of the future of traditional healing in the region.</p>

                <p><strong>Literature Review</strong><br/>
                    Many studies have documented traditional healing in the Commonwealth of the
                    Northern Marianas (CNMI) and Guam. Although Guam and the Mariana Islands
                    have varied colonial histories, they share the same cultural history and practices.
                    The main function of the Native healers of the CHamoru and Carolinian people, the
                    suruhåna or suruhånu, was (and still is) to promote good health within the commu-
                    nity, which will in turn enhance the survival potential of the population (McMakin,
                    1978). The assumption driving the promotion of good health is that without good
                    health, other forms of cultural activities will be affected. Many of the statements
                    below are examples of how important and valued the role of a traditional healer was
                    and still is. Thompson (1947), writing about the art of being a suruhåna or suruhånu,
                    stated that due to colonization,</p>

                <p>already much has disappeared, and if the remainder is not recorded before the
                    present generation of herb specialists dies out, an important survival of ancient
                    Chamorro culture will probably be lost—a survival which, upon scientific in-
                    vestigation, may yield results valuable to modern medicine. (p. 198)</p>

                <p>McMakin (1978) noted in his anthropological study of the suruhåna/u that the craft
                    of being a suruhåna/u was “the most intact survival of a cultural activity of the
                    pre-contact Chamorro” (p. 14). McMakin (1978) further stated that the use of tradi-
                    tional medicine in Guam has persisted through time due to the continued demand
                    for the practice. Workman, Cruz-Ortiz, and Kamminga-Quinata (1994) also con-
                    firmed through their interviews of 33 people that the Indigenous practice of healing
                    and curing with herbs has survived. Lizama (2011) conducted her dissertation on
                    preserving and perpetuating traditional healing practices in modern Guam. Lizama
                    conducted a qualitative study and interviewed 11 traditional healers. In her findings,
                    all of the healers were practicing and valued the importance of their knowledge
                    and passing it on. These authors show that throughout Guam's history, traditional
                    healers have been an important component to health care in Guam. This statement
                    is also true for the CNMI.</p>

                <p>In order to recognize the practice of traditional healers in the CNMI, Borja and
                    Roppul (2009) published the <em>Directory of Traditional Healers and Medicinal Plants in
                    the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands</em>. Borja and Roppul were able to
                    interview and document 45 CHamoru and Carolinian healers. They noted in the bi-
                    ography compiled for each of these 45 healers that each was able to apprentice with
                    another healer before practicing on their own. Borja and Roppul's compilation of the
                    45 healers into a directory is significant as it is a way of preserving and perpetuating
                    the knowledge that these healers have, and this effort of compiling a directory was
                    the first of its kind. Furthermore, Demapan (2011) conducted an ethnographic study
                    focusing on exploring the contemporary medical practices of traditional healers in
                    the CNMI. Demapan used the healers from the <em>Directory of Traditional Healers and
                    Medicinal Plants</em> in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to find
                    her study subjects. Although only 12 of the healers met the criteria for her study,
                    Demapan was able to conclude the following: 1) traditional healer candidates have
                    to be interested and have to be recognized as being a potential healer; 2) most tradi-
                    tional healers said they treated a range of sicknesses including physical, psychological,
                    and spiritual sickness; and 3) the primary role as a suruhånu and suruhåna is to treat
                    the sick and to be a helping member of the community. In addition, a qualitative study
                    by J.E.H. Arriola (2009) focused on exploring and constructing the CHamoru episte-
                    mology of mental health. Arriola constructed the CHamoru epistemology of cultural
                    values and developed a theoretical model called “I Sisteman Nuebo yan I Tiempon
                    Antes” (The New System and Old Times), to explain the CHamoru epistemology of
                    mental health. Through his model, Arriola was able to identify the suruhånu and
                    suruhåna as cultural figures who have a very important role in preventing and treat-
                    ing the dysfunctional imbalances of a person. M. Arriola (2015) conducted a study
                    entitled “Patients' Perspectives on Indigenous Health Care Received from Suruhånas
                    and Suruhånus on the Pacific Island of Saipan.” One of her conclusions from this
                    study was that traditional healing is still being used by many people in Saipan. In
                    addition, another conclusion via her participant interviews was that traditional heal-
                    ers are perceived as prominent cultural figures who continue to play a vital role as
                    helpers and healers in the community. We can conclude from this literature that the
                    role of traditional healers in Guam and in the CNMI is a very important one and is
                    being preserved and documented (J. E. H. Arriola, 2009; M. Arriola, 2015; Borja andamp;
                    Roppul, 2009; Demapan, 2011; Lizama, 2011; McMakin, 1978; Thompson, 1947;
                    Workman et al., 1994). These various studies have documented that the people of
                    the CNMI and Guam continue to seek out services from suruhånu or suruhåna for
                    the diagnosis and treatment of minor ailments, spiritual ailments, and chronic disease.</p>

                <p><strong>History of Traditional Healing</strong><br/>
                    Traditional healing practices, particularly the use of herbal medicine, have been
                    used in the CNMI and Guam for centuries. In the CNMI, the traditional healer is
                    known as the suruhånu (male healer) or the suruhåna (female healer). In Guam, the
                    first healers were known as makåhna and kakåhna (shamans who were believed to
                    have magical powers). With the impact of Spanish colonization and the introduction
                    of Christianity, the makåhna and kakåhna no longer practiced. However, others believe
                    that the makåhna and kakåhna continued practicing but identified themselves as
                    suruhånu and suruhåna (derived from <em>cirujano</em>, the Spanish loanword for “sur-
                    geon”). Today in the CNMI, the healer is still commonly called a suruhånu or suruhåna,
                    and sometimes called a yo'åmte, while in Guam the healer is identified as a yo'åmte
                    (meaning “a deeper type of healer”). The terms suruhånu and suruhåna are still
                    used in Guam, but people are starting to use the term yo'åmte more frequently.</p>

                <p><strong>Types of Healing</strong><br/>
                    Suruhånu, suruhåna, and yo'åmte use different kinds of herbs and plants to make
                    remedies for sickness. Sickness can be defined as physical, spiritual, and emotional
                    illness. In both the CNMI and Guam, each healer is capable of performing a variety
                    of healing in addition to practicing a particular specialty. For example, a healer can
                    make <em>åmot</em> (medicine), and provide <em>lasa</em> (massage) and <em>såffe</em> (working with the spir-
                    its or taotaomo'na). Some healers can do all three types of healing (<em>åmot</em>, <em>lasa</em>, and
                    <em>såffe</em>), and some can do a combination of two types of healing. It is more common to
                    find healers doing the <em>åmot</em> and the <em>lasa</em>. Due to the nature of the healing with the
                    spirits, only some healers choose to do this type. Many healers have commented that
                    spiritual healing requires greater energy, because the healer must be stronger than
                    the spirit. If the spirit is stronger, the healer can get sick or be affected negatively by
                    the spirit. As a result, healers are more cautious about working with spirits. Based on
                    what the patient tells them, they can assess the strength of the spirit. At that point,
                    they must decide whether to treat the patient or refer the patient to another healer
                    who specializes in spiritual healing. Another important concept that was noted in
                    interviews conducted by Borja and Roppul (2009) concerning treatment of patients,
                    is the concept of <em>hiningok</em> (“to be heard”). This concept implies that the medicine
                    must be meant for that person being treated if it is to work. If it is not meant to be,
                    <em>ti hiningok</em>, then the medicine or treatment will not work on the patient. A physical
                    sign of <em>ti hiningok</em> is if the <em>åmot</em> wilts in the hands of the healer. If this happens, the
                    understanding is that the <em>åmot</em> will not work or the patient will not come for treat-
                    ment (Borja andamp; Roppul, 2009). This implies that <em>åmot</em> also has a spirit nature. This is
                    also probably why many of the healers explained that it is always important to pray
                    to the spirits before and during the administration of the <em>åmot</em> (J. E. H. Arriola, 2009;
                    M. Arriola, 2015; Borja andamp; Roppul, 2009; Demapan, 2011; Lizama, 2011, 2014).</p>

                <p>Healers treat a variety of ailments, such as fevers, mouth sores, rashes, toothaches,
                    cuts and burns, sprained ankles, female issues, and congestion. Just as healers have
                    a specialty, they also have sub-specialties with the type of patients and ailments they
                    treat. For example, there are healers who specialize in treating illness of babies and
                    congestion. Others help with female problems such as heavy bleeding, menopause,
                    or fertility issues. These healers can address other issues, but most have a specialty.
                    If a patient comes to the healer for a problem that the healer is not able to help with,
                    the healer refers the patient to another healer in the community who can help. This
                    concept is very similar to Western medicine in that a doctor trains for a specific field.
                    All doctors basically have the same initial training. After several years of training,
                    the doctor identifies a specialty such as internal medicine, obstetrics, psychiatry, or
                    pediatrics. Among healers, a specialty is chosen for them based on what was passed
                    on to them from previous generations. An example is a female healer in Rota who
                    knows many of the herbal plants, but patients seek her out primarily for one illness,
                    shingles, <em>Tininun San Antonio</em> in CHamoru. Her mother was the expert in treat-
                    ing <em>Tininun San Antonio</em>, and her mother passed her knowledge on to this healer.
                    Although this healer has knowledge of many herbal plants, her primary specialty
                    is treating shingles. According to Borja and Roppul (2009) and Demapan (2011),
                    healers have specialties and can be classified into the following categories: physical,
                    psychological, and spiritual.</p>

                <p><strong>The Process of Becoming a Healer</strong><br/>
                    Knowledge of traditional healing is generally kept within families and passed on
                    from one generation to another. Healers usually learn their craft from their mother,
                    grandmother, father, grandfather, or another close relative. As young children, some
                    at only 2 or 3 years of age, they begin to accompany their relative to identify, pick, and
                    gather medicine. Actual training to be a healer starts at a very young age. After the
                    child is proficient in identifying the plant, herbs, and roots, they are sent off to iden-
                    tify and pick herbs on their own. This training continues when the child observes
                    how the herbs are cleaned and prepared. Youth can spend years of observing until
                    they are deemed ready to practice. At that point, they are given more responsibility
                    for preparing the <em>åmot</em> with the assistance of the healer until the healer is confident
                    that the “apprentice” is ready to prepare the <em>åmot</em> independently.</p>

                <p>Although being able to identify and prepare the <em>åmot</em> are very important in the
                    training process, there are many more important “rules” that the “apprentice” has to
                    learn. There are rules about respect and entering the jungle as well as rules about the
                    relationship that one has with the environment, the spirit world, and God. For ex-
                    ample, before anyone enters the jungle, the person must ask the spirits of the jungle
                    for permission to enter. CHamorus believe that spirits exist everywhere. If someone
                    were to enter the jungle without asking permission, negative consequences might
                    ensue. Some people claim that a part of their body became swollen, or a purple
                    bruise appeared on their arm or leg as if someone “pinched” them. In Rota, a healer
                    was observed who not only asked permission to enter the jungle but also asked
                    permission from the plants that she was taking as part of her <em>åmot</em>. She chanted to
                    the plants to ask permission to take only a few of the leaves because that was what
                    she needed at the time. She also assured the plants that she was very appreciative
                    of them because they helped her to heal someone who needed help. In addition to
                    asking permission, healers observe rules that regulate when the <em>åmot</em> can be picked
                    and under what conditions. Many healers suggest that the <em>åmot</em> be picked early in
                    the morning. Also, the consensus is that as long as it is not raining, the <em>åmot</em> can be
                    picked before 3 p.m. They discourage picking after 3 p.m. because that is when the
                    “not so nice” spirits roam and can “intercept” the <em>åmot</em>. The mean spirits can cause
                    the <em>åmot</em> to become bad, making it useless or ineffective.</p>

                <p>The last set of rules for healers involves learning what time of day they can treat
                    people and what is acceptable and unacceptable for “payment.” The rules of when
                    not to treat people are very similar to the rules of when to pick <em>åmot</em>. Healers can
                    treat people during most of the day but will stop at around 3 p.m. This is in line with
                    the belief that the mean spirits are more prone to roam after 3 p.m. Healers believe
                    that people should never be treated and <em>åmot</em> should never be picked or transported
                    between 5 to 6 p.m. This is the time that many of the mean spirits roam. Due to the
                    long training time and the intricacies of being a healer, the process of learning how
                    to be a traditional healer takes years and is safeguarded within the family.</p>

                <p>Training goes beyond learning about the medicine; the child is also taught about mas-
                    sage or <em>lasa</em>. CHamorus believe that a child with “good hands” is born breech (bottom
                    or feet first) and has the gift of massaging. Healers believe that, if a child has the gift,
                    then it should be nurtured. However, children do not perform massage at an early age
                    because they do not have the strength. They probably just massage babies and people
                    within their own family. There are certain rules that govern the act of massaging. A
                    woman should never massage when she is experiencing menstruation. A male healer
                    who massages should not massage a woman for fertility issues because that involves
                    having to touch the woman's vagina, which may not be acceptable to her husband.
                    The healer may also experience fear of being accused of sexual assault.</p>

                <p>Many of the rules regarding traditional healing are still very much intact in modern
                    times. The jungle is still respected, permission is sought, and rules for picking plants
                    and propagating them are followed. All of these rules are based on CHamoru values
                    and culture. J. E. H. Arriola (2009) constructed the epistemology of CHamoru values
                    as follows: (1) Yu'os Tåta (God the Father), who is believed to be the ultimate authori-
                    ty in the lives of the CHamoru people; (2) <em>familia</em> (family) life, which revolves around
                    the family unit; (3) <em>tano'</em> (land), which is understood to be the roots of cultural
                    identity; (4) <em>inafa'maolek</em> (interdependence), understood as a cultural practice that
                    promotes the value of <em>respetu</em> (respect) and fosters harmonious interaction among
                    the people, as well as between the people and the land; (5) <em>chenchule'</em> (gifted reci-
                    procity), understood as an unspoken obligation done out of respect and gratitude to
                    assist a family in need; (6) <em>mamåhlao</em> (shame), to be respectful and humble in the
                    presence of other people; (7) <em>manayuda</em> (assistance), the act of helping family and

                <p>Currently, there are an estimated 80 to 90 healers in the CNMI and Guam. The
                    <em>Directory of Traditional Healers and Medicinal Plants in the Commonwealth of the Northern
                    Marianas</em> (Borja andamp; Roppul, 2009) identifies 45 healers who were interviewed in the CNMI;
                    however, not all the healers were interviewed, out of respect for traditional practices.
                    Generally, healers do not advertise. Accessing a healer is via word of mouth. One
                    would never see an advertisement of a healer promoting their services. Being inter-
                    viewed and listed in the directory can be seen as a very public act and may be perceived
                    by some healers as advertisement. However, Borja and Roppul (2009) argued that
                    documenting the identity and knowledge of the traditional healers will support the
                    preservation of the Indigenous knowledge and provides a resource to the community,
                    by means of a directory which will help others gain access to traditional healers instead
                    of just by word of mouth. Typically, healers work out of their home. Currently, there
                    are no partnerships between the hospitals in the CNMI or Guam and the healers.
                    Many doctors in the CNMI and some doctors in Guam, mostly CHamoru, are aware
                    of the existence of the healers. In an informal conversation with a pediatrician in
                    Guam, he said that if a baby were heavily congested or had a bad cold, he would refer
                    the child to a healer. He added that he grew up knowing about the traditional healers
                    and was treated by one as a child.</p>

                <p>Among the 80 to 90 healers in the CNMI and Guam, approximately 15 to 20 of them
                    have died during the past 5 years. There will be a shortage of healers if the knowl-
                    edge is not preserved or perpetuated as healers are dying.</p>

                <p><strong>Perpetuation of Healing Tradition</strong><br/>
                    Many healers spoke of their difficulties in identifying a family member to whom
                    they would like to pass their knowledge and tradition. According to Demapan (2011),
                    the traditional healer aspirant must show interest and be recognized as wanting to
                    be a healer. However, finding these potential healers and future apprentices has
                    been challenging. Lizama (2014) conducted an interview with a Saipan healer,
                    who explained that he did not have children, and although his siblings had chil-
                    dren, they were still very young and did not show an interest. He observed that the
                    children were too consumed with TV, their iPad, and technology overall. He was
                    disheartened that they did not express an interest to learn. His mother told him
                    that he could only pass on the knowledge to another family member. He expressed
                    deep hurt because without another family member to pass on his knowledge to,
                    his valuable knowledge would die with him. The sentiment of this healer has been
                    a common theme of healers in Guam and in the CNMI. Many healers lament that
                    their children are consumed with other things or too busy to learn. A consequence
                    of this situation is that the healers no longer try to teach their children or grandchil-
                    dren if their attempts have been rejected. Although many of the “rules” are honored
                    and are continued by the healers, identifying someone at a young age to start
                    learning has been very difficult. If healers are not able to pass on the tradition to a
                    family member, then to whom will they pass on their knowledge? Technology and
                    modernization are obstacles in the way of recruiting and training young children
                    and family members. The impact of technology and modernization on the younger
                    generation as it affects traditional healing is significant. As a response to this impact
                    in Guam, an apprenticeship program has been developed. In Saipan and in Rota,
                    traditional healing is taught in the school system, and community gardens have
                    been established. These gardens contain medicinal plants that are used to teach
                    children at a young age and have been introduced into the school curriculum. This
                    instructional method differs from the traditional ways, as the learning of traditional
                    healing was previously done in the home. Now, the exposure to plants and healing
                    is done through the school curriculum.</p>

                <p>Although a formal apprenticeship program exists in Guam, recruitment to be an
                    apprentice has been very difficult. In the past 5 years, there have been three appren-
                    tices and in 2021 the Guma Yo'åmte (House of Healers) has one apprentice. Much
                    time and commitment are required of an apprentice. The apprentice accompanies
                    the healer picking <em>åmot</em> and trains at the healing center, observing and being ob-
                    served. This requires the apprentice to be there at all times. The traditional healer
                    apprenticeship is very different from an internship or a practicum placement. An
                    internship has a set requirement of hours for completion. The current model of ap-
                    prenticeship in the healing center does not have a set number of hours; instead, the
                    healers will assess when the apprentice is ready. This can be a difficult time commit-
                    ment for many, as well as an economic hardship, as apprentices are not paid.</p>

                <p>A cultural and social shift has begun, as some healers are now passing on their
                    knowledge to an “apprentice” outside of their family. However, not all healers agree
                    with this shift. Organized groups such as the Åmot Natibu in Saipan and the Håya
                    Foundation and Åmot Farm in Guam have joined together to support the healers,
                    hear their concerns, and help with the preservation and perpetuation of the tra-
                    ditional healing practices. The Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch
                    (IÅN/ASF) is a nonprofit organization formed in 2007 that advocates for, recognizes,
                    and supports traditional healers in the Marianas. Another goal of the IÅN/ASF is
                    to aid in the protection of medicinal plants and to document the healing tradition,
                    as much knowledge is passed on orally. One of the IÅN/ASF's first major projects
                    was to provide the community with a comprehensive trilingual directory (English,
                    CHamoru, and Carolinian) of Indigenous traditional healers in the CNMI. This
                    project was the first documented directory and listed at least 45 traditional healers
                    who are living and currently practicing (although some may have passed since the
                    publication of the directory) in the CNMI. The healers were able to provide a brief
                    description of themselves, how they learned their craft, what their specialties are,
                    and even some recipes for certain ailments. The 700-page directory documents the
                    stories of 45 traditional healers in Saipan, Rota, and Tinian, who chose to be in-
                    cluded. This publication is significant in many ways because one of the rules for
                    healers is that they not publicize what they do, and this rule likely prevented many
                    healers from contributing to the publication. The Guam Council on the Arts and
                    Humanities Agency (CAHA) has been trying to establish a similar directory of heal-
                    ers, yet for years they have not been successful, possibly due to the traditional rule
                    prohibiting healers from advertising.</p>

                <p>The Håya Foundation (2018) was established in Guam in 2005 to “enhance the
                    well-being of our people,” and in support of that mission they have worked on pre-
                    serving, promoting, and perpetuating our traditional healing practices. The Åmot
                    Farm is a preservation farm of medicinal native and introduced plants grown and
                    tended using organic methods. In addition, the Åmot Farm promotes and perpetu-
                    ates the healing practices by providing edu-tourism and ecotourism via farm tours.
                    Although the Håya Foundation and the Åmot Farm are two separate non-profit
                    entities, they work together with a common mission of preserving and perpetuating
                    traditional healing practices.</p>

                <p>The Håya Foundation and the Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch
                    have worked together to address challenges facing our traditional healers. Three
                    Konfrensian Åmot [Conference for Medicinal Herbs] have been held and were very
                    successful. The primary role of these conferences is to bring together the healers so
                    that they can advocate for what they need help with and to educate others about the
                    state of traditional medicine.</p>

                <p>There are many obstacles to the preservation and perpetuation of the traditional heal-
                    ing practices. As mentioned earlier, the knowledge was passed on from generation
                    to generation and yet today many of the children of the healers do not want to per-
                    petuate the tradition. Other obstacles include difficulty accessing medicinal plants
                    and herbs, economic hardship, fear of being exploited, and conflicting CHamoru
                    values, such as that between <em>mamåhlao</em> (humility) and <em>banidosu/a</em> (self-promotion).</p>

                <p>In Guam and Saipan, new construction projects, such as hotels and other establish-
                    ments have involved the clearing of jungle areas, the natural habitat of many of the
                    medicinal plants. Consequently, finding herbs and plants has become increasing-
                    ly difficult. In Saipan, plants that grew in locations close to a healer are no longer
                    available, resulting in healers having to do more traveling or hiking through rough
                    terrain to gain access to the herbs they need to treat patients. A problem that directly
                    impacts Guam is that many of the herbs grow in lush environments controlled by
                    the military. Some of these lands cannot be accessed by healers, and those who do
                    have access need to provide a reason for entry and must produce the appropriate
                    paperwork. A healer from Saipan who was living in Guam shared his story of how
                    he was told that he could get all the medicinal herbs that he needed at Ritidian (a
                    wildlife refuge). He made his way to Ritidian and saw the herbs he needed to treat
                    a patient. He started to collect them but was confronted by a preservation officer
                    who told him that he could not just pick whatever he wanted and that he must get
                    a pass. The healer argued with the preservation officer, declaring that this land be-
                    longs to the people and that he needs the medicine to treat a person. He was almost
                    arrested, and by the time the issue was resolved, it was too late to pick the herbs he
                    needed (according to the rules of when to pick medicine). Feeling sad, the healer
                    left knowing that he could not help the patient until the next day. He also felt angry
                    that he could not access the jungle. He did not experience such obstacles accessing
                    restricted lands in Saipan.</p>

                <p>Healers in Rota and Tinian, when asked if they had problems collecting the <em>åmot</em>
                    or having access, stated that they generally did not have any difficulties gathering
                    the medicine. They complained, however, that many young people do not recognize
                    the difference between medicinal plants/herbs and weeds, so when doing yard work
                    or bush cutting, they inadvertently kill the plants. The older healers explained that
                    some plants flourish in their natural habitats in the valley, near water, or near rocky
                    environments and can be difficult to access, as the healers are not as fit as they used
                    to be. Thus, while access to traditional plants in Saipan is not quite as obstructed
                    as in Guam, in general, access has become constrained by various means and to
                    various degrees in all the islands in the Marianas.</p>

                <p><strong>Additional Dynamics at Work Today</strong><br/>
                    When asked where they obtained their healing power, many of the healers re-
                    sponded that it was a gift from God. Some said that the spirits also guided them.
                    As mentioned earlier, a healer must adhere to traditional rules; one in particular
                    stipulates that a healer should never take money as a form of payment. Demapan's
                    (2011) interviews with healers revealed that most do not charge for treatment.
                    Traditionally, in gratitude for the healer's help, an individual or family will leave
                    gifts of appreciation. These gifts can take the form of a case of frozen chicken, a
                    sack of rice, or fresh fruits, vegetables, or fish. Whatever the patient gives out of the
                    kindness of the heart should be accepted.</p>

                <p>When I asked healers about accepting money as payment, there were several differ-
                    ing opinions. Many healers said they accepted anything but money. Some explained
                    that instead of money, they tell the patient to take the money and offer Mass in-
                    tentions at church. One healer questioned the difference between taking a case of
                    spareribs versus accepting money. Why could he not take the money and buy what
                    is needed? He noted that in the past, there may not have been a need for money, but
                    in modern times, the need exists.</p>

                <p>A commonality among the healers in the CNMI and Guam is that healers will
                    accept whatever a patient gives. If the patient cannot give anything, that is also fine.
                    The healers feel that they received the healing gift from God and that they should
                    not charge. Many believe that if they charge, the healing would not work, and the
                    patient would not be helped. For healers who were open to accepting money, they
                    had one rule: the money could not be given directly to them and either had to be
                    left on the table or on another object. These healers also believe that a healer could
                    not name a price or have a set price list, unlike massage establishments, which post
                    price lists for a 30-minute massage, a 60-minute massage, etc. These healers feel that
                    if a person wants to pay in cash, it is up to the individual to determine how much
                    they want to give, so long as it is from the kindness of their heart.</p>

                <p>Another change that has been observed is that for centuries, healers have practiced
                    out of their homes, their natural habitat. This is still very true for the CNMI, but there
                    have been some changes in Guam. For example, in May 2016, the Guma Yo'åmte was
                    established because many in the community wanted access to a healer, but did not
                    know where to find one. Traditionally, healers do not advertise and are located by
                    word of mouth. Today, there are three healers who practice full-time at the Guma
                    Yo'åmte and two who practice part-time in addition to conducting home visits.</p>

                <p>This shift marks a change, since healers did not usually go to patients' homes
                    unless it was a spiritual issue that required them to <em>såffe</em> the person's home and
                    other belongings. The two healers who conduct home visits receive many requests
                    from those who have had strokes or more serious health conditions that prevent
                    them from being transported by car to Guma Yo'åmte. Having a house of healers
                    and healers who do home visits is different from what has been practiced in the
                    past. However, these practices are necessary to improve access to care provided by
                    traditional healers. Now that some healers are conducting home visits, concerns
                    over the need and cost of gas have emerged, leading to questions of whether these
                    healers should charge a fee for costs incurred when conducting home visits. When
                    asked about charging for gas, the healers responded by saying, “Whatever people
                    want to give.” With further inquiry, one of the healers commented, “It always works
                    out. For example, someone will give $20, someone will give $0, and then someone
                    gives $100. I don't worry about it because it always works out.”</p>

                <p>The popularity of a centralized healing center, the Guma Yo'åmte, is represented
                    in several charts below, which show the utilization of the services that the Guma
                    Yo'åmte provided from May 2016 until June 2017. Originally the Guma Yo'åmte was
                    only open Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and half day on Saturdays. However,
                    the response from the community has been phenomenal. Due the demand, as of
                    September 2017, they are open every day except Sunday. The chart below (Figure 1)
                    shows that the Guma Yo'åmte has had about 1,999 visitors between May 2016 when it
                    opened, and June 2017, averaging about 143 visitors a month. Some are repeat visitors
                    because most treatments require that patients be tended to for 3 days in a row.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Data comes from the visitor's log. Total number of visitors is 1,999. Average monthly number of visitors is 143.</p>

                <p>The chart below (Figure 2) displays the age of female visitors and the problems
                    for which they sought treatment at the Guma Yo'åmte within a particular month.
                    The healers were sought out for the following: <em>såffe</em>, massage, <em>chotge</em>, and there
                    were two other categories for unspecified and other problems. It should be noted
                    that the demographic information is limited. Although the Guma Yo'åmte had
                    the forms available, no one was ensuring that patients were filling out the forms
                    completely. If a patient completed a form, it was appreciated, but it was not of
                    great concern if they did not. Greater efforts are now being taken to encourage the
                    completion of forms by patients.</p>

                <p>From the information collected, 108 females filled out the intake form. These fe-
                    males ranged in age from under 12 to over 75. The majority of patients were seen
                    for massage, with the exception of those under the age of 12, who were seen for
                    <em>chotge</em>. <em>Chotge</em> is a method used for newborns, infants, and young children where
                    the <em>åmot</em> is put into a cloth and squeezed into the child's mouth. This type of <em>åmot</em>
                    and method is used for children who have a lot of congestion, a bad cold, or are
                    coughing. The method is commonly used for newborns who may have ingested
                    amniotic fluid, or who may need to clear their system of any food or toxins from the
                    mother. For example, if a child has skin problems, the healer may tell the mother
                    that she might have consumed too many spicy foods while pregnant, which may
                    have caused the child's skin problems. The unspecified or other categories could
                    mean that patients came for reasons such as the flu, pneumonia, fertility concerns,
                    menstruation, or menopause.</p>

                <p>The results were very similar for the male patients (Figure 3). There were 70 male
                    patients who filled out the demographic form. These patients also ranged in age
                    from under 12 to over 75. Many of the patients came for a massage, with the exception
                    of patients under the age of 12, who came for <em>chotge</em> and massage. There were also
                    many patients who came for other ailments such as the <em>såffe</em>. The unspecified or
                    other categories could mean that they came for conditions such as the flu, pneumo-
                    nia, sprains, or back problems.</p>

                    <strong>Note:</strong> Data comes from intake forms. Total number of male visitors in this particular month was 70.</p>

                <p>Five patients did not fill out the gender portion of the form. One person between
                    the ages of 35 to 44 sought help for <em>såffe</em>, and another between the ages of 45 to 54
                    sought massage. Two visitors under the age of 12 and another patient between 12-and
                    17-years-old indicated “other.” Although there have not been many demographic
                    forms completed by this particular group, it is clear that overall, many people are
                    seeking the services of a traditional healer. The demand for traditional healing ser-
                    vices is quite high. Based on observations by healers and conversations with them,
                    all age groups are utilizing the services of the healers.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br/>
                    The practice of traditional healing has continued in the Marianas despite strug-
                    gles with preservation and perpetuation. However, in order for traditional healing
                    practices to survive, a new model of practice has been developed. This new model
                    involves a centralized location where healers can practice, as well as the develop-
                    ment of an apprenticeship system for those interested in learning but who may
                    not be from a family of traditional healers. Some healers still practice out of their
                    homes, and most healers—both in the home and at the Guma Yo'åmte—still honor
                    the traditional rules of picking <em>åmot</em> and respect. Another change has been the
                    communication between healers within formal settings, such as within meetings
                    and at conferences. Healers have redefined what “advertising” or “publicizing”
                    their services mean; they now speak publicly at school sites, are present at fairs,
                    and conduct demonstrations at public events. They also attend conferences that
                    deal with healing and have increased their public presence. The examples above
                    are changes that are being made among Guam healers. In January 2018, at the Third
                    Konfrensian Åmot, healers from the CNMI echoed the sentiments of healers from
                    Guam and expressed their desire for the establishment of a healing center. Healers
                    from Saipan and Rota have sought assistance from the Håya Foundation to open
                    healing centers in Saipan and Rota. The Håya Foundation will work closely with the
                    Inetnon Åmot Natibu/Ammwelil Safeyal Faluwasch to help develop healing centers
                    in Saipan, Rota, and eventually, Tinian. The island groups have agreed to tackle the
                    threat of extinction of traditional healing practices if there is not a mechanism in
                    place for preservation. The Saipan healers would like to be next in opening a heal-
                    ing center in collaboration with healers from Rota. As an additional collaborative
                    effort, the healers facilitated a CHamoru immersion camp in the summer of 2017 to
                    teach 40 youths ages 14 and up about traditional CHamoru practices, including, but
                    not limited to, fishing, weaving, and storytelling. While there are still distinct differ-
                    ences among the Mariana Islands and some debate over how the practice should
                    be passed on, it is universally agreed that the practice is deeply embedded in the
                    CHamoru culture and must be passed on. If the methods described above do not
                    continue and apprentices are not trained, a crisis will occur as at least 25% of the
                    healers interviewed have already passed away from 2014 to 2020.</p>

                <p>Digital, legal, political, and spiritual resistance to escalating militarization in the
                Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (hereafter CNMI) is currently
                unfolding across the archipelago. Chamorro and Refaluwasch (Carolinian)
                women and women-led organizations are resisting through online petitions, soli-
                darity videos, and federal lawsuits. The context of the resistance relates directly to
                the United States Department of Defenseʼs (hereafter DOD) latest Draft/Overseas
                Environmental Impact Statement released in April 2015, <em>The Commonwealth of the
                Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training</em>.</p>

                <p><strong>The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training</strong><br/>
                In April 2015, <em>The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training
                (CJMT) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) / Overseas Environmental Impact
                Statement (OEIS)</em> document was released. This 1,400-page document proposes the
                creation of Live-Fire Training Range Complexes (LFTRCs) on Pågan and Tinian islands,
                the use of the beaches for amphibious landings, and the sea around the islands for war
                exercises and sonar testing. The US Navy wants Tinian for 20 weeks of live-fire training
                and 22 weeks a year of non-live activity, including munitions storage, danger zones, and
                airspace and seaspace restrictions (Figure 1). The military wants to employ the island
                of Pågan as a high-level bombing range for exercises from the land, air, and sea, includ-
                ing “guns-blazing war games” for at least 16 weeks a year (Cloud, 2015). However, the
                CJMT document includes the possibility of such activity for 40 weeks per year in Pågan
                and 45 weeks in Tinian (Hofschneider, 2016b). The current surge in women's resistance
                to these plans is evident through online petitions, solidarity videos, and court cases
                (Frain, 2017).</p>

                <p>During the negotiations that began in 1972 for the “Covenant to Establish a
                Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United
                States,” the US Navy announced it needed to establish a $300 million joint
                Air Force-Navy airfield, a multi-service airbase, a logistics supply depot, a marine
                amphibious training center, and an over-the-horizon radar facility in Tinian. The
                DOD wanted to “lease” the entire island of Tinian. The residents were promised
                US military base jobs, education for their children in base schools, use of the hospi-
                tal, and other benefits. But the promises relating to the benefits for the community
                never came to fruition. The joint-base plan was never implemented, nor was the
                school or hospital (Hofschneider, 2016b). Many saw this not as true self-determina-
                tion; rather, the “United States, needing to ensure their military objectives, rigged
                the Commonwealth Covenant plebiscite” (Dé Ishtar, 1994, p. 93).</p>

                <p>The Covenant Agreement offers two sections for interaction between local CNMI
                political leaders on the one hand, and the DOD and the US federal government
                on the other. Both the Military Technical Agreement (MTA) relating to the military
                lease for Tinian and “Section 902” permit consultations and discussions between
                the CNMI leadership and the US DOI to (re)assess “all matters affecting the rela-
                tionship between them” (Villahermosa, 2016a). In June 2016, Governor Ralph Deleon
                Guerrero Torres traveled to Washington, DC for the Covenant 902 talks with the
                Department of the Interior (DOI) and the DOD (Hofschneider, 2016b). Speaking to
                the DOD personally regarding the proposed CJMT document, he stated, “We have
                an existing contract. That needs to be fulfilled before you start proposing anything
                else. That's what we want. Nothing more, nothing else” (Chan, 2016). Torres referred
                to the MTA as the “existing contract.” In addition, Torres wrote in a letter to Lt. Gen.
                Anthony Crutchfield, the DOD's current point of contact, in which he asserted that
                prior programmatic agreements “with the military should move forward first before
                another agreement is signed” (Villahermosa, 2016b).</p>

                <p>Today's resistance to the militarization of the islands is met with the DOD response
                that the residents “knew about their military obligations when they voted for the
                Marianas Commonwealth Covenant.” When challenged about past “unfulfilled
                promises” made by the DOD and previous agreements, the (now former) Marine
                Forces Pacific Executive Director, Craig B. Whelden, claims that he “does not know
                what happened 30 or 40 years ago” (Zotomayor, 2015c, p. 4). The contemporary
                situation is further complicated because the LFTRC plans for Tinian and Pågan
                islands are contingent on the relocation of the 5,000 Marines and their dependents
                to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Tinian and Pågan islands become LFTRCs,
                while Guam provides the housing and an additional LFTRC.</p>

                <p>The resistance is complex, especially as the population of the CNMI serves in the
                US military at extremely high rates. The forms of resistance demonstrate an under-
                standing that the “US military” is not one monolithic organization, but it is diverse.
                Indigenous residents proudly serve in the US Armed Forces, while at the same time
                they want to “protect and defend” their sacred lands and seas from becoming Live
                Fire Training Range Complexes: “We definitely support our military's needs to train
                and be ready, but please do not destroy our homes in [the] process” (Hofschneider,
                2016a). The women leading the resistance also reiterate how they are not “anti-mil-
                itary,” but demand that the DOD explain unfulfilled commitments and uphold
                previous agreements, before drafting new agreements and making additional prom-
                ises to the community (T. Sablan, personal communication, July 9, 2016).</p>

                <p>Although the projects are interconnected and interdependent, the DOD has re-
                leased six Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) documents at various stages as if
                they are separate projects. This tactic of “unbundling” and detaching is the focus of a
                lawsuit recently filed in the federal court in Saipan and discussed in the final section
                of this chapter (Ngata, 2016). While the CNMI is considered “America's best-kept
                secret” by the tourism industry, it is also considered US “soil” by the DOD, which
                can potentially exercise eminent domain in the name of “national security” to use
                the land, sea, and air for military purposes (Ortigas, 2016; Villahermosa, 2016c).</p>

                <p><strong>The Community Responds During the Public Comment Period 2015</strong><br/>
                After the release of this large and highly technical CJMT document, and as required
                by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the US military provided only 30
                to 90 days for the public to submit written or verbal comments from elected officials,
                governmental agencies, private-sector institutions, businesses, community organi-
                zations and the general public (Zotomayor, 2015a). During this period, the DOD
                held (and controlled) “culturally inappropriate open-house style public meetings” at
                schools in Saipan and Tinian, some of which were poorly attended. Four Chamorro
                and Refaluwasch scholars and residents outlined how the EIS “public meeting”
                forum is culturally incompatible with Chamorro and Refaluwasch methods of gath-
                ering community input and feedback. They discuss how reciprocal culture creates
                generous hosts, but there are “obligations and proper etiquette for the guests,” for
                example, a US government agency like the military (Cabrera et al., 2015). Within the
                framework of being a “good guest,” the authors discuss how to properly and respect-
                fully gather input from the community and the importance of oral culture. “Good
                Guests” do not ask for “more than they should receive given the relationship history
                and the reciprocal obligations tied to that request” (Cabrera et al., 2015).</p>

                <p>Numerous residents are also US Armed Forces veterans, and they spoke at these
                meetings of their experience of “protecting and defending” US interests abroad, and
                how they are now resisting the destruction of their homeland. Veteran Francella
                Kaipat Reyes delivered her testimony with her daughter Natasha by her side. As
                described by her auntie:</p>

                <p>When she raised her right hand and swore to protect and defend her coun-
                try and her people, she did so with no questions asked. And she endured the
                painful sacrifice of leaving her daughter motherless for 13 months while she
                was deployed overseas. She told us her feet touched the sands (and grounds) of
                Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote places that's [sic] hard for us to pronounce,
                let alone spell. Through it all, she gave her all and served as a loyal, patriotic
                daughter of the CNMI, serving her people and country. Today, she adds her plea
                to the chorus of voices asking for Uncle Sam not to destroy Pågan. (Kaipat, 2015)</p>

                <p>Peace activist, Director of Community Building with the Micronesian Climate
                Change Alliance, teacher, and mother, Moñeka De Oro provided testimony at the
                CJMT Public Meeting held at Tinian Junior Senior High School on April 30, 2015 (on
                the same date as the popular Tinian Fiesta, a community event that nearly all 3,500
                residents attend). In a video of her testimony posted on Alternative Zero Coalition's
                (2015) Facebook page, De Oro proclaimed:</p>

                <p>As a Chamoru, I would be remiss if I didn't teach my students about the
                4,000-year-old history and how our ancestors have fought hard over the last
                500 years against foreign domination to keep our islands, our language, and
                our culture alive. We need to still honor them here today. As a Peace Activist, I
                would be remiss if I didn't teach my students that in the 239 years of American
                history, 222 of those years have been fighting wars and in conflicts all over the
                world. And Chamorros, Carolinians [Refaluwasch], and Micronesians have
                been fighting, suffering and dying in these wars. And we STILL can't vote for
                a president! Enough is enough! Not one bomb, not one bullet in our islands!
                I would be remiss if I didn't tell my students that there is a better way. Our an-
                cestors knew a better way. They knew something that the American forefathers
                never knew. Something that the American consume-and-waste economy does
                not know. That we are all one!</p>

                <p>At the EIS meetings, these women (one a soldier, the other a teacher, and both
                mothers) highlighted “protecting” and “defending,” while honoring the ancestors
                and the genealogy of resistance to keep the islands, language, and culture alive.
                The soldier vowed to protect and defend her people and country and served in the
                US military overseas. However, when she returned, “Uncle Sam” wanted to destroy
                her homeland. The teacher alluded to honoring the ancestors, whose knowledge is
                4,000 years old—much older than the US “ideals” of democracy and freedom that
                come at the expense of the people of the Marianas and that are required parts of the
                curriculum in the local schools.</p>

                <p>Despite the recurring release of numerous “lengthy, technical, complex American
                English-language documents that refer to one another, which have been 11,000,
                4,000, and 1,500 pages long,” CNMI residents, including politicians, and even US
                federal agencies, have expressed strong opposition to the expanding militarization
                (Cabrera et al., 2015). A record number of nearly 30,000 written comments opposing
                the project were submitted during the public response period, closing on October
                2, 2015 (Hofschneider, 2016d). Residents and their supporters continue to voice their
                concerns through letters to the editors of the local newspapers, the <em>Marianas Variety</em>
                and the <em>Saipan Tribune</em> (Dayao, 2015a; Dayao, 2015b; Frain, 2015; Zotomayor, 2015b).
                Local residents question the necessity of using their limited landmass and waters
                for high impact, live-fire training purposes. Cinta M. Kaipat (2015), a Chamorro and
                Refaluwasch attorney who was born on Agrigan, an island north of her childhood
                home of Pågan, and who currently resides in Saipan, asked, “how would they [the
                military] like it if this was done in their backyard? If they need to do this training so
                badly, why not in California, Washington [State], or Texas?”</p>

                In addition to the public hearings and a record number of written comments submit-
                ted, many CNMI politicians have also voiced opposition to the further militarization
                of the archipelago. In April 2015, shortly after the release of the CJMT proposal, the
                Federal and Foreign Affairs Committee in the Marianas House voted 19-0 in favor of
                a resolution introduced by the late Governor Inos to “oppose any and all proposed
                military use of Pågan” (Cloud, 2015). The House Committee on Federal and Foreign
                Affairs Chair, Representative Angel Demapan, referred to Guam's experience with
                the DOD and to a successful lawsuit, which saved the sacred Pågat village from be-
                coming an LFTRC. Representative Demapan stated,</p>

                <p>The [US] military used the same tactics with the people of Guam when they
                tried to build a base in a Chamorro village which the people of Guam opposed.
                You would think after the military's experience with Guam that they would
                learn, but it appears that they didn't learn and they are treating us the same way
                and with the same tactics that they imposed on the people of Guam. But we will
                remain vigilant and we will fight for our position. (Villahermosa, 2015)</p>

                <p>In support of this stance, the CNMI administration hired a team of legal experts,
                Dentons Environmental Science Associates (hereafter Dentons), to review the “legal
                adequacy” of the CJMT proposal on behalf of the CNMI government. They found it
                “fails to meet even the most basic requirements … and the limited evidence present-
                ed in the document suggests that the CJMT would violate both federal and CNMI
                law” (Dentons US LLP Environmental Science Associates, 2015). Attorney Nicholas
                Yost of Dentons reassured the CNMI that “no one is above the law and that includes
                the military.” Attorney Matthew Adams, also with Dentons, added that the DEIS
                lacks “alternatives, impact analysis, mitigation, and public input” and concluded,
                based on these initial findings, that the CJMT is “non-compliant with the basic prin-
                ciples of the NEPA” (Kedi andamp; Scaliem, 2015, p. 3).</p>

                <p><strong>An Environmental Commitment Example: Chiget Mortar Range</strong><br/>
                For the past 5 years, Tinian mayors, CNMI governors, and local historians have issued
                numerous requests for the DOD to clean up the Chiget Mortar Range. Tinian Mayor,
                Joey P. San Nicolas, continuously demands this must happen before Tinian considers
                the construction of additional LFTRCs (Chan, 2015a; Chan 2015b; Zotomayor, 2015c).
                The 97.5-acre Chiget Mortar artillery range was used or live-fire training from 1945-
                1994 and remains a military “scar” and a “dudded impact area.” It is contaminated with
                chromium and iron, exceeding the 2008 Guam Environmental Protection Agency
                Pacific Basin Environment Screening Levels for groundwater that is a current or po-
                tential source of drinking water (Chan, 2015b). Located next to the popular tourist
                site, the Tinian Blow Hole, the range has remained closed. This serves as an example
                of what happens to a “high-impact area,” such as those outlined in the CJMT. For
                those resisting militarization, it demonstrates an additional unfulfilled commitment
                by the DOD. Women's resistance in Tinian maintains that they are not “unpatriotic”
                or “un-American,” and in fact, “We believed in America,” but historical (in)actions
                by both the US federal government and the DOD show otherwise (Hofschneider,
                2016d). The ongoing environmental degradation is an everyday aspect of militariza-
                tion that fuels the women's legal, political, and spiritual resistance.</p>

                <p><strong>Military Technical Agreement, Section 802</strong><br/>
                Commonly referred to as the “MTA,” the Military Technical Agreement Article 8:
                Property, Section 802, Id.§104, states that, “property will be made available to the
                Government of the United States by lease to enable it to carry out its defense respon-
                sibilities” (Willens andamp; Siemer, 2002). In addition, the MTA outlines the perimeters of
                the military lease and use of land in Saipan, Tinian, and No'os (Farrallon de Medinilla,
                FDM) islands. The 1970s lease value of the land and waters immediately adjacent to
                Tinian was determined at $17.5 million US (approximately $74 million today), while
                the entire island and waters surrounding No'os (Farrallon de Medinilla, FDM) were
                valued at $20,600 US (approximately $86,000 today) (Farrell, 1991, p. 595). The MTA
                instructs the US to “recognize” and “respect” that the people “need, depend upon
                and cherish their very limited land,” of 184 square miles (Taitano, 2015). However, the
                extent of this recognition is unclear, and many are concerned that the US military
                may still use the principle of eminent domain and claim “national security” to push
                the militarization plans, while disregarding the Covenant Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>Save Tinian #SaveTinian</strong><br/>
                While the MTA outlines the structure of the lease, including the acreage, price, and
                activities the military may conduct, the exploitation of Tinian for an LFTRC and the
                use of live fire are in direct violation of the Covenant Agreement. The planned con-
                struction of an LFTRC will degrade land, destroy acres of coral, and put residents
                at risk of death and injury from stray ordnance. Furthermore, the Environmental
                Protection Agency (EPA) is concerned that the planned construction will pollute the
                Tinian aquifer, the only groundwater source for its 3,100 residents (Hofschneider,
                2016b). The late Eloy Inos, the 8th Governor of the CNMI, stated it would “violate
                the terms and spirit of the original Tinian land lease agreement” (Chan, 2015a).</p>

                <p>Members of the Tinian Women's Association (hereafter TWA), a non-profit group
                dedicated to preserving the Chamorro culture and advocating for Tinian women
                and children, submitted comments to the Navy's environmental review and passed
                out informational flyers to inform local residents. Deborah Fleming, who was a
                child during the formation of the Covenant and is now a spokeswoman for TWA,
                said that when two-thirds of Tinian was leased by the US military in the 1970s, “use
                of the island as a firing range was never discussed, and elders would not have agreed
                to this. It is as far beyond” what local communities agreed to when they participated
                in the political status plebiscite. Fleming continued, “Now we're presented with a
                totally different picture of using our island as a bombing range which we oppose
                because the plan fails to identify what those effects are, so that our people are aware
                about exactly what is happening” (Radio New Zealand, 2016). TWA member Florine
                Hofschneider said in a media statement, “We refuse to accept the Navy's plan to
                subject our children to nearly constant bombardment” (Jones, 2016). The women's
                legal resistance is based on the MTA, while their political resistance is interwoven
                with the local politicians' efforts and abilities as structured through the Covenant
                902 talks. As Ms. Fleming stated, “We believed in America. Instead what they want
                to do is destroy our island” (Hofschneider, 2016d).</p>

                <p>While maintaining that they are not “anti-military” or “anti-American,” local res-
                idents assert that the military must at least fulfill past promises. They believe that
                neither live-fire bombing in Tinian nor the use of Pågan were included in the
                Covenant Agreement. They question the necessity of using their limited landmass
                and waters for high impact, live-fire training purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>Save Pågan #SavePagan</strong><br/>
                The MTA outlined the lease for two-thirds of Tinian, and all of No'os; however,
                it never mentioned any additional islands, including Pågan island. The US Navy
                considers Pågan the “perfect” diverse training location. Its aim includes “tank ma-
                neuvers, amphibious landings, land mines, grenade launchers, rockets, mortars,
                missiles, shells, and air-dropped bombs up to 1000 pounds” from B-52s, drones,
                helicopters, and fighter jets (Chamorro.com, 2016). The black sand beaches are large
                enough for “amphibious landings and trainings” with fleets of warships (US Marine
                Corps Forces Pacific, 2015). The former executive director of Marine Corps forces in
                the Pacific claims that “We would protect it like it was our own” (Cloud, 2015).</p>

                <p><strong>Homestead Program</strong><br/>
                According to the late Northern Islands Mayor, Jerome Kaipat Aldan, the Chamorro
                people's history on Pågan goes back to the 1300s, and despite forced relocation
                by Spanish, German, Japanese, and US colonizers, the ancestral connections
                remain strong to the volcanic and resource-rich island and waters surrounding it
                (Hofschneider, 2016c). For over 30 years, more than 50 families who consider Pågan
                home have planned and are eager to return to the homesteads (Cave, 2015). It is this
                community of residents, led by women, who are instrumental in the digital, legal,
                political, and spiritual resistance. The former residents who remain in Saipan have
                formed coalitions and consistently advocate for the implementation of a homestead
                program, which will grant homestead lots to former residents (Todiño, 2014).</p>

                <p><strong>Women's Resistance</strong><br/>
                Three women-led organizations based in the CNMI are involved in the resistance,
                each with varying focuses and goals. The community group, Tinian Women's
                Association, cites the DOD's unfulfilled past commitments and previous agree-
                ments as the source of their legal and political resistance. The Guardians of Gani'
                spiritually resist militarization to protect the sensitive and unique environments
                of the Northern Mariana Islands, and honor the genealogical connection to the
                archipelago. Digital resistance by Alternative Zero Coalition employs new media
                technologies to foster fluidarity and seek to control the future development of Pågan,
                as former residents express their desire to return home (Figure 2).</p>

                <p>Through similar avenues used in Guam to counter the initial military “build-up”
                announcement, CNMI women are employing digital, legal, political, and spiritual
                forms of resistance. First, an online petition gathered international support with
                over 120,000 signatures and (inter)national media coverage. Second, the young
                women in Guam filmed and shared a solidary YouTube video, encouraging others
                to #jointhemovement. Third, a lawsuit was filed in July 2016 accusing the DOD of
                failing to create one complete EIS document or explore potential alternative lo-
                cations. Finally, the resistance efforts are grounded in the spiritual connection to
                the seascape, supported by matriarchal principles, and shared on digital platforms
                through hashtags such as #SaveTinian #SavePagan and #JoinTheMovement.</p>

                <p>As the community waits for additional EIS documents to be released by the DOD,
                women-led community organizations, along with a woman attorney from Tinian
                working with Earthjustice, filed a lawsuit against the DOD with the federal court
                in Saipan. The Northern Islands Mayor's Office created a CNMI Northern Islands
                Facebook page to highlight the beauty of the islands, and for other users to share
                their stories and visualize the connection. Arley Long from Tinian created the letter,
                “DO NOT use the inhabited US islands of Tinian and Pågan as a HIGH IMPACT
                bombing range” on the online petitioning platform, Change.org (Figure 3). Long's
                letter petitioned the legal and political “decision makers,” including the DOD, in
                which the islanders have no input; the President of the United States, who they
                cannot vote for; the United States House of Representatives, in which they have a
                nonvoting delegate; and the United States Senate, in which they are without repre-
                sentation. Within a number of weeks, the petition gathered 121,454 signatures from
                across the globe, and stories were featured in <em>The Guardian</em> and in the US military
                publication, <em>Stars and Stripes</em> (McCurry, 2015; Olson, 2015).</p>

                <p>As an online petition platform, Change.org allows for “petition updates” to provide
                up-to-date information regarding a cause, as well as comments from those virtually
                signing a petition. There are debates regarding the “success” of online petitions,
                with some scholars criticizing “clicktivism” for not translating into real political or
                social action or movements beyond the digital realm (Johnson, 2011). Others maintain
                that “hashtag activism” and “digital technologies have imbued everyday citizen-
                ship with more power than ever before” (Karpf, 2015, p. 61). In this case, the online
                petition did lead to real action and inspired the people of the Mariana Islands to
                know that thousands of people beyond the archipelago signed on in solidarity.
                The “one response” from the decision makers came from Representative Mike Honda
                of California, who is Chair Emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American
                Caucus. Representative Honda expressed his support for the digital petition, and he
                commented on how the House of Representatives considered the National Defense
                Authorization Act in June of 2015:</p>

                <p>My good friend Delegate Gregorio Kilili Sablan from CNMI offered an
                amendment that would have required the Department of Defense to reach an
                agreement with the Government of the Northern Marianas on the nature and
                scope of activities before any funds could be expended for expanded military
                activities in the Northern Mariana Islands … I voted in support of the amend-
                ment. Unfortunately, it was defeated by a vote of 173-256. (Honda, 2015)</p>

                <p>Although the online petition has since closed, the site contains comments from sig-
                natories, media updates, and links to share on new media platforms. The women
                protectors and defenders believe that the more people know about the Marianas
                archipelago, the more likely the resistance will result in stopping the Pacific pivot in
                the Marianas. This is an era of Indigenous resistance, such as defenders of Mauna
                Kea, the 4,200-meter-high volcano on the Big Island of Hawai‘i and digitalized as
                #WeAreMaunaKea, which (so far) has halted the construction of an additional
                telescope, and the water protectors at Standing Rock, North Dakota, resisting the
                “black snake” of oil pipelines with #NoDAPL and #WaterIsLife (Ngata, 2016; NYC
                Stands with Standing Rock Collective, 2016). Sharing and honoring sacred rights in
                one place helps to inspire solidarity with others struggling elsewhere. Digitally, the
                protectors in Oceania and the continental US embody the reciprocal connection
                between the sacred environment and themselves.</p>

                <p>In 2015, the History and Culture of Guam class at the Academy of Our Lady of
                Guam, launched a “video campaign in solidarity with the rest of the Marianas [sic]
                Islands” to support their sisters in the north. The students created the three-min-
                ute video, <em>Guahan in Solidarity with Tinian and Pagan</em>, stating, “The United States
                military has made plans to use our islands as live-fire ranges without consenting
                [sic] the Indigenous people that inhabit these precious islands.” The short video
                opens with dramatic music and beautiful imagery of Tinian and Pågan islands, and
                then abruptly cuts to President Obama giving a speech, representing the 2011 “Asia
                Pacific Pivot” announcement he gave in Australia. The first minute includes archi-
                val footage of US flags and soldiers marching, as well as explosive live-fire military
                bombings and amphibious landings, analogous to those proposed for Tinian and
                Pågan. A news correspondent with a non-American accent narrates, stating, “the US
                military has not taken Indigenous and cultural factors into account. The military
                plans to lease the ‘uninhibited island' in its entirety so the Navy, Army, Air Force,
                and Marines can carry out live-fire trainings.” They contrast the colonial-military
                imagery with a young woman on the beach waving the Guam flag.</p>

                <p>The juxtaposition of imagery is understood as the imperial ideologies pushed by
                the US federal government and the DOD. Framed as “national defense,” the im-
                agery includes symbols of empire—flags, military weapons, and troops. As the
                music shifts to relaxing instrumental, a dozen young women line up on the beach,
                representing a more sacred and Indigenous approach to social systems. Joining
                hands, the women express unity and solidarity with their sisters in the islands to
                the north. They display the signs: “❤ Pågan,” “Prutehi yan Difendi,” and “Protect
                and Defend Pågan and Tinian,” “Our Islands Are Sacred,” and “We Stand with
                Pågan and Tinian.” The final scene shows the young women all coming together
                at the main intersection in downtown Tumon Bay, the tourist district. They include
                the hashtag #WeStandWithPåganandTinian. The video ends with the hashtag
                #OurIslandsAreSacred and encourages the viewers to “Join the Movement” to pro-
                tect Pågan and Tinian (see Figure 4). As of October 2021, the video has over 14,448
                views and has gained support globally.</p>

                <p>Similar themes from the resistance in Guam are shared throughout the archi-
                pelago. Such resistance often references the <em>Inifresi</em>, the Chamorro pledge,
                through the phrase “prutehi yan difendi.” The symbols of solidarity included in
                the #OurIslandsAreSacred #WeStandWithPaganandTinian hashtags, link the
                movements across the archipelago, both digitally and culturally. Arley Long,
                the mother who created the online petition in Tinian, included the link to the
                YouTube video under “updates” on the Change.org online petition as well.</p>

                <p>It is through digital and community resistance that Chamorro and Refaluwasch
                women of the Mariana Islands foster transoceanic fluidarity and visualize an alter-
                native decolonized and demilitarized future for themselves and generations to come.
                The resistance in the Mariana archipelago navigates within Indigenous collective
                cultural frameworks and adapts digital technologies and new media platforms.</p>

                <p><strong>Legal Resistance: Suing the US Department of Defense</strong><br/>
                The final section of this chapter analyzes future possibilities, as women-led com-
                munity groups filed a lawsuit against the DOD in the United States District Court
                for the CNMI in Saipan in July 2016 (Figure 5). Kimberlyn King-Hinds is the local
                attorney working with the environmental law organization, Earthjustice. In addi-
                tion to gathering community support, King-Hinds has the support of CNMI elected
                officials, including the Mayor of Tinian, the Governor of the CNMI, and the late
                Mayor Aldan of the CNMI, who was the first to oppose the live-fire training (Perez,
                2016). The women-led legal resistance and the filing of a lawsuit against the US Navy
                and DOD in the federal court in Saipan are specifically related to the ten years of
                EIS documents released since <em>The United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
                Implementation Agreement</em> announcement of 2006, culminating with the CJMT
                document released in 2015.</p>

                    of the Tinian Women's Association, the Guardians of Gani, Pagan Watch and the Center for Biological Diversity

                <p>The lawsuit accuses the US Navy and the DOD of failing to produce one concise
                EIS report, a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The
                second complaint is similar to the 2010 case in Guam in which residents success-
                fully sued. The DOD has not considered any alternative locations for high-impact
                LFTRCs, which could potentially cause less harm (Hofschneider, 2016b).</p>

                <p>The Law Office of Kimberlyn King-Hinds (F0495) of San Jose Village, Tinian, filed
                Civil No. 16-00022 in the United States District Court for the CNMI in Saipan on
                behalf of the following organizations: the Tinian Women's Association, Guardians
                of Gani', PaganWatch, and the Center for Biological Diversity. The listed defen-
                dants include: the United States Department of the Navy; Ray Mabus, Secretary of
                the Navy; the United States Department of Defense; and Ashton Carter, Secretary
                of Defense. The plaintiffs are claiming that the Navy violated the National
                Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 USC. §§ 4321 et seq., when it failed to evaluate
                the environmental effects of military tests in an initial Environmental Impact
                Statement (EIS) relating to the permanent stationing of thousands of United States
                Marines on the island of Guåhan and the proposal to conduct live-fire training for
                those Marines on the islands of Tinian and Pågan in the Commonwealth of the
                Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), as related to the Pacific pivot foreign policy.
                According to the complaint, the Navy failed to</p>

                <p>Evaluate in a single environmental impact statement (EIS) the impacts of both
                permanent stationing of Marines on Guam and the training on Tinian and
                Pågan the Navy claims those Marines will need to perform their national se-
                curity mission. In addition to segmenting illegally the environmental review of
                its Guam and CNMI Military Relocation project, the Navy further violated its
                NEPA duties when it refused to consider alternative locations outside of the
                Mariana Islands where the Marines could accomplish their mission with far
                fewer adverse impacts. (King-Hinds, 2016)</p>

                <p>The Navy is in violation of the NEPA by failing to evaluate the “connected actions”
                between the build-up in Guam and the training in the CNMI or to evaluate the im-
                pacts of the proposed training at the same time into a single EIS. Therefore, the
                plaintiffs asked the court to have the 2010 and 2015 Records of Decision (hereafter
                ROD) regarding the Marine relocation from Okinawa to the Mariana Islands vacat-
                ed and set aside. Earthjustice attorney, David Henkin, who, along with Tinian-based
                attorney Kimberlyn King-Hinds, represents the plaintiffs, reminded the media that
                the “Navy has made a decision to move 5,000 Marines and their families to Guam
                without any consideration of the destruction from live-fire training the Navy claims
                those Marines will need or of other places those Marines could be trained with far
                fewer impacts (Pang, 2016).⁴⁵</p>

                <p>If the ROD were removed, it would halt the build-up on Guåhan as well, since the
                projects are in fact dependent on each other, despite the DOD sidestepping that
                claim (Dumat-ol Daleno, 2016). Craig Whelden, formerly of Marine Corps Forces
                Pacific, said the plans to boost the presence of Marines in Guam and increase train-
                ing in the CNMI were separate. “They are not directly related, they are indirectly
                related,” he said. “Marines stationed on Guam need a place to train” (Hofschneider,
                2016a). However, the attorney Henkin stated,</p>

                <p>The Navy blatantly violated those mandatory legal duties when it decided to
                station Marines on Guam without any consideration of the destruction from
                live-fire training the Navy claims those Marines will need or of other places
                those Marines could be trained with far fewer impacts (Pang, 2016).</p>

                <p>Delegate Gregorio “Kilili” S. Sablan, the CNMI nonvoting representative in the US
                Congress, supports the “right of concerned citizens and community groups in the
                Marianas to raise grievances” through the NEPA. He also recognizes that the islands
                play an important role for “national defense” of the US and that is “why two-thirds
                of Tinian, major portions of land in Saipan, and the entire island of Farallon de
                Medinilla (FDM) have been leased to the federal government for military purposes”
                (Dumat-ol Daleno, 2016).</p>

                <p>Florine Hofschneider of the TWA said that, “when the Northern Marianas agreed
                to remain part of the United States [entering into the Covenant to Establish a
                Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United
                States of America in 1975], destroying the northern two-thirds of our island [Tinian]
                with live-fire training and bombing was never part of the deal” (Jones, 2016). Her pro-
                tection and defense resist the proposed high-impact training involving rockets and
                grenades planned for 20 weeks per year and “non-live-fire” activities for 22 weeks a
                year because of their impact on future generations.</p>

                <p>The Indigenous Chamorro and Refaluwasch families who once called Pågan home
                will be prevented from returning if Pågan becomes a target for bombing practice
                4 months a year. Whelden claimed that high-explosive munitions would “only be
                used on the volcanic hull area of Pågan,” while the wide beaches are perfect for am-
                phibious exercises (Hofschneider, 2016a). The groups state in a complaint that such
                military training poses “existential threat” for the Guardians of Gani' and others
                who advocate a return to “a more traditional, productive and fulfilling lifestyle.” The
                Guardians and their members view Gani', the islands north of Saipan, as the “last
                frontier to revive their traditions and culture” (Sputnik News, 2016).</p>

                <p>While the issues of high-impact and live-fire training are beyond the scope of the
                Covenant, and the military already uses two-thirds of Tinian and all of No'os, the
                women are adamant in resisting the additional acquisition of Pågan. Attorney
                King-Hinds is determined to use her Indigenous knowledge(s) and honor of cul-
                tural frameworks, as well as her legal power and Western education, to protect and
                defend the Mariana Islands.</p>

                <p>In May 2017, the <em>Pacific Daily News</em> reported that the lawsuit “threatens training
                operations in the CNMI” (Limtiaco, 2017). Marine General Robert B. Neller said it
                would be a “problem” if the lawsuit ultimately killed the firing range plan for Guam
                Marines” (Olson, 2017). Now is the waiting period for the next EIS document to be re-
                leased since the DOD has “agreed to perform an additional analysis of the potential
                environmental impacts,” (Hofschneider, 2016a). A new document is expected “later
                this year” [2017] according to Marine General Neller, and a Record of Decision is
                expected in summer 2018 (Limtiaco, 2017; Hofschneider, 2016b). The current military
                activity along the Korean Peninsula also complicates the build-up plans, perhaps
                postponing them for years to come (Radio New Zealand, 2017).</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion of Fanachu Famalåoʼan:<br/>
                Women's Resistance to Militarization in the Northern Mariana Islands</strong><br/>
                This chapter analyzed three women-led written and visual resistance efforts encom-
                passing digital, legal, political, and spiritual elements. The Change.org petition, a
                form of written and digital resistance addressed to Washington DC politicians, was
                “signed” by over 120,000 people beyond the archipelago and picked up by the (inter)
                national media (see Figure 3). The YouTube solidarity video, a form of visual resis-
                tance portraying political, legal, and spiritual messages, was created by a Guam high
                school girls' class and was linked on digital sites through hashtags (see Figure 4).
                The third example, the community lawsuit against the DOD, is the most recent form
                of written legal and political resistance to militaristic expansion in the Marianas ar-
                chipelago (see Figure 5). The combination of digital and legal organizing is growing
                the nonviolent and organized resistance. The strategy is to continue to follow the
                lawsuit, and prepare for the release of additional DOD plans and EIS documents.</p>

                <p>Women are honoring their ancestral knowledge(s) to protect their communities and
                defend their sacred and scarce land and seascapes from further US militarization.
                Their resistance combines digital technologies and new media platforms to foster
                fluidarity (solidarity) and unity between Guam, Tinian, Saipan, and the Gani' islands
                (the Northern Mariana Islands). Through digital, political, and legal resistance, they
                are visualizing and imagining alternative futures for the Mariana Islands as places
                to re-establish spiritual practices with eco-tourism possibilities. This is part of the
                long-term and continuous involvement of many dedicated mothers, sisters, aunties,
                grandmothers, educators, politicians, and friends in the Marianas. Because mili-
                tarization is a step-by-step process, so is demilitarization. These women understand
                that refusing any form of the military is not possible (just yet), but they apply legal
                pressure to enforce previous promises and agreements. The pending lawsuit is the
                most effective form of contemporary resistance.</p>

                <p>Chamorro and Refaluwasch women's approaches of honoring their matrilineal her-
                itage, respecting family genealogy, and cultivating the connection to the land and
                seas provide strength. It is through Chamorro and Refaluwasch epistemologies that
                they resist the devastation of US militarized security protection.</p>

                <head>May I Borrow Some Soy Sauce? The Changing Dynamics of Neighborly Interactions in Rota (Ajani Burrell)</head>
                <p>The story of Rota is, in many ways, the story of the Commonwealth of the Northern
                Mariana Islands (CNMI), and in a broader sense, the story of colonial territories in
                modernity. After the first European visitor to the Marianas in 1521 (Russell, 2002, p.
                23)—a brief stopover by Ferdinand Magellan as he attempted to circumnavigate the
                globe—the people of the region experienced over 400 years of colonial occupation.
                For the last half century, life has also been dominated by an external power, the
                United States. Today, the CNMI is a US territory, affected as much by globalization
                and the technical revolution as any other place on Earth. And yet, the story of Rota—
                and that of the CNMI—has its own inimitable threads.</p>

                <p>The main road from the airport to the historical population center of the island,
                Songsong village, runs along the northern coastline. On one side, jagged rocks jut
                from turquoise water. Fronted by foliage—coconut, palm, papaya, noni—and fore-
                grounded by the expansive blue of the Pacific, the shoreline is pockmarked by rocky
                beaches. On some of the beaches stand thatched or concrete canopies covering picnic
                tables and barbeque grills. Both the beaches and the gathering areas are almost
                always empty. On the other side, the land rises in a series of raised limestone plateaus
                overrun by more emerald foliage. Perhaps most notable along this drive, apart from
                the tranquil beauty, are the hand-painted signs welcoming everyone—residents and
                visitors alike. One such sign admonishes passersby of the “Aluf Luta” (the Rota Wave),
                which helps explain why the drivers of the two or three cars that pass wave as they
                go by, and why, as one quickly observes, nearly everyone in Rota, whether driver or
                pedestrian, does the same. Recently designated its own two-week celebration period
                in August, the Rota Wave is a celebrated part of the island's culture and emblematic
                of the people's hospitable disposition.</p>

                <p>This hospitable disposition was on full display as I went around speaking with
                people during my two visits to the island. I asked them what they thought about
                life today, or whether they had noticed any changes in the past few years. Common
                themes abounded. Most people lamented the loss of some of the more traditional
                elements of the island's culture. In this case, the traditional culture is best understood
                as the customs and practices of the local population, which is still overwhelmingly
                Chamorro and infused with some of the traditions wrought by several centuries
                of colonial influence, most notably Spanish. The traditional culture, many fear, is
                dying out. The Chamorro language is spoken less and less with each subsequent
                generation—its place usurped by English. Notions of respect (respetu) are being
                supplanted by Western ideals. Manngingi', the practice of taking an elder's hand and
                sniffing it in a show of respect, is decreasing in prevalence. Instead of manngingi', if
                there is any display at all, a simple kiss on the cheek (casually referred to as åmen)
                often suffices. The cultivation and consumption of traditional foods has also been
                waning, as have other practices such as traditional healing, and skills including
                basket weaving, fishing, and canoe building.</p>

                <p>These circumstances, however, are not unique to Rota. Similar developments have
                taken place across the Marianas (and other parts of Micronesia) to varying degrees.
                They are also, in some way, the more notable aspects of cultural loss. It is easy to
                understand and appreciate that a language is dying, or that certain skills are no
                longer being widely transmitted from generation to generation. I had come to Rota
                in hopes of identifying some aspect of the contemporary culture that is quintessen-
                tially and ineffably Rota. On my second trip, I stumbled across a potential subject.
                For many people in the CNMI, Rota occupies a special place in the culture of the
                region. As more than one person has said to me, Rota is home to the purest form of
                Chamorro culture left in the Marianas. The reasons for this can, in part, be traced
                back over hundreds of years. The divergence between Chamorros of Rota and those
                of the other inhabited southern islands in the Mariana chain—Saipan, Tinian, and
                Guam—originates in their different fates under the so-called Spanish period (1521–
                1899), which Russell (1994; 2002, p. 23) breaks up into an “alternate historic chronology
                for Rota” that includes three shorter periods: Protohistoric (1521–1668); Reducción
                (1668–1700); and Isolated Spanish Outpost (1700–1899). The Roman Catholic Church
                created a lasting foothold in Rota and the rest of the Marianas during the Reducción
                period, bringing with it the decline or disappearance of many traditional Chamorro
                practices (Russell, 1998, p. 318). The reducción included the forced relocation of the
                Indigenous people from the northern islands to Guam. In this, only Rota was spared,
                and by 1722, when the last of the Chamorro families from Saipan were relocated to
                Guam, Rota was the only other inhabited island of the Marianas (Farrell, 2011, p. 75).
                The reducción also included the forced relocation of Chamorros “from traditional
                settlements to mission villages,” which also served to undermine Indigenous cul-
                ture by upending “traditional land-use practices” and ensuring “that non-Christian
                practices were efficiently stamped out” (Russell, 1998, p. 317).</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the impacts of the reducción and subsequent
                historical eras were not quite as disruptive in Rota as in Guam. Though Rota contin-
                ued to have a regular missionary presence, reports from those missionaries suggest
                infrequent visits from outsiders, whether Spanish delegations from Guam or vessels
                from other nations (Russell, 2002, p. 38). Carlos Madrid (2014), in his case study of
                Rota's Casa Real, presents evidence that the inhabitants of Rota publicly voiced
                their displeasure over abusive practices by the Spanish Governor of the region, and
                suggests that “Christian names were not used on a daily basis, at least not by the
                people of Rota” (pp. 49-50). Other, later evidence also suggests a minimal Spanish
                presence in Rota during the Isolated Spanish Outpost period. Census figures
                from 1758 indicate 244 “Native Indians” living in Rota, but register no “Soldiers” or
                “Spanish and Filipinos.” By comparison, the figures for Guam are 1467, 170, and 830,
                respectively (Lévesque, 1999, p. 265). Madrid (2014) also reports that over a century
                later, the people of Rota continued to resist attempts by government officials to re-
                locate the Indigenous population to Guam (p. 50). Rota's isolation was such that for
                much of this time the island was a refuge for Chamorros fleeing Spanish oppression
                elsewhere in the chain (Russell, 2002, p. 33). This isolation seems to have continued
                through the German administration as well (Russell, 2002, p. 39), with the “German
                administrative presences as exercised by German nationals” limited to Saipan,
                except for a brief period from 1904-1906, and on average roughly just one official
                visit to Rota per year on behalf of the administration (Spennemann, 2008, pp. 6–8).</p>

                <p>For a number of reasons, the relative isolation of Rota has continued to the present.
                This is not to say that the island was without dramatic cultural shifts and influenc-
                es. Rather, given its relative inaccessibility and smaller population, it seems Rota
                experienced comparatively less impact on its culture than the other islands. One
                metric that helps underscore this comes from recent demographic data. The 2010
                US Census indicates that Rota is the only island in the chain that, as of that year,
                had a population that was majority Chamorro (CNMI Department of Commerce/
                Central Statistic Division, 2012, p. 8). In 2010, approximately 37% of the population
                of Guam were of Chamorro origin (Guam State Data Center Bureau of Statistics
                and Plans, 2012, p. 24). In Tinian, that figure is about 38%. In Saipan, only 22% of the
                population were of Chamorro origin (and 26% overall were of Northern Marianas
                descent—either Carolinian or Chamorro), but in Rota, nearly 52% of the population
                were of Chamorro origin, more than double that in Saipan (CNMI Department of
                Commerce/Central Statistic Division, 2012, p. 8). Another metric that helps charac-
                terize this unique place in the region comes from the 2016 CNMI Household Income
                and Expenditure Survey Report (HIESR), which indicates that in both 2005 and 2016
                Rota had the second highest percentage of households speaking Chamorro at home
                (43.8% and 37.8%, respectively) of all the districts in the CNMI. Rota's rates are about
                double those for the CNMI as a whole (21.5% and 18.6%, respectively). Rota is also the
                only island of the three inhabited islands in the CNMI where a plurality of the house-
                holds spoke Chamorro in both 2005 and 2016 (CNMI Department of Commerce/
                Central Statistic Division, 2017, pp. 21–22). These figures suggest that Rota has been
                able to retain a more Chamorro identity than its neighbors have been able to.</p>

                <p>Despite seeming to retain a stronger Chamorro identity than the other Mariana
                islands, Rota has still undergone cultural changes, both big and small. During one
                of my visits, I spoke with Magdalena Mesgon, the Director of the Department of
                Community and Cultural Affairs (DCCA). She revealed a more nuanced dynamic
                than many others I had heard, but one perhaps no less telling about the culture
                today. We were in her air-conditioned office, in what used to be the island's high
                school, a far cry from the hot, humid weather outside. We had been chatting for a
                while, when I asked her, again, whether there was anything different about Rota be-
                tween today and the recent past. She paused for a few moments. “People today,” she
                eventually said, “don't go and ask their neighbors for favors anymore” (M. Mesgon,
                personal communication, December 12, 2017).</p>

                <p>I asked her what she meant. She explained that in the past, if you ran out of salt or
                soy sauce or eggs and needed it at that moment, you could just go over to the neigh-
                bors or send one of the kids to borrow what you needed. But today, people did not do
                that anymore. “Do you still do this?” I asked. “No,” she said, a sad smile on her face.</p>

                <p>I was surprised. Shocked even. I almost did not believe it, given what I had learned of
                the people and customs of Rota. Surely, an island with less than 3,000 inhabitants, a
                place where everyone professed to know pretty much everyone else, where one way
                or another you were related to half the island, including many of your neighbors, a
                place as welcoming and friendly as Rota, where you wave to everyone you pass on
                the street, such a place would not have lost the practice of asking a neighbor for a
                small favor in a pinch? Surely that could not be the case, could it? It must just be her,
                right? “I think most people don't do this anymore,” she replied. I decided to find out.</p>

                <p>To standardize the exchanges, I simply told people that I was researching pres-
                ent-day culture in Rota and asked if I could pose a few questions. I would start with a
                hypothetical, based on the dynamic Magdalena shared: you're at home cooking and
                you realize you've run out of something essential—soy sauce or salt or eggs; would
                you go to your neighbors to borrow the item? Of the dozen people I spoke with, only
                one answered unequivocally in the affirmative. For everyone else, the answer was
                usually a “no” or a qualified “no.”</p>

                <p>The negative responses I received fell along a spectrum. A few people indicated that
                the decision to borrow a missing item “depended on the neighbor.” If a neighbor was
                a close family member, they were more comfortable asking for a favor, but they would
                not ask a more distant relative or neighbors without a relationship to the family. For
                many others, the answer was an outright and often emphatic “no.” A few people I
                encountered at the airport before leaving Rota said, pointedly, that they do not ask
                their neighbors for favors. Two women I interviewed at the DCCA offices assumed
                they had misunderstood what I was asking, leading to the following exchange:

                Woman 1: “I thought you were going to say about asking for soy sauce or what
                in the neighborhood.”
                Me: “Yes, literally.”
                Both women laugh.
                Woman 1 (with look of mild horror on her face): “Oh-oh-oh, okay.”
                Woman 2 (shaking her head): “No, we don't do that now.”
                Me: “So, that is a thing?”
                Woman 1: “Back then, yes. Now, no.”</p>

                <p>A local man in his early 20s, whom I had met at the Chenchon Park Bird Sanctuary,
                was even more blunt. The sanctuary encompasses a rocky coastline and dense
                foliage that stretches to the ocean. Birds soared and dipped on a brisk breeze, but
                otherwise, the park was tranquil in the bright midday sun. Under a gazebo perched
                atop the cliffline, I posed the hypothetical to him: would he borrow some small item
                from a neighbor? “Fuck no,” he said, shaking his head. “No way.”</p>

                <p>As people shared their thoughts with me on this issue, I would, as a follow-up, ask
                why they (and people in general) would not ask a neighbor to borrow some small
                kitchen item. Almost every person indicated that the reluctance came from a sense
                of pride or shame. As I reflected on my exchange with the young man at the bird
                sanctuary, and on my conversations with other people on the subject up to that point,
                it was difficult for me to understand how this practice could be associated with pride
                and shame. I also struggled to understand the strength behind the reactions shared
                by people I spoke with. Often, I could see the discomfort in their faces or in their
                body language. It was as though even being asked the question subjected them to
                some sort of shame. The young man was visibly distraught by the suggestion that he
                might need to ask his neighbor for a favor.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most confounding aspect of this phenomenon was how at odds it was
                with historical and even current perspectives of the people living in Rota. As an ex-
                tremely isolated outpost for much of its history, including the post-WWII period,
                the Rotanese as a group were almost entirely self-reliant. Their survival depended
                on communal sharing. As one Chamorro manåmku' (elderly person) told me, up
                until a couple of decades ago, it did not matter if supply ships came or if there was
                food in the stores or not. The people grew and caught the food they needed. Today,
                if the ships did not come, people would starve, but historically, the self-reliance and
                sharing culture of the island was sufficient for survival. Another Chamorro manåm-
                ku' I spoke with, named Tony, said much of the same thing. Interestingly, one of the
                first things Tony shared before I could even pose the standard hypothetical, was that
                in the past “you can just go to your neighbor and ask for salt or sugar or whatever
                you need … but now no more.” She explained it this way:
                Before we don't really need money because we don't have money them days, but
                we work and share things so if you need something then I can share it with you
                if I have it … but nowadays if you don't have anything, you don't have money,
                you're going to die because nobody provide you … When I was growing up that
                how I know how people live. In the morning, they don't have, you know, not too
                many people have matches to make fire, so we usually use wooden stove and
                we use fire, we have to make fire, so whoever first make fire, on the neighbor,
                then the next neighbor will come over and ask for fire, even the fire they ask,
                so they go there and get the coconut shells and make fire, and the next one
                that sees you smoking then they will come over and get fire, but those are the
                difference. Now no more.
                Given this background, it seems strange then, that in a couple decades, a prac-
                tice once considered normal, commonplace—necessary even—would become a
                near-anathema riven with shame.</p>

                <p>This circumstance becomes even more confounding in light of other, related prac-
                tices still evident today. Several people, as we discussed this particular development,
                also indicated that key components of the sharing culture still exist. The earnest
                young man I spoke with at the sanctuary told me that if he goes fishing or hunting
                and comes home with a good catch, he will keep some for himself and his immedi-
                ate family then divvy up the rest to share. With whom? His neighbors. He said he
                would take a few pounds to each of his neighbors. And his neighbors would, in turn,
                do the same with their fish, meat, fruit, or vegetables. But would he, in light of this
                fact, go to the neighbors for some salt or soy sauce, I asked. “Never,” he replied. He
                was not the only person to mention this dynamic, as several people I spoke with said
                they too regularly shared excess food from harvests or catches with their neighbors,
                and their neighbors with them. Similarly, the people of Rota, perhaps because the
                community is so small and most people are acquainted, have a strong sense of com-
                munal trust. I had noticed as I was driving around that there is a nearly complete
                absence of “Private Property” or “No Trespassing” signs posted on people's land.
                Coming from Saipan, a larger island where it sometimes seems every other property
                posts such signs, this struck me as interesting. I asked people about it, and they said
                no one uses those signs because everyone knows everyone, and more importantly,
                they trust one another. The reluctance, then, to borrow from one's neighbor from
                time to time is difficult to reconcile in light of such dynamics.</p>

                <p>Another interesting aspect of this phenomenon is the relative speed with which it
                has become ubiquitous. While responses differed among people regarding when
                this practice changed for them, almost everyone I spoke with indicated that the
                change had come within the last generation. Most of the people I interviewed were
                middle-aged, and most told me that they could definitely remember times as a child
                or adolescent when their parents or grandparents sent them to the neighbors for
                some missing cooking item. But this was not just limited to those who were mid-
                dle-aged. The young man at the bird sanctuary could also remember times in his
                youth when his parents or grandparents sent him on similar errands. For others, the
                conversion was even more recent, and occasionally they could pinpoint the exact
                time at which they realized the change was upon them. Magdalena, the Director
                of DCCA, recounted a conversation with her son from a few years earlier. She had
                asked him, one day before he left for the military if he could “go to the neighbor and
                ask … for some foil because I'm wrapping something for my potluck.” He turned
                around, shocked, and said “Mom, are you not ashamed?” Surprised, she said no,
                she was not ashamed, and called the neighbor and asked about the foil. The neigh-
                bor was perfectly happy to share and said to send over the boy to pick it up. Her
                son refused and she had to pick it up herself. After that, she too stopped asking her
                neighbors for these sorts of favors. In this regard, she is not alone. I began asking
                people when they thought this behavior changed, and for many, while they still
                might have gone to the neighbor 10 years ago, nearly everyone that I asked said they
                would not have gone to the neighbor 5 years ago. This seems to suggest that in the
                span of a decade or less, the practice of going to one's neighbors to ask a favor has
                significantly decreased in prevalence.</p>

                <p>Much uniformity existed in people's description of their own behavior in these
                situations. Similarly, there was a pervasive belief that most other people felt and
                acted the same way (interviewees noted that their neighbors did not come to them
                anymore either to borrow these small items). And while there was also a relatively
                uniform belief that the underlying cause of this change is a sense of pride or shame,
                the possible explanations for why this change has manifested varied more widely.
                What follows is a brief description and commentary on some of the possible causes
                of this phenomenon as identified by Rota residents.</p>

                <head>Economic Shifts</head>
                <p>Several people believed that, in some way, economic factors contributed to the de-
                velopment. I found it remarkable that during several interviews, when respondents
                considered why people stopped asking favors of their neighbors or why there might
                be a sense of pride or shame in doing so, a fear of being viewed as unable to provide
                for themselves was articulated. In the words of one interviewee, “You have a job with
                a high salary and you need to ask me for salt?” Another said the neighbors would
                think, “She just got paid yesterday. She can't even buy ketchup?” This feeling seems
                to suggest that as more people acquire gainful and reasonably well-compensated
                employment, they should be able to afford these necessities. That people might not
                have these necessities would thereby imply they were somehow irresponsible with
                their finances, rather than a simple coincidence that one unexpectedly ran out of a
                basic item. Economic data from the CNMI might provide additional evidence sug-
                gesting this phenomenon took root around a decade ago and has since strengthened.
                The first decade of the 21st century in the CNMI was a period of growth, followed by
                a rapid downturn in the economy that reached a nadir in the aftermath of the global
                housing market collapse. Since that time, the local economy—in Rota and the wider
                CNMI—has steadily grown. Between 2005 and 2016, Rota saw an overall increase in
                employment of more than 10%, according to the 2016 HIES report, while the CNMI,
                as a whole, saw a similar decrease (though this decrease is largely due to the closing
                of the garment industry). A higher percentage of workers in Rota are employed by
                the government than in the other islands, though this percentage decreased over
                that same period. The data are somewhat mixed in that it seems more people are
                employed today than they were a decade ago, but the median and mean incomes for
                Rota have decreased significantly over that same period, much more significantly
                than for the CNMI as a whole (CNMI Department of Commerce/Central Statistics</p>

                <p>Division, 2017, pp. 24-29). This could suggest that while more people are working,
                money for households has become more scarce, which might explain why people
                have such a sense of shame if they need to ask a neighbor for a favor.</p>

                <head>Americanization</head>
                <p>The rising influence of American values was another oft-cited contributing factor
                to this phenomenon. As people shared their perspectives, the American values in
                question seemed to be those of capitalism, individualism, and self-reliance rather
                than the more traditional communal values of the islands. When I asked Tony
                why so many people no longer asked their neighbors for favors, she said, “Time[s]
                change, everything change[d], money talks and bullshit walks.” Her sentiment,
                and use of this quintessential American trope, was echoed by several other people,
                and she was not the only person to utter, verbatim, this saying. Other people also
                mentioned that they or their family members had, in the last few decades, spent a
                significant amount of time in the United States working, studying, or living with rel-
                atives, which invariably impacted their worldview and practices. This is increasingly
                the case for the islands, as more and more Indigenous people move to the mainland
                for better education and employment opportunities, bringing back with them some
                of the values acquired during their time away. The degree of cultural decline in the
                islands may well be seen as proportional to the degree of American influence in
                those islands. Guam, by most accounts, has undergone the greatest deterioration of
                Indigenous culture (it has been a US territorial possession for over a century and is
                home to large US military installations), while Saipan in the CNMI has seen it less
                so, and Rota the least.</p>

                <p>Another way to consider the impact of Americanization (and to a degree the next
                topic, modernization), is according to age. As I spoke with people about this phe-
                nomenon, I noticed a strong correlation between age and intensity—a kind of age
                gradient. Younger people expressed the most resistance to the idea of asking their
                neighbors for favors, and thereby tended to exhibit the most shame at the prospect
                of doing so. Magdelena, the Director of DCCA, had indicated that her son was the
                reason this matter came to her attention, and her recounting of the experience would
                indicate that his resistance and shame over asking a neighbor for a favor was intense.
                So too, for the young man I spoke with in the bird sanctuary. At the other end of the
                spectrum, manåmku' were more likely to view such behavior as acceptable, while
                people of middle age tended to present a more mixed set of feelings. It would seem
                that the more steeped in American and modern ways a person is, the more likely he
                or she is to find the practice of asking neighbors for favors objectionable.</p>

                <head>Modernization</head>
                <p>Some impact on this phenomenon also comes from the inevitable effects of mo-
                dernity, including the technological revolution and globalization. Though more
                indefinite in its parameters or effects, the role of modernization cannot be under-
                stated, in particular the rise of the internet and social media. Several interviewees
                mentioned, with dismay, the potential criticism or slights on social media they
                might receive were they to go to their neighbors for a favor. The inevitable gossip
                that happens in communities, coupled with the wider reach of social media and the
                increasing prominence of full-time employment in the islands, seems to have made
                this a potent barrier to earlier modes of neighborly interaction.</p>

                <head>Demographic Shifts</head>
                <p>The composition of neighborhoods, of whom one might have as neighbors, has also
                been changing over the past several decades in Rota. Several people mentioned the
                likely impact of familial dispersion as a cause of this behavior change. As recently as
                20 years ago, it was likely that many of one's neighbors were not just family, but close
                family—parents and offspring, siblings, first cousins. More recently, as people come
                of age, they often move away from the principal residence to start their own fami-
                lies. This movement, whether to another island or the US mainland, or to another
                village or part of the village in Rota, means that more people are living in proximity to
                people who are not family or close relations. Tony indicated that was very much the
                case for her family: “In our culture, the Chamorro culture … the families are really
                close … and people surrounding they're just like family, but now: no more.” Later, she
                went on to say, “I live by myself right now. And that's one thing that's hurting me. I'm
                all by myself, nobody is coming to see me or keep me company. Before, they used to
                give the mother, the grandmother, to borrow their kids to be with, but now no more.”</p>

                <p>One factor in this dynamic is the CNMI Village Homesteading Program. The pro-
                gram, a consequence of Public Law No. 1-42 and promulgated in 1979, provides
                homestead lots to persons of Northern Marianas descent who meet certain crite-
                ria. According to the office of the Rota District of the Department of Public Lands
                (personal communication, February 14, 2018), several villages in Rota are almost
                exclusively comprised of homestead lots, and over 1,000 homesteads have been
                allotted to date. These figures, given Rota's population, account for roughly half
                of all homes. The lots are typically created in undeveloped areas, and are awarded
                randomly via lotteries, further increasing the chance of someone having neighbors
                who are not close familial relations. This lack of familiarity—despite knowing one's
                neighbors and their daily routines, as one person mentioned—could contribute to
                the sense of pride or shame one might feel in asking for a favor.</p>

                <p>We may never know why, ultimately, the practice of asking one's neighbors for a
                favor—once so common in the small, communal society on Rota—seems to be
                dying out. While the reasons offered by residents themselves are logical and com-
                pelling, the dynamics are complex. There are also some lingering conundrums,
                such as why the aversion to this practice seems to have so quickly spread, or why this
                particular practice seems to be so associated with America and American values.
                With regard to this study, it also suffers from sample size limitations, in particular
                a lack of socio-economic diversity. Most of the people I interviewed were gainfully
                employed. Perspectives might differ among the unemployed or underemployed, or
                in more rural parts of the island, where people are not so directly integrated into the
                economy and workforce.</p>

                <p>Despite this lingering uncertainty, a few truths remain. The first is that this phe-
                nomenon seems to have taken hold within a significant portion of the population on
                Rota, and that this change is a divergence from previous practice. While the degree
                to which it has taken place may be up for debate, as well as its prevalence among the
                younger people, one other truth remains and is perhaps even more consistent: sad-
                ness. The people of Rota with whom I spoke about this phenomenon were almost
                universally saddened by it. They felt that they were losing an essential element of
                their culture. A couple even wondered aloud what it meant or what else they might
                be losing but are unaware of. As the small prop plane for my thirty-minute flight
                home taxied down the runway and lifted off, the seats behind me filled mostly with
                jovial Rota residents making a trip to Saipan for a Christmas work party, I felt a
                sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach stronger than the mere Newtonian pull
                of the plane against gravity. It felt like loss. And sadness. </p>

                <head>Militarism and Sovereignty in the Contemporary Northern Mariana Islands (Theresa “Isa” Arriola)</head>

                <p>Every few weeks in the CNMI, the US military publishes an inconspicuous notice in
                the local newspapers that include the dates and times they will be using the northern
                island of Farallon de Medinilla or FDM (No'os in Chamorro)⁴⁶ for target practice.
                FDM is located approximately 45 nautical miles (80 km) north of Saipan in the
                Marianas archipelago and has been used as a live and inert range by the Department
                of Defense since 1971 despite being home to a number of bird species including the
                endangered Micronesian Megapode (Megapodius laperouse) (Lusk et al., 2000).
                During the drafting of the CNMI Covenant, FDM was to be used for defense respon-
                sibilities and cost the military a total of $20,600.⁴⁷ The DOD currently maintains
                an active lease with the CNMI Government that began in 1983 and has an option to
                renew for another 50 years (Hofschneider, 2016). Due to the military's testing, fishing
                vessels, tour operators, and the public are advised not to enter the general location
                of the maneuvers which includes up to 12 nautical miles around the island. These
                notices are published fairly often but quickly fade into the background to make way
                for other more pressing news stories. I draw attention to this particular notice as a
                way to highlight how militarization promotes a routinization of violence that is easily
                glossed over as a necessary component of the political agreement between the CNMI
                and the United States rather than an ongoing and contingent negotiation.</p>

                <p>This chapter's main intervention within this line of argument then is to disrupt the
                common narrative that sovereignty was “given up” for United States citizenship at
                the time of the CNMI Covenant's creation and that military planning is a “necessary
                evil”⁴⁸ that we bargained for when we signed the 1975 Covenant agreement. Rather
                than accepting the Covenant as a stranglehold on future discussions of our political
                status and increased militarization, I instead call the concept of sovereignty into
                question beginning at the time of the creation of the Covenant agreement⁴⁹ in an
                attempt to reconceptualize the sociopolitical potential of sovereignty for our people.
                In doing so, I advocate for indigenizing sovereignty (Nadasdy, 2017)—a perspective
                that is grounded in an Indigenous epistemology of land, and I argue that processes
                of decolonization must examine the role of militarism in shaping the trajectory of
                Indigenous sovereignties throughout the entire Marianas. This is a vision of sov-
                ereignty as dynamic and emergent: sovereignty measured by how well Indigenous
                peoples in the Marianas are empowered to maintain ownership and control over
                their lands, rather than sovereignty defined by political status. I draw on historical
                documentation regarding the CNMI Covenant throughout the CNMI community,
                contemporary discussions regarding political status in news media, informal inter-
                views, and participant observation in Saipan from 2016 to 2020. I draw heavily from
                theories of sovereignty within Indigenous and Native Studies to critique the conven-
                tional understanding of Euro-American sovereignty and explore its possibilities for
                our political presents and futures in the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

                <head>Indigenous Sovereignty</head>
                <p>Sovereignty is a fraught topic that is both political and personal, particularly as it
                pertains to Indigenous peoples who continue to negotiate its meaning within the
                context of settler societies where juridical notions of sovereignty often contradict
                notions of Native sovereignty. In order to work through this contradiction, Teves et
                al. (2015) ask “Is Native sovereignty the same sovereignty articulated within Western
                political discourse?” and “If not, can Native peoples rearticulate sovereignty given
                its ideological baggage?” (pg. 3). These questions raise important insights into the
                meaning of sovereignty within the context of Indigenous political systems nested
                within United States political frameworks (A. Simpson, 2014). In these contexts,
                Euro-American conceptions of sovereignty continue to dominate the sociopolitical
                narratives while simultaneously undercutting Indigenous political systems that do
                not fit neatly within the bounds of its definition (Deloria, 1979).</p>

                <p>In its most conventional and popularized form, sovereignty is defined primarily as
                “Supremacy or pre-eminence in respect of excellence or efficacy”; a second defini-
                tion is, “Supremacy in respect of power, domination, or rank; supreme dominion,
                authority, or rule” (Oxford, n.d.). By definition the state is characterized as having
                enough power to exist independently and “regulate one's own internal functions
                in the field of domestic relations” (Deloria, 1979, p. 22). The state is presumed to be
                the apex of power and even “the precondition for politics” itself (Nadasdy, 2017, p. 3).
                Sovereignty then as a concept is inseparably enmeshed with the production of the
                “modern” nation state, in which the nation is viewed as a supreme authority that
                rules over an easily demarcated or bounded territory. The roots of this concept can
                be traced back to the Enlightenment and the Age of Discovery, and is “directly tied to
                the need to codify and regulate the practices of conquest and the settlement of lands
                with peoples deemed uncivilized—and hence unsovereign” (Bonilla, 2017, p. 332).</p>

                <p>The history of colonization within Indigenous communities flips the definition of
                sovereignty on its head by highlighting how the term is both historically contingent
                and dynamic where Indigenous expressions of sovereignty are often in direct con-
                frontation with the state and even precede European conceptions (Nadasdy, 2017).
                As Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) scholar J. Ke'haulani Kauanui (2017) has point-
                ed out, “Any discussion of sovereignty is sure to entail competing epistemological
                frames, and thus different ontological orientations and diverse political forms in
                theorizing our political present” (p. 326). Sovereignty is therefore negotiable, fluid
                and ever-changing, yet deeply meaningful and real. At any particular moment in
                history, the term means different things to different peoples, but has tremendous
                capacity to inform Indigenous political life and futurity through its possibilities.
                Defining sovereignty is therefore an exercise in power itself and is a form of ne-
                gotiation rooted in one's experience within a changing society and especially in
                the context of decolonization. Indigenous perspectives have much to offer to the
                concept of sovereignty because of the ways that they both transform and challenge
                traditional statist ideologies that envision statehood as a political end goal.</p>

                <head>Sovereign Limits</head>
                <p>Indigenous theorists have long recognized the inherent limits of employing
                European concepts of sovereignty to understand the politics of Indigenous nations,
                territories, and commonwealths where sovereignties are deeply interdependent
                (Cattelino, 2008), emergent (Uperesa and Garriga-López, 2017), nested (A. Simpson,
                2014), entangled (Nadasdy, 2017), paradoxical (Kauanui, 2018), and interact with stat-
                ist ideologies in complex ways. Many of these political arrangements exist outside
                the normative notions of a sovereign nation-state and defy the “universal norm” of
                sovereignty (Bonilla, 2013). This is because for many Indigenous peoples, sovereignty
                is not simply a political concept but “is at its core about relationships—relationships
                with each other and with plant and animal nations, with our lands and waters and
                with the spiritual” (L. Simpson, 2015, as cited in Hiller and Carlson, 2018, p. 49). Such
                perspectives reveal the political possibilities and limitations of sovereignty and
                have been a critical component of theorizing Indigenous political resurgence, resis-
                tance, and negotiation against colonial concepts of sovereignty that seek to codify
                Indigenous political systems and forms of governance (Trask, 1999).</p>

                <p>Because of these historical complexities and competing epistemological positions,
                I do not attempt to define sovereignty within Chamorro and Refaluwasch commu-
                nities, but to examine the stakes of contemporary renderings of sovereignty in the
                Northern Mariana Islands, particularly amidst ongoing militarization—a process
                that is often in direct conflict with movements towards the protection of Indigenous
                land. This examination requires an unsettling of current assumptions that un-
                dergird definitions of sovereignty and decolonization in the context of the CNMI
                Covenant, as well as in the context of Indigenous theory-making more broadly. For
                the territories and commonwealths that are popularly characterized as living under
                United States sovereignty, such as Guam and the CNMI, these realities are often
                complicated by the fact that the United States does not view itself as an empire and
                “is often presented as an exception to the colonial model of state power” (Uperesa and
                Garriga-López, 2017, p. 39). The mere existence of places like Guam and the CNMI
                in the political imaginary as we know them today, like other “discontiguous States
                of America” (Lai, 2011), do much to trouble this perception of exceptionalism and
                debunk this myth about American history (Kiste, 1993, p. 66).</p>
                
                <p>On February 15, 1975, when the CNMI Covenant was signed, a headline in the New
                York Times read, “The United States signed a covenant today that will eventually
                make the Northern Marianas [sic] Islands in the Pacific a commonwealth, under
                American sovereignty, much like Puerto Rico” (“Pact”, 1975). As an unincorporated
                territory, under American sovereignty, these designations secured a political dis-
                tancing between the CNMI and the United States that continues to characterize our
                contemporary social and political relationship. Sovereignty in the CNMI is therefore
                complicated by the fact that federal legislation can supersede local self-governance,
                despite the fact that self-governance implies a level of political autonomy (at least in
                theory) to the people of the Northern Marianas. This legal paradox has led to much
                debate within United States legal circles, leading one legal analyst to question, “…
                in the event of an irreconcilable conflict arising between the Northern Marianas
                people and the United States government regarding an internal matter of the CNMI,
                who must prevail?” (Horey, 2003, p. 182). In reference to this ambiguity within the
                CNMI Covenant, Horey (2003) writes that there was no “suggestion or agreement as
                to precisely how, as a practical matter, local self-government would be secured from
                federal interference. The only agreement was that, somehow, it would” (p. 241). This
                legal quandary is relevant to the contemporary context of troop “repositioning” in
                the Pacific as part of the ongoing military build-up as the superseding of federal leg-
                islation over local laws has historically occurred because of increased militarization
                in the name of national defense. This quandary also calls into question the very
                notion of ownership over marine resources, submerged lands, and other “federal-
                ized” spaces such as marine monuments within the United States Insular Areas in
                the context of militarization. As Bonilla (2017) explains, to define the boundaries of
                its territory, nation-states rely on certain “territorializing assumptions” and “consti-
                tutive exclusions” that define who can and cannot become part of the nation.</p>

                <head>(Un)incorporated into the Nation</head>
                <p>The United States designation of islands as insular territories to be administered by
                the War Department's Bureau of Insular Affairs in the late 19th and early 20th cen-
                turies is one such form of demarcation. By including the category of unincorporated
                territory into the political vocabulary, territories remained in spaces of “liminality”
                and “deferral” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 15). This has manifested in what Fallon (1991)
                argues is an “ambivalent, if not antagonistic, attitude toward granting independence
                to these territories” (p. 31).⁵⁰ Such designations, which produced a sense of being
                half in and half out of political decision-making, is evident in the juridical recogni-
                tion of territories as “foreign … in a domestic sense” when discussions surrounding
                the much-debated Insular Cases were under way (Burnett and Marshall, 2001; Kaplan,
                2005) In reference to Puerto Ricans, Amy Kaplan (2005) describes this legal para-
                dox as a “limbo in space and time” that allows the United States to interpret the
                political futures of the territories and commonwealths in ways that both deny them
                the ability to become a state but also the ability to become an autonomous nation
                (p. 3). Kaplan's (2005) analysis in The Anarchy of Empire in the Making of US Culture
                highlights how such paradoxes are not anomalies at all, but rather part and parcel
                of United States' empire building and that far from being contradictory, the foreign
                and the domestic are co-constitutive (p. 4). By touching on the Insular Cases in this
                discussion, my point is not simply to re-hash the imperial and racist roots from
                which these legal opinions and juridical categories have sprung. Instead, I wish to
                highlight how these discourses pervade current discussions of self-determination
                among the Chamorro and Refaluwasch people in the CNMI by framing sovereignty
                as subsumed by and through United States political frameworks.⁵¹ The legacy of
                the Insular Cases continues to provide the foundation for the flourishing of other
                imperial formations (Stoler et al., 2007) that do not easily fit within the context of
                colonialism as it is typically imagined. One such manifestation in our contempo-
                rary world is the assimilationist discourse of inclusivity into an “American political
                family.” Such discourses have long been detrimental to Native peoples whose strug-
                gles are framed within the context of exclusion/inclusion into the broader nation
                state (Byrd, 2011, p. xxv) and work to foreclose Indigenous political imaginaries.</p>

                <p>Assimilation into a broader American political family was an influential narra-
                tive employed in early Covenant negotiations between the United States and the
                CNMI in the early 1970s. The Marianas Political Status Commission of 1974 de-
                scribed this commonwealth union as “the name given to a self-governing political
                entity which is closely attached to another, larger political unit such as a nation.”
                Between 1972–1974, there were five rounds of CNMI Covenant negotiations before
                the Commonwealth Bill was signed into law (US Public Law 94-241) by US President
                Gerald Ford on March 24, 1976 (McPhetres, 1997, as cited in Babauta and Babauta,
                2008, p. 5). During this time, assimilationist discourses that aimed to incorporate
                the CNMI into a United States political structure provided powerful narratives that
                influenced Covenant negotiators in Saipan, which was considered the capitol island
                of Micronesia at the time. For example, the Honorable Edward De Leon Guerrero
                Pangelinan, Chairman of the Marianas Political Status Commission (MPSC) at the
                time, understood Indigenous relations with the United States as something that
                both expanded economic opportunities and provided a sense of incorporation into
                a broader American social, political, and economic family. He explained,
                    As citizens, we enjoy the benefits of being part of the richest and strongest
                    nation in the world. The geographic boundary of the CNMI is no longer limited
                    to the boundaries of the island's lagoon, it extends from the CNMI to American
                    Samoa to Hawaii, the continental United States and to the American Caribbean
                    of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Our lands are the most beautiful and
                    scenic spots on this planet. And what about the communities we have built—our
                    cities, towns, counties, villages and the length and breadth of our country. And
                    finally, the diversity of our people, the Indigenous Chamorro/Carolinians, all
                    are now members of a much larger community of over 300 million Americans.
                    We all benefit from the various cultural and ethnic diversity of our American
                    population. (Babauta and Babauta, 2008, pg. 5)</p>

                <p>Mr. Pangelinan's statement links a diverse array of other United States territorial
                “possessions” with the continental United States through their incorporation
                into an American political system that he frames as “ours.” In the CNMI, where
                Chamorros and Refaluwasch are often simultaneously understood and self-identify
                as both Indigenous and American, assimilationist discourses are often recapitulated
                through civil rights frameworks transplanted from the United States of America that
                effectively erase indigeneity through the racialization of Chamorro/Refaluwasch
                people as an ethnic group within America. Such discourses continue to be produced
                through the expansion of federal policies via militarization today and have profound
                consequences on contemporary Indigenous politics where the power to retain
                control over Indigenous lands as the ancestral people of the Northern Marianas is
                complicated by the legal designation as American citizen.</p>

                <head>Linking Sovereignty to Decolonization</head>
                <p>Sovereignty is fundamentally linked to decolonization since it involves a critical
                re-thinking of how we envision who we are as a people and how we envision the
                future of our political systems, particularly in relation to the broader American
                nation. It entails an unsettling (Bonilla, 2017) of who we are as Indigenous peoples in
                today's world where decolonization is commonly associated with state-sanctioned
                processes that often link political independence with a complete disconnection from
                larger nation states. Sovereignty is thus linked to our relative political agency or abil-
                ity to continue to negotiate our political futures, much like our community did in the
                early days of the Covenant negotiations when questions surrounding the exercise of
                our political power were surfacing. Yarimar Bonilla's (2017) preference for the term
                unsettling as opposed to decolonizing is instructive here since it “avoids the telos of
                decolonization. What is unsettled is not necessarily removed, toppled or returned
                to a previous order but is fundamentally brought into question” (p. 335). The term
                “unsettling” is a useful analytic to employ in the Pacific where many islands remain
                technically de-colonized, but remain under US hegemony (Pöllath, 2018) and where
                some—such as Guam—remain on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing
                Territories (NSGT). In this light, it is helpful to understand decolonization less as
                a linear political process with a defined end goal than it is to view it as a dynamic
                and transformative process situated at the complex intersection of sociopolitical and
                historical circumstances.</p>

                <p>In the context of United States-CNMI relations, sovereignty remains an inroad
                for exploring contemporary changing social dynamics in the Marianas and to
                unpack the ways that United States sovereign power is asserted over local political
                decision-making via the powerful sociopolitical influence of militarization. An ad-
                equate examination of our political futures must engage with the influential power
                of militarization on our islands, where United States hegemony manifests itself in
                ways that are not always so obviously tied to traditional concepts of colonialism. As
                Na'puti (2013) points out,
                Today colonial control and imperial rule no longer manifest in overt and hostile
                taking of land as was common in the era of European colonialism. Instead, colo-
                nialism operates in more covert ways, through the control of labor markets and
                neoliberal reforms and by exerting military and political pressures through-
                out the globe. (p. 56)</p>

                <p>Amidst increasing militarization, processes of decolonization can be understood less
                as breaks from the trajectory of larger nation state building, and more a site of polit-
                ical contestation and ongoing negotiation with the United States. Yet the prospects
                of re-negotiating the CNMI's political status with the United States often led people
                in Saipan to ask me, “if not the United States military, then who?” In other words,
                how could we possibly survive, “who would we even be, without the United States?”</p>

                <p>This phrase was usually followed up by an assertion that if it were not for the United
                States presence here on our islands, we would be overtaken or threatened by another
                nation like China or North Korea—a narrative largely promulgated by the conver-
                sations surrounding the United States' Pacific Pivot that capitalizes on the threats
                posed to the Marianas from the Asian continent. While I do not seek to downplay the
                real dangers that have been asserted against the islands by countries such as China
                and North Korea, I do want to contextualize our islands' involvement in the broad-
                er geopolitical and military strategy between nation states whose priorities center
                around the promotion of defense goals rather than Indigenous sovereignty.</p>

                <head>Creating a (Trust) Territory, Defining the Common(wealth)</head>
                <p>What does decolonization mean when Indigenous homelands have been reconfig-
                ured as American territory and where decolonization is foreclosed by commonwealth
                status? Furthermore, how do we define “the commons” in a territorial possession?
                In his essay entitled “Against death maps of Empire: Contesting colonial borders
                through Indigenous sovereignty,” Eric Ritskes (2015), writing about Jodi Byrd's con-
                cept of the commons, asserts,
                Byrd (2011) recognizes indigeneity as a necessary obstacle to ‘the commons'
                as a means of decolonization because the commons is conceptualized on and
                through lands stolen from Indigenous peoples; the idea of the commons was
                not only always exclusionary, as Kim Christen (2012) argues, but always already
                embedded in colonial dispossession.</p>

                <p>In the case of the CNMI, Indigenous experiences living in an unincorporated
                territory push the limits of the terms like “decolonization” in productive ways by
                challenging what it means to be part of a broader commons defined by a larger
                nation state. What decolonization actually means in a United States territory⁵²—
                where the full spectrum of constitutional rights is not present—has long been up
                for debate. Fallon (1991) expands on the paradoxical nature of this political agree-
                ment when he writes,
                    The necessary basis of equality is missing because the islands do not have equal
                    representation in the US Congress, the inhabitants of the Northern Marianas
                    cannot vote for president, the islands may be subject to federal laws not applicable
                    to the states, and the legislature of the “Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas”
                    does not conform in its structure and nature to the state legislatures. (p. 29)</p>

                <p>The various United States territorial statuses of the islands that comprise the Pacific
                therefore exist within a “murky” political zone “lying between formal statehood
                and official independence” (Fallon, 1991, p. 23). As a commonwealth—a term which
                in itself is rather nebulous⁵³ —the people of the CNMI opted for a closer political
                union with the United States that recognized local self-government, but in many
                ways privileged United States citizenship.</p>

                <p>Discussions surrounding decolonization in the Marianas are complicated by the
                meaning of colonization itself, especially in the CNMI, where United States political
                hegemony is often framed as a necessary component of securitization in the region
                rather than a form of occupation. Banivanua-Mar (2016) argues that this perspective
                was exemplified by the US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson's characterization
                of the Pacific Islands as critical defense “outposts” to detract from the problematic
                use of the label “colonies.” (p. 117) Thus, Northern Marianas history is convention-
                ally understood as moving in teleological fashion from conquest to colonization to
                self-government. Importantly, colonization in the case of the Northern Marianas
                usually refers to Spanish, German and Japanese occupation, rather than the United
                States, which is commonly viewed as a nation state that negotiated with the CNMI
                rather than as a colonizer. It has been argued, for example, that the Northern
                Mariana Islands were “no longer true colonies” (Horey, 2003, p. 21) under the juris-
                diction of the League of Nations, since the Indigenous peoples were seen as desiring
                to integrate “American ideals of democracy, equality and popular sovereignty … and
                that there be a break from the colonial past, not a continuation of it under anoth-
                er name” (Horey, 2003, p. 242). From this perspective, the creation of the Covenant
                symbolized for many in the Northern Marianas a move towards incorporation into a
                broader nation that signified the end of colonization, rather than another beginning.</p>

                <p>Having been framed in the language of self-determination, the ideological and polit-
                ical transformation of the Mariana Islands, from its status within the Trust Territory
                of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) to a United States commonwealth, also symbolized for
                many an exercise in sovereign power that had not been afforded under any other
                previous colonial regime. As Chamorro legal scholar Nicole Torres (2012) points
                out, “the CNMI acted as a sovereign in negotiating the Covenant with the United
                States, which specifically acknowledges the CNMI's inherent sovereignty.” (p. 173)
                This process is viewed as a distinguishing political feature between the CNMI and
                the largest and southernmost island of Guam, which is undergoing a political status
                education campaign regarding a formal path to decolonization through the United
                Nations due to its non-self-governing territorial status.⁵⁴ While the 1950 Organic Act
                granted US citizenship to those living in Guam, it allowed for only a limited form
                of “self-government” and one non-voting delegate in Congress. Thus, the CNMI's
                political status can be viewed as “temporalized in a moment” (A. Simpson, 2010) and
                the Covenant codified sovereignty by framing it as something that was given up in
                favor of citizenship.</p>

                <head>The Sovereignty/Citizenship Trade-off and the Dependency Dilemma</head>
                <p>In an attempt to learn more about the perception of sovereignty as something that
                was traded for citizenship during Covenant negotiations, I conducted an interview
                with Chamorro lawyer and sovereignty scholar Mr. Robert Torres from Saipan. I
                began by asking Mr. Torres about his views regarding the history of sovereignty and
                its implications for contemporary society in the CNMI. He responded,
                you ask yourself … when has a people ever had an opportunity for true inde-
                pendence and forsake independence and bargain away their own sovereignty in
                favor of a favorable political relationship with its former trustee … never … this
                commonwealth was a kind of anomaly in this history, and so Guam never had
                an opportunity to negotiate for this.</p>

                <p>In his explanation, Mr. Torres frames this unique history as one in which we entered
                into a bargaining relationship with the United States as a former trustee by giving up
                our sovereignty. CNMI historian Samuel McPhetres (1997) also notes this agreement
                in his popularly referenced history book entitled Self-Government and Citizenship in
                the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. He explains that this decision
                was an act of self-determination by a sovereign Indigenous population who
                voluntarily opted for union with the United States knowing that they had inde-
                pendence as an alternative. It was the first time that this had ever happened in
                the history of the United States.</p>
                
                <p>Despite the fact that the Marianas was not considered self-governing at the time,
                the decision to enter into a political union with the United States was viewed as
                an act of “inherent sovereignty” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 48). Guam on the other hand
                was viewed as never having had the opportunity to participate in such a historical
                moment. Given this fact, I continued to inquire as to why independence was such a
                controversial idea at the time.

                    T.A.: It's interesting that independence was immediately associated with having
                    no connection with the United States, like you are turning your back on the
                    country. I'm curious as to why independence was so controversial.
                    R.T.: The majority of people did not see independence as the path of opportu-
                    nity, progress or development … The fact of the matter is, when we bargained
                    for the Covenant, we signed onto a deal that wholesale adopted the American
                    system of governance, laws and jurisprudence and economic benefits and every-
                    thing. We did. And now it can't be terminated unless there is a mutual consent
                    provision which it's obviously not going to happen that the United States would
                    have a mutual agreement to terminate the Covenant … so we have to now work
                    within a system of laws and rules and finances that is affected by US policies, on
                    immigration, on labor, on an environment, and as the ebb and flow goes in the
                    United States so too goes the CNMI … So we bargained for this, and we signed
                    on for it and that's the deal we made.</p>

                <p>In his discussion, Mr. Torres highlights the deep legal entanglements that have
                emerged from the Covenant negotiations. While the mutual consent provision
                offers us a level of protection against unlawful Congressional power, Indigenous
                political lives are now so inextricably linked to United States political systems
                that the implementation of the provision is now often viewed as an impossibility.
                Covenant expert and co-author of An Honorable Accord: The Covenant Between the
                Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, Howard P. Willens (2003) explains
                that the CNMI's political arrangement is both “constitutional and successful” and
                that the mutual consent provision “protects the Northern Marianas people from
                having the fundamental terms of their relationship with the United States being
                unilaterally altered by the US Congress—as Congress is presently free to do with
                respect to Guam and the other US territories” (p. 376). I highlight Willens' analysis
                here to point out that while contemporary debates surrounding the CNMI's polit-
                ical status center around issues of US constitutionality, this analysis misses out on
                the broader issue of dependency that militarism produces. Put another way, legal
                provisions—even the ones meant to protect the CNMI—cannot be divorced from
                the broader history of imperialism throughout the Marianas, where US military
                goals remain preeminent. Without contextualizing the history of the Covenant in
                this way, arguments over whether or not the CNMI's status remains constitution-
                al will do little to expand the horizons of decolonization in the Pacific. Chamorro
                scholar Michael Bevacqua (2017) has characterized the similar situation in Guam
                as a “decolonial deadlock,” which people liken to suicide, and can be described as
                “a discursive formation that circles around the idea that the best possible political
                and social configuration in Guam has already been reached through its colonial re-
                lationship to the United States and that hence, nothing more need be done” (p. 107).
                In the CNMI, discussions surrounding the Covenant often foreclose possibilities for
                future dialogue about Indigenous futures by placing a stranglehold on discussions
                of decolonization. The formation of commonwealth in the CNMI and territorial
                status in Guam are viewed as meaningful political arrangements that make it diffi-
                cult to speak about our contemporary relations with the United States as imperial
                in nature. This stifling of the political imagination also frames decolonization as a
                simplified “choice between national independence in isolation and emancipation
                in association or integration with the colonizing power” (Heim, 2017, p. 915). In the
                CNMI, our militarized legal entanglements with the United States remind us that
                decolonization has never been a simple question of what is legal or not.</p>

                <head>The Limits of a Commonwealth Status</head>
                <p>In 2008, the US Congress federalized the CNMI immigration system despite the
                CNMI government's popular disapproval of this legislation. One year earlier, at a
                hearing before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, David B. Cohen
                (Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs) testified that while the CNMI had
                made improvements to working conditions since the 1990s, serious concerns over
                homeland security, human trafficking and mistreatment of refugees throughout the
                islands still remained. For these reasons, Cohen concluded that with the help of
                the US Congress, the CNMI's immigration system must be federalized as soon as
                possible through the passing of bill S.1634, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant
                Implementation Act. This was an important moment for the people of the CNMI,
                who lacked representation in Congress yet were being subjected to federal oversight
                over immigration policies that were seen as failing. While Cohen was clear about
                the need to federalize, his statement also highlighted the inequitable political rela-
                tionship between the US and CNMI. He explained,
                    we're concerned about the message that would be sent if Congress were to
                    pass this legislation while the CNMI remains the only US territory or com-
                    monwealth without a delegate in Congress. At a time when young men and
                    women from the CNMI are sacrificing their lives in Iraq in proportions that

                    far exceed the national average, we hope that Congress will consider granting
                    them a seat at the table at which their fate will be decided. (United States/
                    CNMI Political Union, 2007)</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the federalization process, CNMI residents remained uneasy
                about what this controversial change meant in terms of federal encroachment over
                local laws even amidst the criticism of the local government's failings.</p>

                <p>In a Marianas Variety article entitled “CNMI Lawmaker Advises Review of US Ties,”
                CNMI Representative Stanley T. Torres framed the issue in terms of an unequal re-
                lationship between the US and the CNMI. He crafted House Bill 17-7, calling for the
                creation of a Second Marianas Political Status Commission that would re-evaluate
                this political relationship. In a telling interview, Torres stated,
                    [the] timing is very right to bring this proposal up because it appears that the
                    federal government has been screwing us for a long time … The feds give us
                    money but instead of letting us make the best use of it ourselves, they put a lot
                    of restrictions. (Erediano, 2011)
                Torres' comments reflect the CNMI's inability to adequately exercise the right to
                self-government, and similar sentiments continued to remain a theme into the mid-
                2000s as US military planning burgeoned alongside these concerns. In 2015, House
                Bill 19-2 was submitted⁵⁵ to the Nineteenth Northern Mariana Commonwealth
                Legislature. In short, the bill was titled the Second Marianas Political Status
                Commission Act of 2015⁵⁶, whose purpose was to reinvigorate the call to create a
                Second Marianas Political Status Commission
                that the people desire to reexamine whether continuing, in a “Political Union
                with the United States of America” under the Covenant is in their best interest,
                or whether some other political status will better enable them to fulfill their
                hope and aspirations in attaining full and meaningful self-government, as stated
                by the late US Senator Jacob Javits of the State of New York in the deliberations
                of the Covenant and as amended.</p>

                <p>Recognizing that the current political time in which we find ourselves no longer
                accommodates the CNMI's desires for self-determination, the goal of the Second
                Marianas Political Status Commission was to meaningfully engage in discussions
                regarding contemporary political relations with the United States. Authored by Rep.
                Felicidad Ogumoro (R-Saipan), the CNMI Senate passed the House bill by a vote of
                6-1 on December 19, 2014. The Commission consists of nine voting members and two
                non-voting ex-officio members, including two persons from Rota, two from Tinian,
                and five from Saipan. The bill came on the heels of a number of important chang-
                es in the CNMI, among which “Submerged land control, rampant militarization,
                and the federal immigration takeover” ranked as the most pressing (Chan, 2016).⁵⁷
                Arguably, while all three political concerns are presented as separate issues, they
                can be viewed as falling under the same umbrella of militarism.⁵⁸ In an interview
                about her experiences regarding the authoring of House Bill 19-2, Rep. Ogumoro
                (personal communication, July 6, 2020) explained,
                The US continues to make policies without proper consultation and if there is
                consultation and we say no, just like in the case of the military … when we are
                trying to make a point … they keep going, as if we are talking to the birds.
                Having personally heard her express similar concerns about the Covenant in past
                gatherings, I inquired about her experience with the Covenant negotiations as well.
                According to Rep. Ogumoro (personal communication, July 6, 2020), she explained,
                look back into the reports even in our books, it only took … oh my gosh … less
                than a year … such a short time for public education for the people to under-
                stand what the Covenant really means. You see what is happening now for the
                other [Pacific] entities such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau and
                the Federated States of Micronesia … they are on equal footing with US … with
                us, the US is speaking on our behalf and that is so obvious when we go to the
                United Nations … we sit behind the US and they speak on our behalf.
                Rep. Ogumoro's sentiments echo the much longer resistance that existed in Saipan
                to accepting commonwealth status as the best option for the people of the CNMI.
                In particular, it has been noted that the Saipan Women's Association (SWA) and the
                United Carolinian Association (UCA) were vocal opponents of the Covenant while
                major support came from the Marianas Political Status Commission (McPhetres,
                1997, p. 54). This history is helpful for understanding how resistance to political ne-
                gotiations with the US has historically manifested itself among different groups in
                ways that do not always fit neatly into a pro-US narrative.</p>

                <p>In a Saipan Tribune article entitled “Meaning of Covenant Questioned,” John
                Tagabuel, executive director of the Carolinian Affairs Office, stated that the “US is
                treating us like a US territory” (Chan, 2016) like Guam or Samoa, which are non-gov-
                erning entities. In comparing our status to Guam, Mr. Tagabuel's comments reveal a
                number of complex social and political realities that continue to shape discussions
                of Indigenous self-governance in the Marianas. First, as previously mentioned, as a
                commonwealth, the CNMI is viewed as having more political autonomy than the
                neighboring island of Guam, which remains on the UN list of Non-Self-Governing
                Territories (NSGT). Similarly, Tagabuel's comments reveal the relative political disad-
                vantage that American Samoans, as American nationals (as opposed to US citizens),
                have in comparison to those living in the Northern Marianas. This perspective has
                also frequently been brought up by Saipan residents in personal conversations when
                referring to Guam's political status by stating, “At least we are a commonwealth.”
                In fact, when applied to the CNMI, the label of territory is considered offensive to
                some since it elides important differences between the CNMI and Guam regarding
                self-governance. At a public presentation about the legal status of the US territories
                in which I was in attendance on Saipan in 2018,⁵⁹ John Gonzales (president of the
                Northern Marianas Descent Corporation) stated that to call the CNMI a “territory is
                an insult … who went through a process unlike any other” islands in the region. In
                this regard, commonwealth status is often a mark of distinction that is upheld as a
                source of pride for the people of the CNMI.</p>

                <p>In legal terms, the designation of commonwealth status along with the creation of
                the CNMI Covenant, the Constitution, and the ensuing political union with the
                United States bestow upon the CNMI a level of political autonomy that simply is
                not present in many other “territories.” In fact, in a 1975 plebiscite vote to become a
                US commonwealth, the Indigenous populations of the Northern Mariana Islands
                were understood as the only people ever known to have “voluntarily opted for
                union with the United States knowing that they had independence as an alterna-
                tive” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 57). This autonomous decision was understood as an “act
                of self-determination by a sovereign Indigenous population” (McPhetres, 1997, p. 57)
                and is tied to the fact that the political union between the CNMI and the United
                States could not be altered unless by agreement on behalf of both parties. This was
                defined as a mutual consent agreement (or mutual consent clause) written into the
                Covenant as a way to thwart an abuse of power should it ever arise. As a result, Guam
                is sometimes upheld as an exemplar of what the CNMI does not want in regard to
                self-determination, as its official status remains an unincorporated, organized ter-
                ritory in which the Organic Act of 1950 was imposed upon the island. As Mr. Rudy
                Sablan in the Saipan Tribune, explained,
                    There exists a misconception about our CNMI. Many people believe that be-
                    cause we are a commonwealth, we belong to the United States, as if we are
                    property or territory of the US Wrong. We don't belong to the USA. Neither the
                    US Congress, nor the US President, has yet to agree that we are a US-owned
                    territory. The CNMI is not just US soil. (Chan, 2016)</p>
                <p>Legal scholar Horey (2003) has argued that politically this has been an outcome of
                the “overall federal tendency … to ignore the unique circumstances of the CNMI, and
                lump it together with the traditional US territories” (p. 182). Both Mr. Tagabuel and
                Mr. Sablan point out the inherent contradiction between the CNMI's self-government
                and US sovereign power over the CNMI's political system, a paradox that continues
                to frame contemporary discussions of sovereignty in the CNMI, with one prevail-
                ing view being that US citizenship as a worthy trade for sovereignty. This political
                history is important to re-examine in light of contemporary discussions of self-de-
                termination amidst the steady growth of military planning in the region, wherein
                Indigenous self-governance is couched within the framework of US sovereignty.</p>

                <head>The Politics of Indigeneity</head>
                <p>Contemporary media coverage of the Mariana Islands tends to center around a few
                salient themes: US political controversies⁶⁰; the lack of democracy being extended
                to the United States' territorial possessions; and more recently, the devastating ef-
                fects of unprecedented typhoons hitting “US soil.”⁶¹ Although seemingly disparate,
                these themes overlap in complex ways and point to the inextricable links between
                America's imperial reach and its ensuing militarization of the environment. This
                coverage seeks to portray a more inclusive and historically accurate representa-
                tion of United States imperial history in US territories where most inhabitants are
                Indigenous peoples who do not possess the same constitutional rights as American
                citizens in the continental United States. It also highlights the general unfamiliarity
                that most Americans have in regard to United States territories, which engenders a
                sense of disbelief that such political arrangements continue to exist in today's world
                where overt forms of colonialism are no longer acceptable.</p>

                <p>On the March 8, 2015 airing of HBO's “Last Week Tonight,” John Oliver picked up on
                this discrepancy and noted that, while
                more than four million people live in the US territories, more than 98% of them
                are racial or ethnic minorities, and the more you look into the history of why
                their voting rights are restricted, the harder it is to justify, ‘cause it goes all the
                way back to when America first acquired them. (Last Week Tonight, 2015)
                By framing Indigenous people in the territories as racial or ethnic minorities that
                live in places that were “acquired” by the United States, Oliver's comments reflect
                a common practice of racializing Indigenous peoples (Moreton-Robinson, 2015)
                in an attempt to underscore the unequal application of democratic rights to all
                Americans. While his sketch was informative of America's imperial reach outside
                the continental United States, it continues to highlight the complex political reali-
                ties that Indigenous people in territories and commonwealths must negotiate under
                American political hegemony that cannot be solved by voting rights.</p>

                <p>Such perspectives portray a lack of political representation—specifically inequita-
                ble voting rights⁶²—in an American system of governance as the root of the islands'
                many social and economic issues. Increasingly, democratization and a growing
                American consciousness are understood as the panacea to the many social and po-
                litical problems facing the people of the Marianas. I argue that while the critique
                of unequal political representation is well founded, it highlights state-centered
                approaches to decolonization that define political and social equality through
                the granting of US citizenship and incorporation—a move in which democracy is
                viewed “as the ever-heralded justification and decisive promise of inclusion in set-
                tler states more broadly” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 20). From this perspective, statehood is
                upheld as the apex of assimilation into a seemingly homogenous American political
                system—a prospect that presents itself as a legal paradox in overseas insular territo-
                ries⁶³ (which include the CNMI, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa and
                Puerto Rico) in which “the promise of statehood” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 16) existed but
                never manifested through their designation as unincorporated.⁶⁴ As Stayman (2009,
                as cited in Pöllath, 2018) points out, “The status of ‘unincorporated territory' meant
                that fundamental individual rights were protected by the Constitution, but Congress
                need not extend citizenship nor extend a promise of eventual statehood” (p. 237).</p>

                <p>Thus, militarism overlaps with the politics of indigeneity in the CNMI in a number
                of important ways. First, processes of self-determination complicate the politics of
                indigeneity across the archipelago, where decolonization for Chamorros in Guam,
                and for Chamorros and Refaluwasch in the CNMI both overlap and diverge due to
                our different colonial and political histories. Secondly, Chamorros and Refaluwasch
                peoples must contend with authenticating and differentiating their indigeneity
                against the background of Americanization. Indigeneity overlaps with racial politics
                and highlights the influence that settler legacies of racial purity and blood quantum
                have over the authentication of Indigenous peoples. Lastly, militarism forces both
                groups to reckon with the sometimes tenuous and paradoxical nature of having
                two groups fall within the same category of Northern Mariana Descent (NMD)—a
                category that often becomes conflated with indigeneity in the CNMI.</p>

                <p>One of the most important consequences of the differential military and political
                histories of the Northern Marianas and Guam in terms of Indigenous self-determi-
                nation has been the formal recognition of two groups of people into the category of
                Northern Marianas Descent: the Chamorro and Refaluwasch peoples. The emer-
                gence of an “Indigenous” label surfaced among Chamorros in the 1980s in Guam as
                a response to issues of self-determination (Tolentino, n.d.). In the CNMI, however,
                indigeneity is often conflated with the legal categorization of “Northern Marianas
                Descent” which designates those individuals who meet the requirements of Article
                XII in the Northern Mariana Islands Constitution. Article XII is entitled “Restrictions
                on Alienation of Land” and is comprised of six main sections. In Section 4, a person
                of Northern Marianas Descent is defined as,
                a citizen or national of the United States and who is of at least one-quarter
                Northern Marianas Chamorro or Northern Marianas Carolinian blood or a
                combination thereof or an adopted child of a person of Northern Marianas de-
                scent if adopted while under the age of eighteen years.</p>

                <p>For purposes of defining Northern Marianas descent, a person shall be con-
                sidered a full-blooded Northern Marianas Chamorro or Northern Marianas
                Carolinian if that person was born or domiciled in the Northern Mariana
                Islands by 1950 and was a citizen of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands
                before the termination of the Trusteeship with respect to the Commonwealth
                (Commonwealth Law Revision Commission, n.d.).</p>
                
                <p>The definition of NMD, taken directly from the experience of the drafting of the
                CNMI Constitution during the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) period,
                used a combination of time, location, and political status as guidelines for identi-
                fication of Indigenous peoples in the CNMI. This designation was important for
                the way that it linked the deeply meaningful and ancestral ties to the land with
                Indigenous people. Given the long historical use of blood quantum as a tool for
                discrimination against Indigenous peoples globally, the use of blood quantum to
                define NMDs might appear somewhat contradictory. However, a closer examination
                reveals that the use of blood quantum to define indigeneity need not be discrimi-
                natory and, in fact, can work to promote Indigenous self-determination (Villazor,
                2010, p. 476). This is an important distinction to make in the context of US political
                hegemony in the Pacific where Indigenous rights create counter-claims against US
                constitutional rights such as “equal protection and individual rights” (Villazor, 2018,
                p. 128).⁶⁵ In the CNMI, the definition of NMDs highlights the complexity of both in-
                digeneity as a political and social category that intersects with a broader American
                national identity and citizenship.</p>

                <p>Given this history, the perspectives of Chamorros from Guam often do not address the
                perspectives of Refaluwasch people who re-located to the Northern Mariana Islands
                in the early 19th century after a massive typhoon hit their home islands (Alkire,
                1984, p. 272). Despite evidence of pre-contact relationships between Carolinians
                and Chamorros from Guam (Goetzfridt, n.d.), this contemporary Refaluwasch
                “blind spot” is often unintentionally promulgated by scholarship about Chamorros,
                particularly in Guam, where the same history between Refaluwasch is not shared.
                Camacho (2011) touches on this issue when he notes that
                Guam, in their view, persists as the center of Indigenous injury, thereby fore-
                closing discussion of other “grievable” subjects in the Mariana Islands. The
                Guam-centrism is widespread. That is, the majority of the Catholic debates,
                Indigenous literatures, oral traditions, political issues, popular cultures, and
                women's organizations representing Chamorro society almost exclusively focus
                on Guam, if not portray Chamorros as Indigenous only to this island. (p. 704)</p>

                <p>Teasing out the socio-political differences between Guam and the Northern Mariana
                Islands has the potential to shed new light on longstanding inequities that continue
                to shape our relationship with one another both politically and economically, as
                well as our differential relationships with the United States. Rather than an obstacle,
                these differences can be a key to shaping self-determination as we negotiate var-
                ious legal avenues for demilitarization and decolonization. Although outside the
                scope of this discussion, the differences and similarities between Chamorro and
                Refaluwasch cultures and political histories have much potential for unpacking
                how colonization has influenced our understandings of indigeneity in today's world.
                As Kanaka Maoli scholar Haunani-Kay Trask (1999) points out, “Because of coloni-
                zation, the question of who defines what is Native, has been taken away from Native
                peoples by Western-trained scholars, government officials and other technicians”
                (p. 43). In the CNMI, the shared history between Chamorros and Refaluwasch (or
                mixed “Chamolinians”) remain a site of productive tension in which we can expand
                our visions of Indigenous sovereignty outside the bounds of political recognition.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>How would it be possible to exercise self-determination amidst militarization, if
                only Guam—or if only the CNMI—could technically achieve this goal? What do
                two different political statuses within the same archipelago mean for decoloni-
                zation? In the Marianas, reconfiguring the possibilities of sovereignty are critical
                to confronting United States hegemony. Critiquing the hypermilitarization of the
                region is key to this confrontation because “militarism and militarization both es-
                tablish the conditions of the nation-state and claim justification for their further
                imperial expansion as the defense and redeployment of those conditions and calcu-
                lated disposal of national sacrifice zones” (Goldstein, 2014, p. 9). Militarism works to
                construct the discursive formation of such sacrifice zones, military borders, and stra-
                tegic outposts as necessary to national security through the construction of insular
                environments ripe for testing and training. The undoing of this particular colonial
                framing of sovereignty within the Northern Marianas remains critical amidst on-
                going militarization, a process which continues to uncritically invoke the islands'
                political status, size, and geographic location as justification for increased mili-
                tarization by presenting them as national defense necessities. This perspective also
                allows us to abandon the settler logic of political incorporation and navigate us away
                from the notion that more political representation in Congress necessarily equates to
                increased self-determination. It does so by highlighting the primacy of Indigenous
                relationships through and within our “common wealth”—that is, to recognize that
                our political power lies in the relative ability to care for our ancestral lands, seas
                and skies that make possible our connections to this place, rather than a vision of
                militaristic consumption of island environments based on a loosely defined and
                problematic ideal of a national commons. To recognize the land as an Indigenous
                “common wealth” rather than a US commonwealth means to literally break apart
                the term, wrest back its meanings from its imperial roots, and understand the
                environment and our surroundings as a communal space that we take responsibility
                for protecting rather than exploiting or extracting.</p>

                <p>Since the first plans regarding the military build-up in the Marianas were made
                public in 2005, community members throughout the Marianas expressed concerns
                about militarism as an impediment to decolonization, particularly in Guam. In a
                statement before the UN Special Committee on Decolonization in 2006, Guam
                Senator Hope Cristobal noted the absurd situation that surrounds ideals of self-de-
                termination on an island as militarized as Guam. Cristobal (2006) explained,
                The sheer number of eligible voters connected to the military, their depen-
                dents and contractors is of great concern when implementing the exercise
                of our inalienable right to self-determination in … Guam … Even more dis-
                turbing is the military's attitude that they, too, can vote to decolonize a
                non-self-governing territory! To be sure, the military can surely determinate a
                US favorable outcome of any election.</p>

                <p>Sen. Cristobal's concerns echo the deeply problematic way that self-determina-
                tion is framed in the context of settler colonialism, whereby the distinctiveness of
                Indigenous claims are ignored in favor of a seemingly homogenous American citi-
                zenship. Furthermore, increasing militarization continues to reveal discrepancies in
                the way that the CNMI and Guam can engage with processes of self-determination
                in their distinct political relationships and negotiations with the United States. The
                collapsing of socio-political differences between the CNMI and Guam risks over-
                simplifying the struggle for decolonization as one that can be framed only within
                and through the confines of US legal frameworks. The argument that the CNMI
                was never colonized because we were able to “choose” our political status and that
                we were not a spoil of war as was Guam is testament to this oversimplification. It
                restricts how we might imagine self-determination by linking decolonization to po-
                litical status and depoliticizes the influence of US political power in the archipelago.
                A myopic focus on political status therefore constrains possibilities for demilitarized
                futures. By incorporating the land and environment into discussions of self-deter-
                mination, our viewpoints shift towards a more expansive politics of sovereignty and
                decolonization that is not shackled to military whims throughout Oceania.</p>

                <head>The Evolution of Respeto (Respect) as Viewed through Three Generations of Refaluwasch (Carolinian) Families (Cinta Matagolai Kaipat)</head>

                <head>Respeto</head>
                <p>Respeto (respect) is one of the cornerstones of Refaluwasch (Carolinian) culture.
                It dictates what is considered a culturally appropriate or inappropriate manner of
                interacting with every single being we encounter. For us Refaluwasch, respeto is cru-
                cial to our very survival. Based on my own personal observations, I find that there
                has been a diminished sense of respeto in Refaluwasch culture with each succeeding
                generation. I fear that the continuation of this trend will lead to the rapid extinction
                of this important hallmark of Refaluwasch culture. Why is this important? This is
                important because our culture is what makes us unique; it is what sets us apart from
                other peoples of the world. Moreover, respeto helps restore peace and harmony, both
                within and outside of our own Refaluwasch society. Of parallel importance is that it
                promotes tipiyew—that Refaluwasch “spirit of unity”—of one heart, one mind, and
                one love for all. To lose appreciation for this important Refaluwasch value threatens
                the very survival of our culture and unique way of life.</p>

                <head>My Parents' Generation</head>
                <p>My parents were born in the 1930s during the Japanese occupation of our Mariana
                Islands. I am certain that what my parents learned about respeto growing up in their
                respective households was shaped by their cultural environment, as well as later-life
                influences they experienced as they matured into adulthood.</p>

                <head>My Father</head>
                <p>My father was born to a Refaluwasch father and a Chamorro mother on the island
                of Agrigan (also called Agrihan), one of our remote islands north of Saipan in the
                Northern Islands of our Marianas archipelago. Agrigan was populated almost ex-
                clusively by Refaluwasch at the time my father and his family lived there. That is
                where my paternal grandparents chose to live and raise a family. My father was the
                second to the youngest child in a family of six boys and one girl.</p>

                <p>He was a schoolteacher, a song composer, a farmer, a medic, a traditional local
                healer, a public official, and a congressman. In his younger years, he worked as a
                cook on a ship. My father had the privilege of traveling abroad to pursue his edu-
                cation in places such as Chuuk in Micronesia, Fiji, Hawai‘i, and Japan. I am certain
                this experience further shaped his worldview and helped him become a better com-
                munity leader in service to our people upon his return home from studying abroad.
                His exposure to the outside world honed his skills as a diplomat, enabling him to
                navigate skillfully between the more modern world he ventured into and the more
                traditional world he had been raised in.</p>

                <p>My father was also a visionary who was ahead of his time. He believed in developing
                our islands' natural resources and held strongly to the belief that the peoples' skills
                had to be developed as well as this was a key element in the communities' achieving
                self-sufficiency and economic prosperity. My father returned to Saipan in the early
                1960s after completing his studies at the University of Hawai‘i where he majored in
                agriculture. He was subsequently hired to help run the Agriculture Program in the
                Marianas during the Trust Territory era which began after WWII. It was then that
                he moved our family from Agrigan to Saipan. I was the youngest of five children
                born at that time. In Saipan, we lived in isolation in Chacha, as Kagman Village was
                still an undeveloped farm area back then. My father held this position until he was
                persuaded to run for political office to represent our people of the Northern Islands.</p>

                <p>He won a seat in the Legislature and moved our family back to the Northern Islands
                and resettled us in Pagan (pronounced “Puhgan”) in the latter part of July 1968. By
                this time, our family had expanded to seven children.</p>

                <p>Although my father was one of the most highly educated men of his time—espe-
                cially for a Refaluwasch or a Refaluwasch-Chamorro—he did not limit himself to
                playing the traditional male role common in Refaluwasch society. On the contrary,
                upon returning from one of his trips to Saipan to attend a Congressional session, or
                when he would return home after an off-island trip to Japan or Hawai‘i to engage
                his contemporaries on agricultural matters, he was often seen carrying one of my
                younger siblings on one hip while stirring a pot on the stove. He even improvised a
                wood-burning oven so that he could bake bread!</p>

                <p>I was 10 years old when we tragically lost my father. He was murdered in April 1972,
                while protecting a constituent who sought refuge at our house one night following
                a domestic dispute. I mention my father's death because I include in this writing
                what I learned from him about respeto as I was growing up, although most of the
                discussions on this subject will be lessons passed on by my beloved mother, who
                lived to the age of 75, just 2 months shy of her 76th birthday, before we lost her,
                too, in April 2010.</p>

                <head>My Mother</head>
                <p>My mother was born in Saipan to Refaluwasch parents. She was raised by a single
                mother. She was an only child before a half-sister came along a few years later. It
                would be a few more years later before her mother would marry and give birth to
                her youngest half-sister and half-brother. Mom began her formal education during
                the Japanese administration. She got as far as second grade under the Japanese ed-
                ucation system. Like a typical Refaluwasch family, my mother grew up in a humble
                home where money was hard to come by. Her mother was a tall curly-haired stern
                woman. Much of her beliefs and teachings were passed on to her by my maternal
                grandmother and other relatives.</p>

                <p>My mother's family lived in Chalan Kanoa in Saipan prior to moving to Agrigan
                after the end of WWII. As the eldest, she helped take care of her younger siblings.
                Mom worked hard to take care of her family. She continued this “life work” after she
                and my father were married and started a family. She was pregnant with her tenth
                child when my father was killed. While she never took a job outside the house, the
                “life work” my mother assumed raising all 10 children on her own after my father's
                death was nothing short of remarkable. She was the glue that held us together when
                our world was suddenly shattered after my father's death. We owe my mother a debt
                of gratitude that can never ever be repaid. She was an incredibly strong role model
                who believed in and lived by the Golden Rule. There is no doubt that she left the
                biggest influence in shaping our lives.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My siblings were born in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. I was born in 1961. I am fond
                of sharing this piece of trivia with new friends. I tell them that the number 5 plays
                a significant role in my life. For starters, my parents had five boys and five girls.
                After having five of us, they waited five years before they had five more children.
                I am the fifth child of the 10 children born to my parents. Five of us were deliv-
                ered at home on Agrigan by our Chamorro grandmother and, finally, I was the fifth
                child that she delivered.</p>

                <p>Speaking of my grandparents, unfortunately, all had passed away by the time I was
                old enough to know and appreciate them. I am sure I would have learned a lot from
                them. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my father's tragic death when I was 10 years old
                not only deprived me of a father, but also robbed me of the opportunity to learn
                so much from him. Hence, most of what I learned about Refaluwasch culture and
                respeto came from my mother as well as other relatives. I thank God for my mother
                and all the relatives who took the time to instill Refaluwasch values and lessons,
                such as respeto, in me and my siblings.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                Members of the next generation include my numerous nieces and nephews
                in my immediate family, as well as other relatives who were born in the 1970s,
                1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.</p>

                <p>I. Ttong (Kissing of the Hand)
                One of the first things children are taught to do in order to show respeto is to kiss
                the right hand of a parent or older relatives. When meeting relatives who are a
                generation or more above you (either while visiting or after church), the first act in
                paying respeto is to walk up to that individual, gently take and raise his or her right
                hand towards your nose as you bend down and kiss the hand and say “Ñora” if the
                person to whom you are according respeto is a female or “Ñot” if the person is a
                male. These are Spanish-origin Chamorro words. I am sure that this practice was
                something picked up from our Spanish colonizers who conquered and subjugated
                my Chamorro ancestors in the 1600s. That my Refaluwasch ancestors share this
                customary act of showing respeto means that they, too, did not escape Spanish subju-
                gation even though they did not settle in the Marianas permanently until the 1800s.</p>

                <p>Refalowasch call this act of according respeto by kissing the hand “ttong.” This act
                is also very important in paying respeto to one's godparents. Being blessed after
                kissing the hand—with the person bestowing the blessing touching the head and
                replying “Liyoos faiyéégh” (God bless you)—is culturally important. It is an import-
                ant symbolic gesture of an ongoing relationship based on respeto. In fact, one of the
                baptismal godparents will also be the godparent at the godchild's wedding. If the
                godchild is a female, then the godmother will be involved in the wedding ceremony,
                and vice versa if the godchild is a male.</p>

                <p>There are certain situations when a “proxy godparent” may be called upon to fill in
                for the actual godparent. For instance, when one of my father's godsons was about to
                get married, he came to our house and asked if my eldest brother could stand in as a
                proxy for my father as he knew that my father had long since passed away. Another
                situation where the “proxy godparent” may be called in is if the actual godparent is
                either off-island or too ill to attend the wedding ceremony.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                While I did not see my father engage in this customary respectful act of ttong while
                I was growing up in the Northern Islands, I am certain that he performed this act
                whenever he met up with his aunts and uncles living in Saipan. As to my mother,
                I did have many chances to observe her engage in this practice when we moved to
                Saipan permanently in 1972 right after my father was killed.</p>

                <p>My Generation									
                One of the earliest teachings instilled in us by my parents to accord respeto was to
                “åmen” or “ttong” whenever we met a relative who was my parents' contemporary
                or older. Failure to accord respeto was not tolerated. This was all well and good if
                one knew who amongst the relatives were due to be accorded this act of respeto.
                However, it gets complicated when you find yourself in a crowd of people feeling
                bashful because you do not really know to whom to accord this respectful act.</p>

                <p>I recall my personal experience with this very dilemma. I was 16 when I left home for
                Chicago to pursue my education. I finally moved back home after attending school
                and living and working in the States for almost 20 years. Unfortunately, my long
                absence from home made attempts to re-assimilate back into my community chal-
                lenging. I often found myself in awkward and embarrassing situations wherein I did
                not know most of the people surrounding me at social gatherings or at other public
                functions, including members of my Refaluwasch community. To play it safe and
                avoid offending anyone, I mistakenly decided to “åmen” or “ttong” the folks who
                had gray hair. I assumed they had to be a generation older than me and, therefore,
                worthy of the respectful gesture. However, that was not a fail-proof method. Much
                to my chagrin, I ended up having gray-haired folks yank their hands away from me
                in exasperation. However, some did laugh at me, but, thankfully, they also took the
                opportunity to educate me and point out that we were contemporaries and so it
                was, therefore, inappropriate for me to engage in the respectful practice of “ttong”
                with them. Nevertheless, some others believe that receiving a blessing—albeit from
                a contemporary—is still a good thing.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                No doubt that unless the practice of ttong is taught and reinforced as the children
                are growing up, this would not be something that the next generation would au-
                tomatically value and appreciate and, therefore, feel compelled to perform as
                appropriate. This generation either ignores this significant cultural component of
                showing respeto to one's elders or their godparents. Of those who do observe this
                practice, I would say that, with few exceptions, a vast majority of them complete the
                act of ttong in a perfunctory manner. For example, my generation would approach
                the relative or godparent, reach for and raise the right hand while bending down to
                kiss it and say “Ñiot” or “Ñiora” and then wait for the relative or godparent to put his
                or her hand on our heads and bless us. Disappointingly, I have observed a number
                of members of the next generation opt to ttong from a distance, if at all. They simply
                approach and bend over from a few feet away and say “Ñiora” without walking up to
                hold the hand and kiss it and wait for the blessing.</p>

                <p>Another dramatic departure from the traditional hand kissing in ttong that I have
                observed in this generation is the quick peck on the cheek while saying “Ñiora.” We
                know that this is a customary greeting in many other countries, including the United
                States. But, while there is nothing wrong with this manner of greeting friends and
                loved ones, the symbolic act of kissing the hand in ttong is done for a completely
                different purpose—to accord respeto and to receive a blessing in return. Today, this
                important cultural act of according respeto and receiving a blessing in return has
                somehow morphed into a mere greeting with a peck on the cheek. Again, I empha-
                size that the two are not interchangeable. They are mutually exclusive—each done
                for a completely different purpose.</p>

                <p>For obvious reasons, I am not a fan of this trend, as it takes away from the signifi-
                cance of what is supposed to be a meaningful mutual exchange of paying respect
                and receiving a blessing in return. A peck on the cheek is simply that—a greet-
                ing—which is different from and does not equate to ttong, which is the giving of
                respect and then receiving a blessing in return. Thinking about this issue opened
                my eyes to how my mother must have felt whenever my siblings and I failed to live
                up to her expectations of how we ought to practice and observe respeto in all its
                various forms and nuances.</p>

                <p>II. Rankings by Gender and Birth Order
                Refaluwasch society is a matrilineal society wherein the eldest woman within each
                clan is entrusted with the powerful position of being the “trustee of the family land.”
                Despite this, the plain fact is that men still outrank women in Refaluwasch society.
                This is just the way it is and has been this way for many, many generations. The man
                is the head of the household. Male children outrank female children. Sisters are
                taught to respect their brothers and to act in a respectful manner toward them, such
                as using respectful language when speaking to them or about them and monitoring
                their behavior to remain respectful at all times. Conversely, the men are expected
                to be mindful of their language and behavior around their sisters to ensure that
                respeto is also observed at all times.</p>

                <p>But this is not the only ranking system that must be followed. Another ranking
                system also exists within each gender. If there are five brothers, for example, the
                eldest brother would outrank the younger brothers and so forth on down the peck-
                ing order. This is the same with sisters. In theory, this is the way things are supposed
                to work. However, within my parents' generation, younger male siblings still accord
                their older female siblings respeto in the same manner that they would accord res-
                peto to older male siblings. This, too, is proper and acceptable. While this may seem
                like a contradiction, I say it is more of an exception rather than a contradiction.</p>

                <p>These rankings apply to other relatives as well. If one were to look at a family tree,
                the children of the eldest male relative would outrank the children born to younger
                siblings and the rankings would extend down the family tree to the very last branch.
                The next in line in terms of this ranking system would be the children of the second
                eldest male and so forth. Finally, after the children of the youngest male would come
                the children of the oldest female. The rankings continue with the children of the
                second oldest female, then down to the children of the youngest female being last.</p>

                <p>These ranking systems can get complicated, and some might even say it is a convo-
                luted system that is impossible to truly grasp. However, serious attempts at learning
                and understanding these systems are important, as one must do everything possi-
                ble to avoid offending anyone and shaming the family. For example, it would be
                highly improper for the children of any younger sibling to ask the children of the
                older male siblings to perform any chores for them. Yet, it is perfectly appropriate
                for the children of the older siblings to ask the children of the younger siblings to
                perform chores for them. This applies to the rest of the families on down the line.
                Hence, knowing such rankings is crucial in “saving face,” as to act improperly or
                disrespectfully would bring shame and dishonor to the family. Obviously, this is to
                be avoided at all costs.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                I recall that my father always remained respectful of his siblings, including his only
                sister who was older than him. Again, this was the exception I mentioned earlier
                about brothers according respeto to their sisters as well, which is perfectly accept-
                able. This same deference also extended to my father's relatives. Also, as I mentioned
                above, my mother was the oldest child in her family, so I saw her younger siblings,
                including my uncle who was the youngest child in my mother's family, accord my
                mother a lot of deference. My mother practiced the Refaluwasch customs of awóówó
                (respectful language) and appwóro (respectful behavior) where my uncle was con-
                cerned, and so both accorded respeto toward one another. My mother also accorded
                respeto to her other male relatives.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                In my family, the ranking system was also observed in terms of recognizing that our
                eldest brother commanded the highest respeto of all. All of us accorded him the
                respeto that he was entitled to by virtue of his birth order, as well as the fact that
                he was also a male. But while our mother and other relatives attempted to teach us
                women to practice the custom of appwóro to accord respeto to all our brothers, with
                few exceptions, my generation was less rigid in applying this practice, if at all. For
                instance, in my immediate family, none of my brothers was ever required to stand
                up in order for us to pass by. However, my brothers would definitely stand up for our
                female cousins who were practicing appwóro. Nevertheless, my sisters and I also
                understood that we should not and would not walk past our brothers or other male
                relatives if they were sitting on the floor without first politely asking them to get
                up off the floor and at least sit in a chair while we walk past them. My other male
                siblings who are younger than our eldest male sibling are also expected to observe
                the same practice when it comes to our eldest brother and so forth down the line.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                In our family, we were met with mediocre results when trying to teach the ranking
                system to our children. The next generation lives in a far different world than my
                generation or my parents' generation lived in.</p>

                <p>III. Kkapasal Faluwasch
                In Refaluwasch culture, there is an everyday language that everyone uses. We call
                this language “kappasal falwasch” (language of our island). While kappasal falu-
                wasch may be used among peers and in communications between older and younger
                generations, depending on the family's respeto practices that rank family members,
                there may be limitations or variations in how widely this everyday language is used.</p>

                <p>For example, some Refaluwasch families are more traditional than others; there-
                fore, they may adhere to a more rigid custom of speaking kappasal faluwasch when
                addressing certain individuals to avoid being disrespectful in their manner of com-
                munication. For instance, kappasal faluwasch may be peppered with the respectful
                language of awóówó where appropriate to accord respeto to whomever the intended
                audience is. Some may also use kappasal faluwasch when they are in the exclusive
                presence of their respective gender's company, where the rigidity and importance of
                choosing one's words carefully is far more relaxed. Yet, another situation in which
                kappasal faluwasch is spoken without peppering it with awóówó is communica-
                tion between spouses.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                Regarding my parents, I know that they communicated with each other in kappasal
                faluwasch. There was no requirement for either of them to speak the language of
                awóówó when communicating with each other.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My generation's first spoken language is also kappasal faluwasch. Both parents
                spoke to us in kappasal faluwasch and we also spoke it amongst each other, as well
                as with friends and relatives.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                Cultural advocates and preservationists say, “You lose your language, you lose your
                culture.” I believe this is true. Perhaps in our zeal to push our children to excel in
                school, where English is the only language taught and spoken in virtually all subjects,
                we began speaking English to our children at home almost to the exclusion of our own
                Refaluwasch language. This was and IS a big mistake. I believe this has shortchanged
                our children's opportunity to learn their first language at home while simultane-
                ously learning English in school. The addition of the television in our homes also
                contributed to the replacement of our Refaluwasch language with English. While it
                is good that our toddlers learn to speak English while watching children's shows on
                televisions, iPads and cell phones, imagine how much better it would have been if our
                children also watched similar programs in our own Native languages.</p>

                <p>Additionally, almost all the books the kids read in school are written in English.
                Consequently, it became more and more of a struggle and almost a losing battle to
                attempt to teach the Refaluwasch language to the next generation, who seemed to
                have less and less interest in learning the language. When you speak in kappasal fa-
                luwasch to members of the next generation, you are more likely to be met with blank
                stares or question marks written on their faces as they are often virtually clueless as
                to what you are saying to them. If you speak to them in kappasal faluwasch, some
                will respond in English with, “I don't understand what you're saying.” When this
                became apparent in our own family decades ago, one of my brothers, who opened
                my eyes as well as the eyes of some of our other siblings, decided that it was time to
                take drastic measures to stem and reverse the tide.</p>

                <p>To do this, we decided that whenever our nieces or nephews would call the house,
                we would say “Refaluwasch” once they began speaking in English. This startled
                them at first. In fact, we endured weeks of their stammering on the phone, followed
                by silence that culminated in the kids hanging up on us in frustration. However, a
                line had been drawn, and, for everyone's sake, especially our children's, it was im-
                portant to stand our ground. My brother even required some of the younger kids in
                our family to begin writing daily journals in Refaluwasch about what happened in
                school. This made for some hilarious reading, but the kids got the point.</p>

                <p>Of course, it did not happen overnight, but eventually, it began to pay off. Today,
                these once-young members of the next generation are fluent in kappasal faluwasch
                and those who have become parents are now able to pass on kappasal faluwasch
                to their own children.</p>

                <p>Although we averted the total loss of kappasal faluwasch in the next generation in
                our immediate family (and perhaps other families might have also met with sim-
                ilar success), unfortunately, there are still some gaps. Ongoing efforts to teach our
                children kappasal faluwasch must continue. We know that some parents of my
                generation still speak English exclusively or almost exclusively to their children
                who were born in the next generation. My hope is that we make every effort to col-
                lectively encourage and remind such parents that their assistance and cooperation
                in this regard are crucial. I am mindful, however, that this effort to preserve our</p>

                <p>indigenous language will succeed only if the parents believe it is something valuable
                and worth preserving.</p>

                <p>With optimism, I can say that not all is lost. I cannot emphasize this enough—we
                MUST bring back our bilingual classes to our schools. At one time, our Public School
                System offered bilingual classes which, in my opinion, proved to be invaluable in pro-
                viding many young children with some kappasal faluwasch lessons that they were
                not exposed to at home. It was far better than nothing. Ideally, kappasal faluwasch
                lessons ought to begin at home and should be reinforced or augmented in school, as
                well as through other community programs that could be offered or sponsored by the
                Carolinian Affairs Office, the Indigenous Office, the Language Policy Commission, or
                some other programs funded both locally and federally. I also understand that there
                were some schools in our Public School System that offered language immersion
                classes as part of their bilingual classes. I applaud this move and believe should be
                revived with the return of our bilingual programs to our schools.</p>

                <p>IV. Awóówó
                There is a respectful language in Refaluwasch culture called “awóówó.” This hon-
                orific language must be used to accord respeto when interacting with certain family
                members, as well as members of the general public. This language is also essential
                in communicating with male relatives, including older relatives who must be ac-
                corded respeto. The same applies to communicating with children. However, it is
                not appropriate to apply the honorific language of awóówó to oneself. For example,
                in the everyday language of kappasal faluwasch, a person may say “Ibwe mwongo”
                (I'm going to eat), but one may not apply the awóówó language when referring to
                oneself by saying “Ibwe ilitiyáy.”</p>

                <p>Moreover, when inviting someone to eat, one might say in kappasal faluwasch “Itto
                mwongo” (Come eat), depending on whom the person is addressing. For instance,
                an older sister may say this to her younger sister or perhaps an older brother may
                say this to a younger brother. However, a Refaluwasch woman may never use such
                language to invite her brother, parents, older relatives, a child, or members of the
                public to eat, as that would be very impolite. So, instead, she must use the respectful
                language of awóówó and say “Itto ilitúgh” (Come eat) if she were addressing a single
                person. If she were inviting individuals from any of the aforementioned categories
                of persons, however, she would say “Aw itto ilitúghámi” (Come eat, everyone). When
                addressing a child, she would say “Itto mamma” (Come eat), and if she were address-
                ing more than one child, she would say “Aw itto mamma” (Come eat, everyone).</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                Generally speaking, whenever my parents communicated with others, they would
                speak in kappasal faluwasch, although awóówó was also spoken whenever the
                situation dictated such. And, while I did not observe my father speak the awóówó
                language, I certainly observed my mother utilizing this language in her everyday
                communications with family members. As explained above, rankings do play an
                important role in how awóówó is used. So, while my mother was required to use
                the language of awóówó at all times in communicating with her brothers, elders,
                relatives, and members of the public, she was not required to use awóówó when
                communicating with her younger sisters because, as the eldest female in her family,
                my mother outranked her two younger sisters. However, my mother's younger sis-
                ters were required to address her in the language of awóówó.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My generation speaks the everyday kappasal faluwasch with some words of awóówó
                when called for. However, I know that the awóówó language is spoken less and
                less frequently. Despite my mother's best efforts to teach us awóówó, it is my firm
                belief that unless the language is spoken regularly in the house, it is easy to lose
                it—assuming one acquired it to begin with. This is why I see fewer and fewer people
                speaking awóówó today. In other words, there needs to be a constant teaching and
                reinforcement of this awóówó language for it to remain relevant and to prevent it
                from fading into obscurity. If we do not use it, we lose it. It is as simple as that.</p>

                <p>I know that there is great admiration for those who still speak awóówó today. This
                is especially true of children. Children who speak awóówó today garner high praise
                and much respect and admiration for themselves as well as their families. There is
                this belief that a child who speaks awóówó is a child who has been brought up right.
                Though admirable for the respeto values it promotes, one of the reasons awóówó
                is losing its popularity with each generation is that it is a difficult language to un-
                derstand and master. English has become a necessary language of education and
                modern-day survival. It is the world's common language used to connect peoples</p>

                <p>of all walks of life from practically every nation on Earth. Thus, unlike my parents'
                generation and previous generations, there is more emphasis on teaching and learn-
                ing English as opposed to teaching and learning awóówó.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                For those members of the next generation who are proficient in awóówó, I commend
                them and their parents or relatives who imparted such knowledge to them. They
                are rare gems. This shows that there are some members of the next generation who
                value our culture enough to invest in learning about our culture and languages.
                They made sure they spent quality time with their elders who effectively imparted
                such knowledge to them. They are the stewards who keep the cultural links connect-
                ed. This is a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

                <p>One such steward I have met and interviewed is an impressive young man in
                his mid-20s who is able to write and speak eloquently in both Chamorro and
                Refaluwasch. He epitomizes the bright hope for the future and is a credit to the next
                generation. After I spoke with him, this young gentleman revealed to me that his
                desire to preserve his Refaluwasch and Chamorro heritage was inspired by Lieweila:
                A Micronesian Story, the historical cultural documentary film that I co-produced
                and released in 1998 with Dr. Beret E. Strong, her husband John Tweedy, Esq.,
                and my brother, Gus. The film traces the emigration of my Refaluwasch ancestors
                from the central Carolines to the Marianas in the 1800s. Led by Chief Aghurubw
                and two other chiefs, the Marianas is where they resettled after they were forced to
                escape from earthquakes, floods and devastating typhoons. The film also traces my
                Refaluwasch ancestors' shared history with my Chamorro ancestors under various
                colonial regimes that ruled the Marianas, starting with the Spanish, followed by the
                Germans, the Japanese and then the Americans.</p>

                <p>This particular young man had an impressive appreciation and knowledge of both
                his Chamorro and Refaluwasch cultures and languages. He speaks and writes in
                both languages fluently, which has garnered even more respect and admiration from
                me. I conducted my interview with him via social media and immediately regretted
                not having met him in person before he returned to the States to care for his elderly
                grandparents. I would say that this young man represented the exception rather
                than the rule. He especially impressed me with his command and use of awóówó as
                we conversed, as well as his understanding of respeto and the importance of using
                appropriate language in public debates, such as on social media.</p>

                <p>The young man caught my attention when I first read his comments on social media
                reminding another individual of the importance of minding our language in public
                debates. He spoke of how disappointed our elders would have been had they heard
                the coarse language being used in public debates today. When I asked him about
                this, he lamented that someone told him a long time ago that if he truly wanted to
                learn about his culture, then he would have to go and live with the elders who could
                teach him what he needed to learn. And that is exactly what he did. That he was
                able to confidently use his knowledge and maturity to remind or teach others how
                to communicate properly in public is a testament to the fine job that his elders had
                done in imparting valuable life lessons to him. This is truly commendable on the
                part of the student and his teachers.</p>

                <p>Within my own family, the members of the next generation are communicating in
                kappasal faluwasch mixed with some English, though we continue to encourage
                them to use kappasal falwasch as the main language at home. Unfortunately,
                their knowledge and use of awóówó is still somewhat limited, but some are
                making some progress.</p>

                <p>V. Off-color Jokes and Cuss Words
                In Refaluwasch culture, there is a divide between proper male and female behav-
                iors that dictates what each gender ought to say and how each should behave. This
                is done to accord mutual respeto to one another and to avoid committing cultur-
                al taboos. For example, men and women must never tell off-color jokes in mixed
                company. Men and women may use provocative language to tell jokes, but such lan-
                guage must be restricted to the privacy of same-gender gatherings. To do otherwise
                is taboo. The rationale behind this is that violating this taboo will erode respeto.
                For brothers and sisters, maintaining respeto is especially important and something
                that must be safeguarded at all times.</p>

                <p>Refaluwasch people also believe that respeto demands that one never use cuss
                words with one's parents, brothers, elder sisters, or young children. Of course, it is
                considered in poor taste and taboo to cuss in public. Not only would cussing be</p>

                <p>a breach of respeto, but it is also believed that sisters should never cuss out their
                brothers as this could result in dire consequences for the brothers. Why? This is
                because Refaluwasch people believe that a woman's words are very strong and pow-
                erful and, therefore, directing cuss words at one's brother could potentially bring
                some illness upon him. It is tantamount to casting a curse upon one's brother. In
                some instances, it is believed that this may even lead to sickness and death.</p>

                <p>Additionally, such risqué language and jokes must also be avoided in the presence of
                elders and children. There is a reason that gender segregation exists in Refaluwasch
                society when people are socializing. This is done to avoid the risk of offending
                anyone with “loose” language in a more relaxed atmosphere, especially in situations
                where alcohol is involved and there is typically a lot of teasing and joking around,
                sometimes using cuss words and delving into subject matters that are best not dis-
                cussed in mixed company. Hence, both genders accept that there are certain cultural
                practices both genders must observe in order to preserve respeto. Thus, gender seg-
                regation is one way of upholding and ensuring respeto.</p>

                <p>Moreover, Refaluwasch people believe that there is a strong correlation between
                what one might say and how one might act. Thus, if the genders communicate in a
                respectful language to each other, then a corresponding respectful behavior towards
                one another follows. Conversely, if the males or females do not accord each other
                proper respectful language, then the erosion or lack of respeto amongst the two may
                inevitably lead to risqué behavior, which is forbidden in Refaluwasch society. This
                is a fine line that must never ever be crossed. To do so brings with it “loss of face” and
                shame to the families on both sides.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                For obvious reasons, my parents would not or did not engage in any of these types of
                joking and teasing, much less cussing. Otherwise, such behaviors would have regis-
                tered in my or my siblings' conscious memories. The fact that my memory is devoid
                of any personal anecdotes where one or both of my parents either engaged in hurl-
                ing cuss words at each other or at others or telling risqué jokes in mixed company or
                in public arenas assures me that they both acted properly and responsibly. This says
                a lot given that both of my parents were known for their great sense of humor and
                quick wit. My father was also quite a prankster, though all in good, clean fun. My
                mother was also quick with a smile. She liked to laugh, tease and joke as well. But as
                I said, throughout the years, I never saw either parent act inappropriately.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My generation is also expected to operate within the same cultural constraints that
                prohibit the telling of off-color jokes or using cuss words in much the same way
                as my parents' generation or previous generations. However, there were some in-
                stances I was privy to where I would say that there were lapses in good judgment.
                For example, I once observed a fellow Refaluwasch woman going along with and
                engaging in sharing off-color jokes with our male Chamorro colleagues at a social
                gathering in order to fit in. This made me uncomfortable as a Refaluwasch woman,
                but it was not my place to say anything to her. In this regard, my Refaluwasch culture
                clashed with my Chamorro culture in a major way.</p>

                <p>In my Chamorro culture, sharing off-color jokes in mixed company is perfectly fine.
                In fact, the more you engage in it, the more you are accepted into the circle. However,
                this is the antithesis of how to fit in in my Refaluwasch culture. It is one of the big
                taboos that my Refaluwasch culture preaches directly against. I have also personally
                experienced this culture clash.</p>

                <p>Several years ago, while briefly working for the same employer as one of my
                brothers, we ended up finding ourselves in the most awkward and embarrassing
                situations whenever our Chamorro co-workers would tell off-color jokes with the
                two of us present in the same room. Obviously, we could not stop our Chamorro
                colleagues from telling such jokes, which they considered to be harmless and all
                in good fun. But, in order to minimize such awkward situations and adhere to our
                own Refaluwasch cultural values, my brother and I made a point of taking turns
                leaving the room periodically whenever we were in social gatherings. This way,
                our colleagues continued to enjoy themselves without my brother and me being
                embarrassed. Perhaps this solution may seem drastic, but to us, it was a necessary
                compromise that worked for us.</p>

                <p>On another matter, I have also come across a number of folks in my generation who
                sometimes post on social media to blast an anonymous person they were angry at
                using strong cuss words that were disturbing and embarrassing. Not only is this in</p>

                <p>poor taste, but it often reflected poorly on the very person or persons launching
                the attacks. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, have shrunk the world by
                connecting everyone from near and far in this virtual world. However, when used
                improperly, social media can give some a false sense of courage. It emboldens some
                to spew hate and disrespectful language online, which the individuals might think
                twice about doing in person. When used properly, social media can be a great tool for
                the education of others and staying connected with friends and loved ones. However,
                when used carelessly, it can become a formidable weapon of cultural destruction. It
                goes without saying that the key here is to use social media responsibly.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                As much as we do our best to teach our children about awóówó and other respect-
                ful manners, unfortunately, like adults, they also sometimes exhibit lapses in good
                judgement and engage in inappropriate joking. For example, I believe that the
                popularity of explicit or vulgar rap music has had a negative impact on younger
                generations. Music is one way in which children acquire language and without the
                expletives in popular music, our children would probably not have this type of lan-
                guage or speech in their daily vocabularies. Western comedians are also partly to
                blame. Comedy using foul language attracts younger generations who get caught up
                in the humor of the jokes, regardless of the way they may run counter to the values
                within their own culture.</p>

                <p>Again, I reiterate that social media plays a role in the erosion of respeto by
                providing an easy and convenient vehicle with a built-in audience in which one
                can log-in and spew hatred and foul language in the relative comfort of one's
                home with almost total impunity. This not something that the impressionable next
                generation ought to emulate.</p>

                <p>VI. Addressing Elders and Children
                In our Refaluwasch culture, elders and children are to be addressed using respectful
                language at all times. However, there is a slight variation in the respectful language
                that is used to communicate with elders versus that which is used to communicate
                with children. For example, the word “mamma” (eat) is often used when commu-
                nicating with children. As stated earlier, to invite an adult to eat, one ought to use
                the polite word “ilitúgh” (eat) or “yááyá” (partake). However, over time, the same
                word used to invite children to eat—“mamma”—has gained acceptance while
                communicating with elders or visitors in general. Again, generally speaking, the
                use of the word “mwongo” (eat) when addressing everyone else but oneself is con-
                sidered very impolite.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                While I did not observe my father use the language of awóówó while I was growing
                up, my mother certainly utilized the awóówó language extensively whenever she
                communicated with elders or children.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My generation still uses awóówó to communicate with elders and children, so the
                practice continues. However, there may be some irregularities depending on the
                household one is brought up in. In other words, if the parents or a parent teaches
                awóówó to their children as they are growing up, then they would most likely use
                this tool. Otherwise, if the children were never exposed to awóówó, then they would
                not use it. With regard to my own immediate family, my mother did her part to instill
                awóówó lessons in us with varying degrees of success. I can state unequivocally that I
                know a lot more and also a lot less about speaking awóówó than some of my siblings.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                With some exceptions, the next generation is generally lacking in the knowledge of
                awóówó, which leads me to my earlier point expressing that many parents do not
                teach this respectful language in the home as often as previous generations have.
                However, teaching awóówó to the next generation is not as simple as one might think
                given that English has become the preferred language within many of Refaluwasch
                homes today. I attribute this to the home environment having changed drastically in
                numerous ways for many members of the next generation.</p>

                <p>For one thing, having both parents working to earn a living outside the house meant
                that the next generation is being raised by foreign houseworkers who speak English,
                not Refaluwasch, to the children. Another reason is that, in our zeal to propel our-
                selves forward in keeping pace with modern society, we have imported beliefs from
                other cultures without considering what consequences this might have on our re-
                spective cultures in our communities. For instance, we thought it was a good idea</p>

                <p>to build a Manåmku' (Senior Citizens) Center to provide a place where our elders
                could gather socially. However, the unintended disadvantage was that this took the
                elders out of their family homes and resulted in lost opportunities for them to in-
                teract with younger generations on a daily basis. Thus, a number of children were
                deprived of prime opportunities to learn awóówó and other valuable lessons of our
                Refaluwasch culture from their elders.</p>

                <p>Another challenge is that there are more mixed marriages between Refaluwasch
                and persons from other countries, including the United States. Obviously, English
                is the primary language used to communicate in our diverse society, and, unless
                efforts are made by either parent to teach the children their respective languages,
                English will be the only language spoken by the children. In such situations, even
                the most fluent speaker of awóówó would be hard-pressed to force awóówó lessons
                on the English-speaking children who may not have the slightest inclination to
                learn the language. As the popular saying goes, “You can lead a horse to water, but
                you can't make it drink.”</p>

                <p>VII. “Bostus” or “Tarapaas” Language or Behavior
                In situations where someone callously spews disrespectful language or acts in an
                indecent manner without regard to audience or venue, this behavior is often met
                with heavy criticism and scorn as this definitely goes against everything that one is
                taught about practicing respeto. I have heard this manner of speaking being referred
                to as “bostus” (rough) or “tarapaas” (scattered). For example, in a public setting, if
                one were to invite everyone to eat, one should never use the everyday language of
                kappasal falwasch and say “Aw itto mwongo” (Come eat, everyone) for that would
                be frowned upon and the speaker would be denounced as being very disrespect-
                ful for using bostus or tarapaas language. Whether in gatherings at home or in a
                public arena, but most especially when in a public setting, the speaker must always
                accord respeto by addressing the people using the respectful language of awóówó.
                The host or hostess may say something like “Sa yááya milikka pattiisch” (Let's all
                partake in our feast).</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                In all my years with my parents, not once did I ever see them act in this bostus or
                tarapaas manner that would have brought shame to the family. As a matter of fact,
                this is precisely the type of unacceptable behavior that my mother would have been
                horrified to see any family member engage in.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                My parents endeavored to teach and mold us into model citizens and to behave in
                a manner that would not dishonor our family. Family pride was very important to
                them and they instilled this value in all of us. Therefore, they would be aghast if we
                were to engage in speech or behavior that would be considered bostus or tarapaas.</p>

                <p>However, like other generations, my generation is also vulnerable to the influences
                of alcohol. We know that alcohol can have negative influences on people's behav-
                iors regardless if they are at home or out in public. Therefore, some people—male
                or female—under the influence of alcohol may be susceptible to engaging in such
                bostus or tarapaas speech or behavior that they normally would not engage in
                when sober. It goes without saying that we must be mindful at all times that we
                must all endeavor to use alcohol responsibly, whether in social settings or while
                driving on our highways.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                I believe that one's family and upbringing play a major role in how one is expected to
                behave in public or in family social gatherings. The next generation must be guided
                and encouraged to walk the straight and narrow path. Not surprisingly, the absence
                of proper guidance or positive role models in a child's life may manifest itself in
                socially unacceptable language and behavior that are labeled bostus or tarapaas.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, alcohol is not the only threat to the success of the next generation.
                While teenage drinking is something that is common amongst the members of the
                next generation, another threat that preys on such young lives is drugs. Peer pressure
                is the devil in disguise. As a former prosecutor, I was privy to sad situations in which
                I saw members of the next generation throw their lives and future away by getting
                involved in alcohol, drugs and petty crime because they lacked a stable home en-
                vironment and a family support system to nurture and guide them. Unfortunately,
                unless these basic needs are met, such troubled members of the next generation will
                be prone to engage in tarapaas behaviors and bostus speech.</p>

                <p>VIII. Appwóro (To Respectfully Bow Down)
                Just as there is a respectful language called awóówó, another way to accord respeto
                is in how both genders conform their behaviors toward one another. Refaluwasch
                call this “appwóro” (to respectfully bow down). For example, it is a cultural taboo
                for a sister to walk upright and past her brother upon entering a room while he
                is sitting down. For the sister to properly and respectfully proceed, she would first
                humbly ask her brother to stand up before she enters the room. Of course, if her
                brother were alert and saw his sister approaching, he would have taken his cue to
                stand up before she arrived to accord his sister proper respeto in return. Standing
                to accord a lady respeto upon her entering a room is analogous to the chivalrous
                act of a Western gentleman who stands up when a woman enters a room. We see
                this depicted in Western movies or television shows often. With that said, the same
                appwóro requirements do not apply to the sister's children with regard to their uncle
                (the mother's brother).</p>

                <p>Under certain circumstances, when it is impossible for a brother stand up, such as
                when a brother in bed due to an illness, his sister is expected to approach him or go
                past him on her knees or, in some instances, crawl past him on all fours until she is
                some distance away before resuming her upright standing position. In other cases,
                however, the sister would refrain altogether from entering the room upon seeing
                her brother lying on the floor. Moreover, consideration is also accorded to persons
                with disabilities who need to be accommodated with chairs or a raised seat. Again,
                a person who adheres to the proper requirements of appwóro not only garners im-
                mediate respeto for himself or herself, but also extend respeto to the person's family.</p>

                <p>Appwóro is also practiced in public settings. For example, during wakes, family
                members (such as elder women and children) usually gather on mats on the floor
                and sit around the coffin. It is customary that a woman, whether young or old, who
                enters a room must never simply enter assuming a regular upright posture, but
                must show respeto by bowing upon entering the room, by walking on her knees,
                or by crawling to join family members sitting around the coffin. Failure to accord
                respeto this way should be avoided, since such behavior is frowned upon. I cannot
                emphasize this point enough—behaving in a disrespectful manner not only casts
                aspersions on the character of the “offender,” but also reflects poorly on the of-
                fender's family. This is because people will assume that the family was negligent
                in teaching proper manners of respeto to the “offender.” Otherwise, the “offender”
                would have known better.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                Perhaps it is because I lost my father when I was only 10 years old and was, there-
                fore, deprived of the joy of a life lived with him that I have no specific knowledge
                or recollection of him ever practicing appwóro. My mother, on the other hand,
                most definitely practiced appwóro throughout her life. She not only practiced ap-
                pwóro with her youngest brother, but also with the male and female relatives who
                were her contemporaries.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                As stated earlier, appwóro was something taught and encouraged by my mother as
                we grew up. However, my generation's version of appwóro is not as strict or rigid
                as the version practiced by my mother and women of her generation. The reason
                for this is that many women of my generation have not found the more rigid and
                traditional form of appwóro practical for our lives today.</p>

                <p>When I asked one of my relatives whether she practiced appwóro, she responded
                immediately with a hearty chuckle. After regaining her composure, she told me that,
                on the contrary, she would deliberately go out of her way to avoid practicing appwóro
                because she would not conform to behaviors of bending, kneeling and crawling just
                to get past her brothers or other males who were entitled to be accorded such acts
                of respeto. In fact, she said she specifically avoided practicing appwóro by steering
                clear of the vicinities where she knew the men gathered.</p>

                <p>In today's modern world, many Refaluwasch women have entered the workforce in
                greater numbers than before. The reason for this is not just a matter of choice. It is
                a matter of necessity in most cases, as many families find it virtually impossible to
                survive on a single income. Also, some women now hold key leadership positions
                in government, as well as in the private sector. Speaking from personal experience,
                I know that I, and others like me, found that practicing appwóro in its rigid form is
                impractical in today's diverse heterogeneous society.</p>

                <p>For example, when I worked as an Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
                Division of the Office of the Attorney General in the CNMI, my job as a prosecutor
                necessitated that I stand up in the courtroom while addressing the jurors or the
                court. A number of my male relatives work in law enforcement. Therefore, it was not
                unusual for me to interact with male relatives while working on a particular case.
                Some male relatives who are not in law enforcement have also appeared in court
                when summoned for jury duty. Had I been practicing appwóro, I would have had
                to ask all male relatives present in the courtroom who are my contemporaries to
                stand and remain standing before I could stand to perform my job in the courtroom.
                Culturally speaking, they would not have been allowed to sit down until I sat down.
                Obviously, that would have been impractical, not to mention awkward.</p>

                <p>This would have been true in other public settings as well. For instance, there
                were numerous occasions when I was called upon to stand and speak publicly as
                a member of the Legislature or during political events. I did not find it practical
                to stand on a stage or at the podium and assume the appwóro posture, even if my
                brothers were in the audience. Yet, according them and the members of the public,
                respeto in the way that I addressed them through language was always expected.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, I acknowledge that other Refaluwasch women may choose a differ-
                ent path. The Refaluwasch woman has the ultimate choice—regardless of where
                she is doing her public speaking—to choose to either stand on stage like I did or
                stand offstage at the same level as the audience if that is her preference. This is
                also acceptable and keeps with Refaluwasch values of humility and never putting
                oneself above others.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                I am certain that some parents do teach members of the next generation in their
                families some important socially polite behaviors, but from my observations, the
                strict mandates of appwóro are mostly ignored. Again, this is something that our
                Refaluwasch society must examine and determine whether these rules are worth
                preserving, and, if the answer is “yes,” then meaningful steps should be taken to bring
                about the desired results. Otherwise, not teaching it is analogous to discarding it.</p>

                <p>IX. Sharing Cups, Dishes and Utensils
                Traditional Refaluwasch culture also has strict etiquette governing the sharing of
                cups, dishes and utensils between brothers and sisters. It is considered a cultural
                taboo for sisters to share cups, dishes, or utensils with their brothers. If a brother
                visits a sister's house, he is prohibited from using any cup except for the cup that has
                been specifically designated as “his.” The brother is also restricted from using any sil-
                verware or plate aside from those designated as “his.” If he uses a cup, dish or utensil
                that is not specifically designated as “his,” his sister is forbidden from using that same
                cup, dish or utensil. Regardless of whether it was an unintentional use by the brother,
                the sister would still not be allowed to use the item(s) for a few days before such
                item(s) is/are considered “cleansed.” Only then may his sister use the item(s) again.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                My father did not observe this cultural practice. However, my mother most certainly
                observed this cultural practice as applied to her brother, as well as her contempo-
                rary male relatives. Such restrictions only governed the relationship between the
                sister and her brother. No such restrictions applied to the children.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                With some exceptions, I would say that my generation made a complete departure
                from our parents' generation when it came to sharing utensils, cups and dishes.
                This was a cultural practice that my siblings and I never followed. All of us drank
                from the same cups, ate from the same dishes, and used the same utensils. For some
                reason, my mother decided not to enforce this practice that she and women of her
                generation practiced. Besides, disposable cups, dishes and flatware made this a
                non-issue for most of us.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                As happened in my generation, the cultural restrictions prohibiting the sharing of
                cups, dishes and utensils among male and female siblings also disappeared among
                the next generation.</p>

                <p>X. Using the Outhouse or Bathroom
                In traditional Refaluwasch culture, sisters must navigate their way to the outhouse
                without their brothers knowing or seeing them. Imagine the difficulty of pulling this</p>

                <p>off successfully every time her brother happens to be near the outhouse. In such
                cases, the sister must be resourceful in enlisting the help of others to distract her
                brother and lure him away from the vicinity of the outhouse in order for her dash
                toward it. However, no such restrictions apply to the men.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                To my knowledge, my father never engaged in this practice. Of course, my mother,
                the more traditional of the two, complied with such cultural practices as she was
                raised to understand observing these customs is important. I do recall some instanc-
                es when she was forced to enlist the help of other family members to redirect our
                uncle away from the outhouse in order for her to use it without his knowledge. This
                later ceased being an issue after we moved to a house with an indoor bathroom and
                my uncle moved in with his other sister and her family.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                This is another area of my generation's marked departure from the rigid cultural
                mandates practiced by my mother and members of her generation. While we do
                not go out of our way to advertise when Mother Nature calls, we certainly are not
                required to hide it anymore or to enlist the help of others to distract our brothers as
                we scurry off to “powder our noses” (to use a Western euphemism). Nevertheless,
                common decency and respeto demand that discretion be exercised.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the main reason for this departure from tradition is the current prevalence
                of indoor toilets instead of outhouses. With few exceptions, most contemporary
                Refaluwasch households have one or two indoor bathrooms. Therefore, everyone
                takes turns using the bathroom. In large families, one never knows who is going to
                answer when someone knocks on the bathroom door. Had my sisters and I practiced
                the outhouse etiquette of my mother's generation, this would have presented quite a
                dilemma, perhaps forcing me or one of my sisters to disguise our voices while in the
                bathroom to avoid giving ourselves away if a male sibling came knocking on the bath-
                room door. Once again, I believe that practicality won out over cultural restrictions.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation							
                As with my generation, the taboos that existed in my parents' generation with
                regard to the use of the outhouse or bathroom facilities have disappeared in
                the next generation.</p>

                <p>XI. Socializing
                In traditional Refaluwasch culture, women and men never intermingle when they
                socialize. Men often gather in a group or groups outside the house and away from
                where the women typically gather, which is usually inside the house. This is done
                for the purpose of ensuring that respeto is always maintained during such social
                gatherings. Hence, loose language, dirty jokes, etc. may be shared in a relaxed
                manner without fear of offending the opposite sex or eroding respeto.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                In my early years, growing up on the island of Pagan in the Northern Islands,
                I observed that my father socialized both in an all-male setting as well as in a
                mixed-gender setting. At that time, my father was the elected Congressman repre-
                senting the people of the Northern Islands and was also the District Administrator's
                Representative (DistAd Rep). His position called for him to socialize within a wide
                circle of people from the Northern Marianas, Guam, other islands of Micronesia,
                Hawai‘i, and other US states, as well as other foreign countries, such as Japan and
                Australia. My mother, on the other hand, was more comfortable socializing in an
                environment segregated by gender. Nevertheless, she had to adjust her comfort level
                and adapt to the wider social settings when called upon to host gatherings required
                of my father's position as a public official.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                Today, my family socializes in both gender-segregated and mixed-gender gatherings.
                If there was a gathering that included other relatives, the men would segregate
                themselves from the women as they typically do. As my youngest sister recalled,
                one teaching from my mother regarding respeto while socializing in segregated
                gatherings is that it would be inappropriate for my sister to join the men, even if
                her husband were part of the group. In gatherings of immediate family members,
                however, my family usually socializes in a mixed-gender setting. Our family loves
                to gather and sing, so all of my siblings frequently sit together to socialize and
                sing with our nieces and nephews. No matter what, we must always be mindful of</p>

                <p>treating each other with dignity and respect, in manner as well as in speech. This is
                absolutely non-negotiable.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                I would say that, depending on the situation and the setting, the intermixing or seg-
                regation of the two genders of the next generation is similar to that of my generation.</p>

                <p>XII. Entering the Brother's or Sister's Bedroom
                In traditional Refaluwasch culture, it is generally taboo for a sister to enter her
                brother's bedroom, especially if he is married. However, some exceptions apply. For
                example, the sister may enter the single brother's bedroom if she were to retrieve
                his dirty laundry or clean his room. Otherwise, the sister is expected to stay out of
                the bedroom. Moreover, the sister is prohibited from sitting on or lying down on her
                brother's bed. Doing so would be disrespectful to her brother. In cases where the
                brother is married, it would be his wife's responsibility to retrieve something from the
                bedroom instead of his sister's. This would include the dirty laundry, as the wife takes
                over the laundry duties for herself and her spouse.</p>

                <p>Conversely, the brother is also culturally prohibited from entering his sister's
                bedroom. This is strictly taboo, although this taboo might be relaxed in certain emer-
                gency situations, such as in the event of a fire or a medical emergency. Other than
                according respeto, there is also the expectation that barring the brother's entrance
                into the sister's bedroom acts as a preventive measure against the possibility of inap-
                propriate incestuous behaviors. Hence, one must be vigilant against this at all times.
                Generally speaking, this taboo also includes other male relatives.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                This was less of an issue for my parents as we lived apart from their siblings.
                However, much later, when we moved to Saipan after my father's death, there came
                a time when my uncle (my mother's brother) came to live with us, but he lived in his
                own small shack that was detached from our house. Hence, there was no need for
                him to enter the main house unless he was invited in, much less enter my mother's
                bedroom. My mother certainly had no intentions of entering his little shack.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                In my immediate family, certain reasons provide the “justification” for entering a
                brother's bedroom, such as, if the only phone in the house is located in one brother's
                bedroom. Entering the bedroom to answer the phone is a must. Another “justifiable”
                reason is entering the bedroom to use the desktop computer or printer. Another
                reason would be to retrieve something. Beyond these reasons, the brother's room is
                still considered off-limits out of respect for him and as a preventive measure against
                any inappropriate and unwanted incestuous incidents.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                With the next generation members in my immediate family, respeto is observed in
                that siblings—males and females—are taught to respect the bedrooms of married
                siblings. They are taught that they should not enter such domains unless consent
                is expressly given. For instance, the bedroom occupied by one of my nephews and
                his spouse is also shared with other family members who often stay over on the
                weekends. Hence, the rules are more relaxed. Otherwise, on any normal weeknight,
                respeto must be accorded to give the couple their privacy. Another exception where
                entering the married couple's bedroom is acceptable is when the parents of an
                infant are both away at work while their baby is still asleep in the bedroom. In this
                scenario, it is perfectly fine to enter the bedroom to care for the baby.</p>

                <p>XIII. Attire
                In traditional Refaluwasch culture, men wear a red loin cloth called a “ttughum-
                agh.” Typically, no shirts are worn with the ttughumagh. The traditional women's
                outfit consists of a red wrap-around skirt with hem lines that extend either down
                to the calves or the ankles. The skirt is called an “apelipel.” The women, especially
                older women, also are topless. The skirt alone is considered an entire outfit.</p>

                <p>Subsequent generations later ditched the ttughumaghs and the apelipels as every-
                day wear. This is especially true for Refaluwasch who have moved to Saipan from
                the Northern Islands and find themselves living with other diverse cultures and pop-
                ulations who primarily wear modern Western-style clothes. Obviously, dressing in
                traditional clothing while everyone else is dressed in Western-style clothing makes
                one stand out and would not facilitate successful assimilation into the community.</p>

                <p>It would be awkward for both the Refaluwasch woman or man to appear at work
                topless in their traditional ttughumagh or an apelipel.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                As a young child growing up in Agrigan, I recall seeing the elder men of my parents'
                generation (and even older) wearing the ttughumagh as they went about their daily
                lives. They were often topless. I also recall seeing the women on Agrigan, especially
                the elder women, wearing the apelipel on a daily basis. They, too, went topless.</p>

                <p>However, I never saw my father wearing a ttughumagh until decades later, when I
                visited the American Memorial Park Museum in Saipan one day and came across a
                series of black and white photographs taken on Agrigan immediately after WWII.
                Two of the photographs that are included in the series show one of my aunts (my
                mother's first cousin, who was married to one of my father's elder brothers) holding
                a radio as she stood next to an American GI. In two of the photographs, there were
                two teenage boys kneeling in front while looking back at my aunt and the GI. My
                father was one of the boys in the photographs. He was 14 years old when the photo-
                graphs were taken. Incidentally, one of the photographs taken that day with just my
                aunt and the GI became part of the photo exhibits that hung on the wall for a time
                at the American Memorial Park's WWII Museum. I have never once seen my father
                wearing a ttughumagh in person.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, I did see my mother wearing the apelipel in Agrigan. I even
                recall her telling us a story about when she wore an apelipel to church with one of
                her cousins when they were teenagers. However, she only dressed in contemporary
                Western dresses when we lived in Pagan and Saipan.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                One of the major differences in the manner of dressing between my parents' genera-
                tion and my generation is that the males no longer wear the ttughumagh and women
                no longer wear the apelipel on a daily basis. The only time that these traditional out-
                fits are worn is when either gender is part of a traditional dance group that performs
                to entertain tourists or at some other special cultural events. Other occasions calling
                for the wearing of the ttughumagh or apelipel would be during performances at
                our yearly Cultural Heritage Month celebrations or as part of the entertainment at
                annual events, such as the Flame Tree Arts Festival or Taste of the Marianas.</p>

                <p>Other changes include some folks wearing the ttughumagh as if it were a wrap-
                around skirt instead of as a loincloth style that exposes the buttocks. The women
                still wear the traditional apelipel, although instead of the wrap-around style, some
                find it more practical to have a seamstress sew the apelipel so that it is more fitted,
                and any risk of it coming loose and falling off the hips is eliminated. Otherwise,
                the horizontal-striped wrap-around apelipel also worn by previous generations
                even older than my parents' generation is the other preferred style also used today.
                Another marked change is that the female dancers of today never go topless.</p>

                <p>My eldest sister recalled the story of how my father had to convince my mother
                to allow my sister to wear pants (As I write this, I marvel at how far we have truly
                come). When my eldest sister was in high school in the early 1970s, my father had to
                explain to my mother that my sister needed to climb some stairs to get to her classes
                on the second floor of Marianas High School. Therefore, it was necessary for her to
                wear pants to preserve her modesty and dignity.</p>

                <p>As the second oldest of five girls, I consider myself fortunate that I did not have to
                fight that battle, as my mother had been won over on the practicality of wearing
                pants. However, she remained stubborn about hemlines. While she accepted the tra-
                ditional mandates on where appropriate hemlines should be as she was growing up,
                this was a topic that she was adamant about. She made sure that all of her daughters
                knew her opinion on the matter. Her rule was that the hemline had to be below the
                knee and shorts were off-limits, unless the pant legs were also cut below the knee.</p>

                <p>My eldest sister bore the brunt of our mother's rigid teachings on the subject of
                hemlines. As my sister explained, it was the belief that any outfit worn with the hem-
                line above the knee invited unwanted temptation from the opposite sex. Therefore,
                due care must be taken to avoid putting oneself in such a vulnerable situation. The
                main goal is to avoid putting the idea into the minds of those who may be tempted to
                engage in inappropriate behaviors. As the saying goes—“Better to be safe than sorry.”</p>

                <p>When my eldest sister asked for an explanation of the rationale behind this custom
                of keeping hemlines below the knees, my mother's reply was that this was strictly
                necessary as a “deterrent”—a “preventive measure”—aimed at discouraging the
                male eye from seeing the woman's exposed knees and being tempted to engage in
                lewd thoughts that might then lead to an unwanted sexual attack. However, given
                that Refaluwasch women of my mother's generation and previous generations often
                exposed their breasts fully as they went about their daily chores without any fear
                of triggering inappropriate sexual temptations, it strikes me as an odd contradic-
                tion that a woman's exposed knees would be considered more provocative than
                her exposed breasts.</p>

                <p>Today, I would say that the generational conflict about where the proper hemline
                ought to be has diminished with the popularity of wearing long pants or long
                Western-style skirts. However, the conflict continues regarding wearing “hot pants”
                or “short-shorts.” This is still frowned upon within our immediate family, as well as
                within Refaluwasch society as a whole.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                I have noticed that the rules have relaxed quite a bit with regard to how the next
                generation dresses today. While dressing provocatively is still frowned upon, mem-
                bers of the next generation have been able to get away with far more and treated
                with way more leniency than previous generations, including my own. The hem-
                lines are shorter now, resting above the knee and half-way up the thigh in some
                instances. So, too, have the hemlines for short pants, which have become shorter
                as well. There is even the sharing of clothing, such as t-shirts or socks, amongst the
                two genders that appears to have gained casual acceptance. Broadly speaking, the
                Refaluwasch community has become more tolerant and less traditional, mirroring
                today's more tolerant society.</p>

                <p>One of the signs of the changing times in which we and the next generation now
                live is the acceptance of transgender dress that would have raised eyebrows not
                long ago. Today, some Refaluwasch boys now pierce one or both of their ears,
                pluck their eyebrows, wear make-up, and paint their nails without raising concern.
                But, to cultural purists or traditionalists, this behavior clashes with traditional
                Refaluwasch culture wherein clothes are meant to conform closely to each respec-
                tive gender's masculine or feminine identity without any blurring of lines.</p>

                <p>XIV. Body Parts
                Traditional Refaluwasch culture teaches women that sisters accord their brothers
                respeto by not touching anywhere on their brothers' body from their upper torso
                up to their hair. Unless a brother is sick and in need of being nursed back to health,
                touching the brother's upper torso, face or head is taboo. Another exception to this
                taboo is when the brother is a young child in need of care, such as being bathed or
                being nursed back to health.</p>

                <p>One of the most important things for others to be aware of about Refaluwasch cul-
                ture is that the face is very sacred to the Refaluwasch people. One must never touch
                another person's face—adults or children—and, if one must do so, then one must
                preface such action by saying “Tirow.” While most people typically hear the word
                “Tirow” used as a greeting (Hello), used in this context, however, the word means
                “Excuse me” or “Pardon me.”</p>

                <p>This Refaluwasch cultural belief that the face must never be touched clashes with
                other cultures that believe it is perfectly okay to pinch a baby's cheeks to convey
                one's affection or opinion of the baby's cuteness, or even those who pinch an adult's
                cheeks in a playful manner. What one culture may deem to be an appropriate act
                to convey affection is something that Refaluwasch people regard as rude. This is
                especially true in cases where the pinches result in the baby's screaming in pain.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                In both his medical profession and role as a local healer, my father was accorded the
                privilege of touching the face and other body parts in order to treat his patients. For
                instance, I saw my father touch a patient's face as he pulled an abscessed tooth. I was
                also at the house when he delivered one of my sisters at our home in Pagan.</p>

                <p>My mother's only brother was the youngest child in her family. She helped to raise
                and take care of him, but as he got older and could groom himself, my mother's
                help became unnecessary. I have no doubt that my mother would have initiated the</p>

                <p>switch at the appropriate time to conform to the appropriate cultural etiquette of
                respeto concerning touching the face and other body parts.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                Respecting our brothers' faces and not touching their upper torso up to their hair
                were things that my mother emphasized as we were growing up. This is a practice
                that we still maintain today, although with a lot less rigidity, as we live in a society
                where we (brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, etc.) hug and kiss each other on
                the cheek. So, obviously, we do not subscribe to the rigid “no upper-body contact”
                of our parents' generation.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                While according respeto by not touching another person's face is still encouraged
                amongst the next generation, there is less emphasis on the rest of the restrictions
                that had been observed in previous generations, including my own.</p>

                <p>XV. Visiting Other People's Homes
                When visiting other people's homes, regardless of whether it is a visit to a relative's
                house or not, Refaluwasch culture forbids entering the house without waiting to be
                invited in first. Moreover, the visitor is also forbidden from going beyond a certain
                point in the house. The visitor should accord proper respeto by remaining near the
                entrance or, if the kitchen were right near the entrance, then refraining from wan-
                dering beyond the kitchen area.</p>

                <p>Another important cultural mandate is that visitors are absolutely forbidden from
                entering the bedroom, which is considered the most private and intimate part
                of the house. Additionally, another respeto etiquette that is part of Refaluwasch
                culture is that visitors are expected to behave respectfully at all times and re-
                frain from being nosy.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                My observation of how my parents behaved while visiting other people's
                homes is wholly consistent with the cultural mandates expected of good and
                polite house guests.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                One of my relatives who was raised by his paternal grandmother recounted that
                whenever he and his grandmother arrived at someone's home, he would knock
                on the door politely and they would wait to be invited into the house. He said that
                upon entering, the first thing that his grandmother would do was glance surrep-
                titiously around the top four corners of the room near the ceiling to quickly and
                discreetly scan the room for any protective local medicines that might be harmful
                to her or him. A discovery of medicines—with potentially harmful spirits there to
                protect only the members of that particular household—often resulted in a quick
                termination of the visit.</p>

                <p>Upon visiting other people's homes, my mother repeatedly expressed that we were
                to remain either near the entrance or in the kitchen for the entire duration of the
                visit. We were also taught that we should be polite and not go to people's homes on
                an empty stomach or to be greedy if food was offered. Another thing my mother was
                adamant about was that under no circumstances were we to ever take anything that
                did not belong to us or to think about coveting anything that did not belong to us.
                Such transgressions would have been met with either a severe verbal tongue lashing
                or, in some instances, a “good” spanking. One must never shame the family.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                We, too, have taught and continue to encourage the next generation of our imme-
                diate family to observe respeto behaviors when visiting other people's homes. We
                often remind them to stay within the established boundaries. Obviously, it is our
                wish and desire that our children remember the lessons even when we are not with
                them as they visit other people's homes.</p>

                <p>XVI. Visitors to Our Home
                Visitors to a Refaluwasch home can expect to be welcomed hospitably. It is custom-
                ary to offer food and beverages to visitors.</p>

                <p>My Parents' Generation
                Growing up in Kagman, Saipan in the mid-1960s, I recall that our isolation from the
                rest of the population was periodically broken when we had visitors on weekends.
                Few people owned cars at the time and the travel distance encouraged relatives to</p>

                <p>stay the weekend when they visited. My parents were gracious hosts who ensured
                that our guests had a pleasant stay with us.</p>

                <p>When we moved to Pagan after my father's election to Congress and his appointment
                as the District Administrator's Representative for the Northern Islands, I observed
                the way my parents went out of their way to be gracious hosts to our visitors. Days
                before the off-island visitors would arrive, my father would go hunting with my rel-
                atives for coconut crabs and other delicacies, which my mother would cook up and
                serve our guests. My father would also go fishing with relatives so that our visitors
                could also eat fish. Because we had a farm, visitors never left without a cargo of wa-
                termelons, mangoes and oranges, as well as coconut crabs, fish and other delicacies
                that were harvested from our island and waters. As to our local on-island visitors,
                they, too, were often welcomed to the house with coffee, other beverages and food.</p>

                <p>My Generation
                When I was growing up, my mother kept us on a very short leash. This was espe-
                cially true after we moved to Saipan following my father's death. We were restricted
                from going to the neighbors' houses to play. Our yard was the extent of our bound-
                ary. Hence, we hosted childhood friends at our home rather than us visiting them at
                their homes. Whenever childhood friends came over to our house to play, my mother
                would insist that we offer them food and beverages the minute they appeared at our
                house. To my mother's way of thinking, offering our visitors food and drinks is a
                good host's first obligation in keeping with respeto practices. However, inviting our
                friends beyond the confines of the kitchen or main common areas was still taboo.
                Under no circumstances were we to ever invite our friends into the bedroom area,
                and this is another practice that we maintain to this day.</p>

                <p>The Next Generation
                Despite our teachings, I cannot say that the members of the next generation in our
                family have always adhered to our cultural teachings in this area. Sometimes, they
                invited their friends beyond the points where visitors are normally allowed access.
                It is only a problem when we learn about this breach after the fact. Some members
                of the next generation choose to ignore this mandate or are completely oblivious to
                the teachings that my mother was very strict about.</p>

                <p>XVII. Conclusion
                The 2010 Census, which includes the census figures for the Commonwealth of
                the Northern Mariana Islands, reported that the total population of Refaluwasch
                (Carolinians) was 2,461, as compared to the total population of 12,902 Chamorros.
                Historically, the Refaluwasch population has always been small, and it has remained
                this way today. Given that we have been in the Marianas since the 1800s, the very
                small size of our Refaluwasch population is an enigma. I maintain that there contin-
                ues to be a threat that we will either perish as a people if our population dwindles
                every generation, or that we perish because we have allowed our unique cultural
                identities to die out. So, what can we do about this?</p>

                <p>I maintain that culture is not static; it is organic—a “living thing”—that evolves
                constantly and is shaped by societal and environmental influences of the time.
                Therefore, it is our responsibility to identify those important core values of our
                Refaluwasch culture worth preserving and take decisive actions to teach and per-
                petuate them while allowing our culture to evolve with the times. In other words, we
                must adapt in order to survive.</p>

                <p>I asked members of the next generation to share what lessons of respeto they had
                learned from their parents and relatives, and I received the following answers:
                    • Behaving respectfully when visiting other people's homes;
                    • Listening and not talking back to their parents;
                    • Doing their chores in a timely manner when asked;
                    • Behaving in school;
                    • Staying off drugs and alcohol;
                    • Staying out of gangs;
                    • Choosing the right friends; and
                    • Attending church on a regular basis.
                This is highly encouraging. What this tells me is that some parents are doing a fine
                job of communicating with their children and imparting important cultural values
                to them. And the good thing about this is that it shows the children are listening.</p>

                <p>Though no child is expected to absorb all of the teachings imparted to them, I nev-
                ertheless commend parents who take the time to actively engage their children in
                lessons on our Refaluwasch cultural beliefs and teachings. And while this is all good</p>

                <p>and positive, we must also remind ourselves that we should not rest on our laurels,
                but remain vigilant in teaching and passing on important core cultural values. It
                is imperative that we continue to reinforce our cultural beliefs and traditions to
                the next generations.</p>

                <p>I attribute some of the next generation's lack of full compliance with our cultural
                teachings to the fact that they are still young and still in training. Despite this under-
                standing, it is quite difficult to assuage feelings of apprehension when a member of
                the next generation in our family commits a cultural faux pas that reflects poorly on
                the family. An example of this would be sitting down to eat in front of visitors with-
                out inviting them to share the meal. In the absence of a polite invitation to partake
                in the meal, the young “offender” ought to have just waited to eat after the visitors
                had left. This is an example of such cringeworthy moments. However, such awkward
                instances also provide us with opportune moments to reinforce the lessons of res-
                peto with renewed vigor. Like one of the perennial favorite mottos often quoted in
                high school student yearbooks says, “If at first you don't succeed, try and try again.”</p>

                <p>Respeto is critical in preserving the way that family members are supposed to inter-
                act with one another. Applied outside of the family, it helps maintain harmonious
                relationships within our own society, as well as during our interactions with other
                societies. It is easier to teach and pass on what we still have than it is to reinvent what
                we have lost. We ought to choose the path of least resistance. Like our language,
                teaching respeto must begin at home. This is where it must start. Then, it ought to be
                reinforced by our schools, churches and the community at large. Our government
                must also be actively involved in this objective. All Refaluwasch have a stake in this;
                everyone must get involved. We can do this together. As another popular saying
                goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.”</p>

                <p>Our history teaches us that we are survivors. We are alive today because our
                Refaluwasch ancestors boldly set sail across open ocean in search of a new, safer
                home here in the Marianas. If we can survive devastating earthquakes, floods and
                typhoons, we can surely survive modernity, too! Let us continue to navigate through
                life's modernity without losing the Refaluwasch identity.</p>

                <p>Lastly, allow me to take this moment to acknowledge and thank the following people
                who made my contribution to this book possible. First, a huge danke and olomwaay
                to NMC's Ajani S. Burrell for his guidance, support and sheer persistence in re-
                cruiting me to participate in this book project, thereby ensuring that a Refaluwasch
                (Carolinian) voice is also heard; to Dr. Kimberly Bunts-Anderson, also of NMC, for
                her helpful edits and guidance; to Dr. Don Rubinstein at the University of Guam
                for his immensely helpful edits; to the CNMI Humanities Council for making these
                types of valuable community projects possible; to my anonymous Refaluwasch in-
                terviewees and consultants whose invaluable time, input and substantive reviews
                made me strive even harder to produce a more inclusive and accurate contribution
                to this book project; to Representative Sheila J. Babauta for her invaluable support;
                and, last, but not least, I extend a huge olomwaay to Mrs. Margarita Olopai-Taitano,
                my Refaluwasch Editor, not only for her substantive reviews and invaluable input,
                but also for patiently and painstakingly correcting most of my horrible Refaluwasch
                spellings. You all have my immense humble gratitude and respeto.</p>

                <p>“The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day
                runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.
                It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of
                grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.
                It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow.
                I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.
                And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.”

                <p>The åsuli (freshwater eels) live here, it is their home. Does my presence frighten
                them? Do they know I am just passing through, scribbling notes of their existence in
                the margins of a tattered map? Where will they go if the streams stop flowing year-
                round and access between the ridges and sea vanishes? They have a long journey
                ahead of them—we all do.</p>

                <p>Sitting carefully on the jagged karst every week for the last few years has turned the
                uncomfortable familiar, the karst and my discomfort worn smooth by our time to-
                gether. In the freshwater pool, a ripple disrupts the fogged mirror-like water. Drops
                trickling against polished stone echo among the surrounding cliffs, disrupted only
                by the occasional call of one small silk-feathered såli, a native bird in Luta (Rota). I
                sink the metal-encased end of a multiparameter water quality meter into the water.
                Delicately calibrated to calculate aquatic chemistry, the instrument garners curi-
                osity from the uhang (shrimp) with their little claws and delicate pereiopods. They
                climb and crawl on the instrument without fear. Can they remember it from the
                week before? Sinking to the muddy bottom, the machine works a neoteric kind of
                wizardry to offer me information whose meaning remains confined to spreadsheets
                or my limited baseline knowledge.</p>

                <p>When I first arrived in Rota a few years back, I regularly ventured out of the office
                to conduct fieldwork necessary for building both intimacy and awareness of the
                Talakhaya coastalscape, the place where land, sea, and the more-than-human as-
                semblage meet. Although researchers have been here for decades, there remains a
                sense of mystery emanating from the limestone forests, as though no accumulation
                of knowledge could ever quite encapsulate the spirit of the island. Unlike many
                of my colleagues here, who are dedicated to the monitoring and recovery of the
                endangered åga (Marianas crow) or fanihi (Marianas fruit bat), my commitments
                revolve around the priority watershed on the south side of the island. Fires, clear-cut-
                ting, sugar cane, more fires, erosion, another fire, and the seemingly endless pursuit
                to stabilize the soils with non-native grasses and nursery-grown native tree species
                have left the watershed in a perpetual state of recovery. These pursuits are not mine
                alone, the burden of growth and loss shared across generations and between islands.</p>

                <p>“Everything is part of a watershed.” This innocuous statement is radical in nature,
                particularly given the fact that many of us know very little about the watershed we
                inhabit, let alone watersheds in general. Watershed is loosely defined as the “line
                separating waters flowing into different rivers,” where a shed represents the “ridge of
                high ground between two valleys or lower ground, a divide” (Soanes and Stevenson,
                2004, p. 1632). A quick search of catchment area maps or drainage divides or water
                basins, which are watersheds of a different name, will produce images such as
                Figure 1 of countries and communities redrawn with colorful, chaotic shapes that
                rarely share similarities with the borders of states or countries that we are familiar
                with. Hydro-cartographies could not care less about politics and nationalism.</p>

                <p>The Talakhaya Watershed is one of five watersheds on Rota (Figure 2) and is locat-
                ed in the south of the island, where there are no paved roads and few permanent
                structures. Turning the corner at Poña Point, you can look up at the steep slopes that
                define the watershed, deep green in the wet season and an eerie brown in the midst
                of the dry season. A decade ago, the community came together with support from
                government agencies to establish Talakhaya as a “priority watershed,” a term related
                to NOAA's Coral Reef Initiative, which allowed for a steady stream of funding to
                recover and revegetate the exposed soils of the watershed in the hopes of reducing
                erosion and conserving the adjacent coral reefs. The process led to the Conservation
                Area designation, the publication of the Conservation Action Plan, and implemen-
                tation of the annual revegetation project. However, success for the project, for a
                return to the pristine limestone forests that once graced the southern coast, is de-
                pendent on the commitments of community members to care for the slopes as they
                would their own homes.</p>

                <p>Note. Each area is defined by a combination of geological, topological, and fluvial aspects. The Talakhaya water-
                shed is of particular interest because it is the only place on the island where the water flows on the surface. From
                The watersheds of Rota [Image], by CNMI Bureau of Environmental and Costal Quality (BECQ) – Division of

                <p>To know a watershed, from a data-driven natural-science perspective, demands
                familiarity with a wide range of disciplines: geology to understand the way stones
                and aquifers alter the hyporheic flows where the water moves beneath the surface;
                hydrology to grasp the influence of sediments and nutrients on the quality of flow-
                ing water and the resulting change in its chemistry; biology to sense the way fish
                and shrimp and trees and birds all depend on the ecosystem that encompasses
                them.; ecology to comprehend the depth of interconnectedness; and sociology to
                discern the human bond with the coastalscape. Soil composition, historical land-
                use changes, impacts on coral reefs, and the infrastructure that allows us to pass
                through, study, grow, and depend on the watershed also have dedicated life-long
                pursuits of knowledge.</p>

                <p>The Talakhaya Watershed is overflowing with these knowledges, much of it hidden,
                but enough sensually accessible for me as a researcher. Squatting on the edge of the
                freshwater pool, I am struck by how much I do not know. What species of fish is that?
                Why is the water suddenly so turbid? Has this shoreline erosion increased since the
                first people wandered these same veins? Notebook in one hand, camera attached to
                my backpack, dirt under my fingernails. There are divides everywhere, each stream
                its own watershed. Stories are woven into the roots holding streambanks in place.
                Watersheds turn into subwatersheds that turn into subsubwatersheds that turn
                into innocuous pools of water that vanish when it is either too hot or too wet to
                sustain their borders.</p>

                <p>Leaning over the muddled waters with a small plastic bag to gather water samples, I
                freeze as something flashes out of sight beneath the sunken leaves and stones. Was
                that just an apparition, a trick caused by shifting light and waterlogged branches?
                No, this anguillid has been carefully documented in my notes, defying its nocturnal
                habits to make its presence known to the visitor that returns once again. Åsuli, more
                commonly known as giant mottled eels or Anguilla marmorata, spend the majority of
                their lives hidden in the muddy depths of freshwater pools, where they can sustain
                themselves on a steady supply of uhang and avoid the impacts of oppressive dry
                seasons. While it is often hard to discern the age of an åsuli just by looking at them,
                they can live for decades in the slopes and streams of Talakhaya.</p>

                <p>During my first trek into the jungle accompanied by a young taotao tåno' (Indigenous
                person, literally “people of the land”) trained to understand the equipment and sci-
                entific procedures, I asked questions like “how many waterfalls are there?” or “what
                unique species call these streams home?” He offered relatively few answers while
                acknowledging a lack of expertise in such things, which he attributed to his age and
                education. “Faisen i mañaina, ask the elders,” he advised. I soon came to learn that
                the knowledge of this ecosystem had been lost over time, from the Spanish colo-
                nization to the American standardized testing system. Only in the last decade has
                local ecological knowledge been incorporated into the school curriculum, with only
                a few species and habitats getting recognized. In many cases, it comes down to the
                passion of an individual teacher to make sure åsuli or fanihi or åga are even men-
                tioned in the classroom.</p>

                <p>While my work partner stood on the streambank and I knelt in the stream with my
                hands clasped around the multiparameter instrument, he shared his story about
                getting to know the watershed more in the last year than he had in his whole life.
                His position was bound to Talakhaya and the revegetation project, supported by the
                local environmental agencies. Trained to raise plants in the nursery, collect stream
                water samples, and monitor the revegetation efforts, he acknowledged how little his
                friends knew about the way the streams change and shift throughout the year. There
                are few, if any, lesson plans dedicated to the streams of Luta and even fewer oppor-
                tunities for students to travel the relatively short distance to the southern side of the
                island to gain familiarity with Talakhaya. And with climatic changes on the horizon,
                there are some lessons that will only make their way into history books.</p>

                <p>The dry season is in full swing as I trek along the stream towards higher ground.
                During the months when the rains are sporadic and the soils are vulnerable, majestic
                falls become mud pits tainted with the scent of rotting fish and occupied by raven-
                ous hilitai, the mangrove monitor lizards, with their sharp claws and jagged teeth.
                Babbling streams turn speechless, streambanks collapse under their own weight, the
                scientific instruments (Figure 3) used to measure water quality lose their telos. While
                the more serious impacts of climate change are still on the horizon, others have al-
                ready made themselves known. Even during my geologically fleeting presence in the
                watershed the last few years, change arrived drastically compared to the historical re-
                cords describing the ecosystem. One landowner, whose surname is synonymous with
                one of the island's villages, called the changes unprecedented in the many decades
                he had been there. Watching the rheic, the aboveground flow, creep meter by meter
                further inland every week, I would leave the jungle full of sadness and confusion,
                uncertain that my efforts to craft a management plan to protect this place for future
                generations would matter. How will the åsuli find their way without flowing water, I
                wondered. What will sustain the residents of Rota if the waters run dry?</p>

                <p>During a stakeholder planning workshop held in the mayor's office, the participants
                grapple with similar questions. Standing around a plastic table draped in a printed
                map of the entire conservation area of Talakhaya, including symbols for streams,
                properties, and critical habitats for a few of the endangered and endemic species
                of Talakhaya, debate ensues over the biggest threats to watershed health: invasive
                ungulates, intentionally set fires, erosion of the badlands, climate change, politics.
                Sticky notes scribbled with these very words are placed in their rightful locations
                and concern mounts as the map vanishes beneath the yellow and pink pieces of
                paper. In a room full of community members who have the greatest familiarity with
                the watershed, we all feel humbled by the sheer challenge of managing the coast-
                alscape, particularly given the diminishing resources available. Just like the streams
                drying up, so too are our chances to reverse course and establish a resilient future for
                the watershed and its human and non-human inhabitants.
                In my attempt to more accurately map the freshwater veins of the watershed,
                upon whose source every human resident of the island depends, I stick as close</p>

                <p>to the stream edge as I can. While it is fairly common knowledge that 90% of the
                island's drinking water comes from Talakhaya, it became abundantly clear at the
                stakeholder workshops that accurate and micro-level maps of the various features
                of the watershed are non-existent and are needed. From missing streams to vague
                allusions to the locations of invasive species, our current maps are not sufficient for
                the goals. The streams are dangerously inaccessible to most people, the biologists
                and the deer hunters notwithstanding. Eventually, the dense foliage completely
                thwarts my progress, forcing me to fumble forward on my hands and knees until the
                tropical limestone forest gives way to colossal grasses and treacherous ridgelines.
                The familiar warmth and brilliance of the sun disorient me after hours protect-
                ed beneath the canopy.</p>

                <p>Pulling my tired legs up the steep incline, I approach a cluster of stones situated
                higher than the jungle below. Sitting down and looking out across the rolling hills
                with scattered emerald patches left intact after decades of habitat destruction, I
                wonder what this land looked like before all the clear-cutting. Massive scrapes of ex-
                posed rock remain where the depleted topsoil has vanished, leaving behind barren
                uninhabitable earth, glaring scars when seen from above. From my pocket, I unfold
                a map and begin to trace my finger along the dark green veins, canopied sanctuaries
                for freshwater pumping fertility into the region, and the barren patches of brown
                denoting the dried-out savannah.</p>

                <p>The neighboring ridges obscure the decades of monumental effort taken to secure
                the exposed soils and eventually return the landscape to limestone forest. Hundreds
                of thousands of non-native grasses specifically chosen for their ability to hold soils
                and prevent erosion have been transplanted from nurseries on the other side of the
                island. A group of nursery assistants are hired every year to propagate the seeds of
                Bahiagrass and Vetiver in addition to as many endemic trees as the germination of
                seeds can provide. A few months later, a dozen volunteers drive up the treacherous
                trails and carry the seedlings over ridges and through valleys to reach the next area
                requiring revegetation. Their hands are saving the watershed, their efforts are giving
                the åsuli and all the native species a fighting chance in the face of climate change.</p>

                <p>The revegetation efforts are situated on ground once ravished by human invaders,
                occupiers of these islands, who clear-cut large swaths of the native jungle that once
                existed on the ridges between each valley. It is hard to say when the landscape level
                changes really started, but the small monuments demarcating the existence of an old
                Japanese sugarcane company may signal the last major alteration. The revegetation
                project is transitioning towards planting more trees next year, with the stated goal
                of returning the area to its past existence, a lush forest that may only ever exist in
                stories. We debate feasibility and fundability and capability in a small office, while
                the whole future of the watershed is clouded in uncertainty. Our efforts sometimes
                feel like an Anguillidian ouroboros, an eel eating its own tail.</p>

                <p>Most years, they are able to bring a group of students up to the area to assist in the
                project. Under the glare of the sun, without any nearby canopy, the young volun-
                teers get dirt under their nails as they place the grasses into divots dug out by an
                experienced Luta Livelihoods volunteer. After only a few hours, they are exhausted,
                sweat falling from their arms and chins. One young woman sitting nearby taking a
                needed break mentions to me how she had no idea people were planting trees in
                Talakhaya to prevent erosion from destroying the adjacent reefs. “Is this all that we
                can do?” she questions. The following day, the same students gather on a beach to
                don snorkels and explore one of the nearby reefs, after a brief lecture about what we
                as individuals can do to help protect corals. Maybe there is still hope.</p>

                <p>On my last workday in Rota, I sat on exposed karst stones with James Manglona,
                Rota's Forester for CNMI Forestry (Figure 4). The sun was irradiating us, grass whis-
                pered with the occasional breeze, volunteers chatted while they worked nearby.
                The sweat puddled on our brows, and I expressed concern that I had accomplished
                so little, that what I had learned over the last few years painted a grim scene for
                the Talakhaya watershed. James, the coastalscape's greatest champion, reassured
                me that every person who has dedicated time to protecting the watershed matters,
                particularly when change is already present. Without him, there would be no resto-
                ration, no soil-securing grasses, no hope for the myriad of non-humans that grace
                the lands and seas around us. “Will you come back?” It sounded more like an invi-
                tation than a question. We both recognize the persistent difficulty of conservation
                when capacity continues to recede like streams in the dry season. With his support
                and the commitments of the stakeholders, a plan is in place that should ensure
                funds for the foreseeable future. The silence between us faded as we got back to the</p>

                <p>work at hand, continuing along the perimeter of the annual revegetation project to
                more accurately map that year's success.</p>

                <p>The sound of approaching rainfall forces me from my perch on the exposed stones
                as I quickly tuck away the map. The rain carries both life and destruction for this col-
                lection of Strahler-numbered watersheds (the Strahler-number is a mathematical
                approach to identify and label the branching network of tributaries within streams,
                rivers, or watersheds). As the droplets seep into the arid soils, the flora exalts for
                sustenance in the midst of the dry season. At the same time, along the edges of the
                delicately carved streams, the weight of the moisture begins to rip trees and shrubs
                and stones from their once-stable banks. As the rainwater rushes down from the
                mountain it fills with sediment, altering the mapped streamlines and eventually suf-
                focating the increasingly vulnerable corals that seem worlds away. Lasting for only a
                brief moment, the clouds disappear over a few ridges in the distance, leaving behind
                the comforting scent of petrichor and a drenched desire to reverse course, head back
                down into the veins below, and return to the parked truck.</p>

                <p>Carefully navigating downstream, the scent of moss and decomposing leaves and
                water teeming with a microbial universe refreshes and soothes me. Suddenly, I
                glimpse the marbled form of an åsuli caught in a pool no larger than itself, cut off
                from the flowing waters that just rushed through this sheltered valley. Crouching
                down no more than an arm's length away, I cause the anguillid to recoil in its limit-
                ed space, trapped and separated. A familiar predicament for this isolated scientist.
                Eating freshwater eels was historically undertaken by the lower mañåchang caste
                of the archipelago, allowed only if caught by hand since they were forbidden from
                using fishing tools and spears (Cunningham, 1992). Stories told by the inhabitants of
                another island lament the harvesting of the reclusive creatures, sold to markets in
                distant places that had already exhausted their local eel populations (Pacific Worlds,
                n.d.). Some believe that the Anguilla marmorata (Figure 5) dig deep holes to open up
                the underground artesian wells, leukocytes ensuring the caves continue to supply
                blood to this ecosystem.</p>

                <p>Figure 5
                Juvenile Åsuli Found in One of Talakhaya's Streams</p>

                <p>Note. From Malcolm Johnson, 2018.</p>

                <p>The small black eyes meet my own and stillness overtakes us both. I wonder if it
                would be best to continue onward, taking a wide arc away from the confused giant
                mottled eel and allowing fate to take its course. Fleetingly, I contemplate reaching in
                and grasping my companion, if I could be so bold to find solidarity with such a mag-
                nificent being, in order to assist in relocation to a more abundant body of freshwater.
                Or would my attempt just result in distress for the åsuli and the stream, which have
                found a delicate balance without my intrusion? Just when I have decided on how</p>

                <p>to respond, a flicker of brown and yellow dances between my legs, shimmies across
                polished stones, and vanishes over a ledge in the distance that conceals a shallow
                pool inhabited by uhang. The dry season will come to an end soon and access to
                food and the sea will be in reach.</p>

                <p>Continuing towards the forest's exit, the murmur of the stream fades and all that is
                left is the scraping of stones beneath my boots and the occasional joyful cry from
                the fluttering såli (starling) that seems to have followed me throughout the day's
                journey. Signs of the hyporheic zone—the spongy sub-streambed— manifest in
                the sinking of footprints into the muddy streambed and the stoic cane toads wal-
                lowing in moistened crevices, a species native to the Americas, introduced to this
                liminal space in order to control pernicious beetles from decimating the fields of
                sugar cane. Hitchhiking across oceans with their human counterparts, the highly
                toxic toads have colonized islands all over the world, outcompeting the indigenous
                amphibians, filling puddles with countless eggs, consuming anything that will fit
                in their massive mouths, including the juvenile åsuli. There is no plan to curb their
                population here, just to accept their existence and pray that they do not cause any
                more ecological damage.</p>

                <p>Managing, protecting, and conserving watersheds is a monumental task. It can take
                dozens of people, multiple meetings, and hundreds of hours researching, writing,
                and monitoring just to reach some kind of consensus on what needs to be done to
                ensure resilience for a single species, let alone an entire coastalscape. Yet the in-
                terconnectedness of all the flora, fauna, waters, soils, infrastructure, histories, and
                humans that move in and out of the basin makes every response to the identified
                threats subject to conflict and uncertainty. We need to repair the road to reach the
                water cave, but what about the endangered damselfly? No hunting is allowed in the
                conservation area, yet the deer keep eating all the endemic trees that are out-plant-
                ed. In passing, someone mentions climate change at a stakeholder meeting, and
                everyone shifts uneasily in their seats. The streams ran dry again this year and the
                corpses of åsuli were found in one of the deepest dried-out pools.</p>

                <p>Competing cultures reign supreme in stakeholder meetings in Rota, with one con-
                stituency arguing for the need to protect wildlife so that it can be harvested as the
                ancestors had done, while another sees the “undeveloped” areas of Talakhaya as an
                opportunity for a new hotel, without mentioning the two abandoned hotels passed
                on the way to the meeting. Someone in the room will distrust the government for
                letting the habitat destruction continue in one area or for neglecting to repair a road
                in desperate need of stabilization. Another person sits silently and only leans in
                to remind everyone of the importance of a particular cultural site or an endemic
                species habitat. There are arguments over the use of pesticides, debates over who
                is the responsible entity, and disagreements over the lack of enforcement. Even the
                most knowledgeable residents struggle to agree on what is best for everyone and
                everything in Talakhaya.</p>

                <p>As I duck beneath the cement footbridge, the rolling sound of waves in the distance
                begins to echo through the depths of the dynamic world hidden beneath the dark
                green veins of the map. Hearing the latching of a car door, I peak over the rocky
                bank and decide to climb out and introduce myself to the couple loading bunches
                of bananas and pugua (betelnut) into the back of their corroded pickup truck. They
                tell me about harvesting dozens of different species, catching freshwater prawns,
                and utilizing the land for decades based on knowledge passed down from their par-
                ents. I tell them about my research on the streams, and the goal of establishing a
                management plan for the watershed. The man reminisces: “When I was younger,
                I counted all the waterfalls for a class project with the help of my father.” He had
                forgotten the exact number by now, guessing, “Fifty maybe?” This was one of the
                recurring questions I asked friends and colleagues and community members: “How
                many waterfalls do you think Rota has?”</p>

                <p>Sitting in one of the restaurants in town on Sunday mornings early in my stay, I
                would introduce myself to fellow diners and talk about my hopes for my next 3 years
                in Rota. I would always inquire about their local knowledge of the watershed, usual-
                ly starting with that simple waterfall question. I asked the same question to kids in
                all the schools. The answer was always “one,” or maybe “five” if they assumed each
                major stream had one. In the second year, I conducted a survey about the watershed
                and the environmental resources of Rota in general. Still the same answers on the
                number of waterfalls, which made sense given that the most frequent responses for
                “time spent in the watershed” were “never” or “once a year.” If you define waterfalls
                by a height taller than your average male, there are close to 70—some taller than 20
                meters—and nearly all traversed by åsuli.</p>

                <p>The couple and I speak about changes in the climate they have experienced in their
                lifetime, like the once perennial streams now dry more days of the year than flowing,
                and our fears for future climatic disturbances inevitably submerging the island's
                village beneath the tides. She asks me about the water cave, the source of the wet-
                lands, which secures the precious waters for human usage. “What impacts are our
                actions having on the streams?” she asks. Offering only predictions and hypothe-
                ses, I encourage them to participate in the next stakeholder meeting to share their
                thoughts with the rest of the community. Before continuing my descent, I question
                them about their familiarity with the åsuli inhabiting the waters. He recalls how
                his family would ensnare only the largest, taking no more than once per year from
                the same green vein, yet they have become so rare he can no longer recall the last
                time one was caught.</p>

                <p>Conversations like this were rare when venturing out into the watershed, a place on
                the island where I would most easily achieve solitude. On one occasion, I stumbled
                upon two older gentlemen wearing wetsuits torn to shreds, floating in water only a
                few feet deep and filling woven baskets with uhang. I asked them how often they
                collect the freshwater prawns. “A few times a year, although it is much easier when
                the streams run partially dry” was the response. On another occasion, I surprised
                a couple newly arrived on the island eating their lunch next to the most popular
                waterfall on the island. After reminding them to not leave behind trash, I asked how
                often they came out here. “This is our first time,” they told me. I wondered if it would
                be their only time. I questioned others I encountered. A non-local guide taking a
                group of tourists wearing zoris and carrying umbrellas up the main trail. A Public
                Works employee on his way to clear foliage hanging over the dirt road. My questions
                always have the same intention, attempts at piecing together the story of the water-
                shed through their stories and their relationships with Talakhaya.</p>

                <p>When I am not wandering around the watershed, my questions seem to garner a sim-
                ilar sentiment, whether I am sitting in one of the restaurants or waiting at the post
                office or presenting at the school or conducting surveys. The watershed and the reveg-
                etation project are held in high esteem by the people of Rota, regardless of familiarity.
                After 10 years of volunteers spending their summers planting grasses and trees in the
                badlands, most of the community is aware of the project and the value of the water-
                shed. However, only a select few have a comprehensive understanding of what was, is,
                and can be. While I am sitting alone for breakfast on a Sunday morning, a manåmko'
                (an elder) waves me over and asks me how the revegetation is going. He used to work
                for CNMI Forestry and was impressed with how much the landscape has changed
                since the inception of the project. “What comes next for Talakhaya?” he wondered.
                A transition to planting only native trees, renovations to the roads in order to reduce
                sedimentation, or nothing much at all. The future is still very uncertain. Who will
                champion the watershed's future? Who can?</p>

                <p>Passing a few more cane toads, who frantically hop whichever direction they are
                facing, a large shadow swoops across my path. I catch a glimpse of the blackened
                wingspan of the endemic åga who laughs and teases me from the sparse canopy
                while I stumble through the jungle. Recording the location in a small waterproof
                notebook, to be passed on later to the endangered crow researchers also dedicated
                to the maps and blemishes of this island, I step out into the looming sunlight once
                again. Trust from the community does not come easy for scientists from the main-
                land—trust eroded by fights over land and over the protection of endangered species.
                Sometimes seen as another symptom of the federal government's possession of the
                islands, we must be careful not to take ownership over our findings—information
                does not exist in isolation.</p>

                <p>As I try to piece together the history of the watershed, it became increasingly evident
                that the knowledge of the landscape existed in the silos of academia, was forgotten over
                time, or never even reached the community. Scouring dusty documents written in the
                late 1980s, I would find information that no one on the island seemed to remember,
                maybe because it was never shared beyond the academic publication. The biologists
                did not connect with the sociologists who neglected the geologists who could not care
                less about the farmers tilling their land. As the management plan came together, we
                tried to weave a tapestry out of peer-reviewed papers, the conversations with residents,
                and åkgak (pandanus leaves). Even if a plan cannot provide lasting protection for an
                ecosystem, it can serve as a repository for all the stories, facts, figures, maps, and hopes
                for Talakhaya. Maybe in a few years, drawn by the tides, someone will pick up the
                plan and feel inspired to let the streams flow through their veins, to find joy in the
                non-native grasses, and to dance for the health of the watershed.</p>

                <p>With the sea breeze pushing against me and the limestone forest to my back, I scan the
                exposed coral reefs being hammered by waves. How do the fragile åsuli navigate these
                tumultuous waters? Hatching from eggs in an unknown location in the middle of the
                ocean west of the archipelago, the larval leptocephali drift with the currents until they
                reach islands throughout the Pacific Ocean. Through some kind of magic, they dis-
                cover this small watershed in the vastness, morph into elvers so they can swim up one
                of the five streams and their towering waterfalls, and live demersally for two to four
                decades in freshwater pools as yellow eels. Eventually, their mucus-covered bodies un-
                dergo one last metamorphosis that signals their need to swim out to sea. Transforming
                into silver eels, they return to the same bearings in the middle of the sea to spawn and
                perish, their corpses serving as nutrients for their offspring, an ocean cradle of birth
                and of death (Schofield and Fuller, 2021).</p>

                <p>Returning to my beat-up red truck that survived an onslaught of falling breadfruit
                from the neighboring tree, I think about the familiar journey of the åsuli. We both
                found this island by chance, becoming our home the moment we felt the freshwater
                flowing upon our faces, both destined one day to leave towards the sea. My muddied
                fingers trace the dark greens of the map once more, remembering each tempestuous
                encounter solely by touch. What if the åsuli cannot reach the ocean due to the changing
                climate? When the elders sink to the bottom of the pools and are consumed by micro-
                bial decomposers, who will feel the impacts of the last scaled spirit vanishing from
                the ecosystem? When all that remains of the anguillidae are points scribbled on maps
                and stories shared in classrooms full of distracted children, how will my intrusion on
                the banks and cliffs be measured? I am just another impact of the Anthropocene, one
                more visitor carving lines and points out of the living landscape. Watershed manage-
                ment plans cannot restore the connection between humans and the giant mottled eel,
                severed with each successive ruinous colonization, be it human or non-native species.</p>

                <p>Managing a watershed or an ecosystem or even a single species seems near impossible
                from this vantage point. Charting stakeholder relationships generates a complex web
                of interconnected yet competing interests not unlike the multifaceted food webs grac-
                ing science textbooks. Strategic actions can only answer questions that we know, yet
                the complex coastalscape demands more. Like the åsuli, with their lives spread across
                massive spatiotemporal scales, management plans must grasp at the extant knowl-
                edge, informed by the past, with eyes towards the future. Climate change expectations,
                casino projects covered in gold leaf, the collapse of fisheries, clashes over freshwater
                resources. The stories from Talakhaya have changed every decade and will continue
                to transform. A 10-year-old stands before Okgok Falls for the first time, smiling as her
                elementary school teacher excitedly snaps pictures of Gua'a, the largest waterfall on
                the island. A lifelong landowner sits attentively during a workshop about funding for
                watershed-friendly land use changes. A local biologist presents her findings in the
                mayor's office to a small group of interested community members. Thousands of
                human lives, to say nothing of untold other species, all connected to the watershed
                and its uncertain future.</p>

                <p>The truck and I bounce along the pothole-ravaged road constructed from the crushed
                remains of deceased coral colonies. Approaching the aircon-chilled office sheltering
                all the daily threnody for the åsuli, sights of the horizon prompts thoughts of future
                watershed acquaintances. On some islands the eels are invasive, on others they are
                endangered. What would I whisper in those vascular jungles to ask for permission
                and forgiveness for my incursions? These streams are the veins that flow through my
                hands, finding comfort in the well-known axilla of this limestone temple. The patterns
                are versant, the flow prosaic. Yet the attempts to gather knowledge mar the landscape,
                another outsider bearing the gift of colonization in the guise of conservation, arriving
                and leaving like many of the other researchers who temporarily call this place home.
                It only takes a few months for the eels to float to their freshwater sanctuary, satisfied to
                remain until their final gambol beyond the lagoon.</p>

                <p>I Tinituhon (In the Beginning): Homelands
                Some 3,500 or more years ago, i Manaotaomo'na (the People of Before; Chamorro
                or CHamoru ancestors) voyaged to and made their home in what we today call the
                Mariana Islands (Historic Resources Division, 2006, p. 7). I Manaotaomo'na had
                their own way of referring to their home islands—Låguas for the southern islands
                or perhaps the entire archipelago (meaning long and slender), and Gåni for the
                group of islands north of Sa'ipan (Chamisso, 1817, as cited in Barratt, 1984, p. 28; L.
                Cunningham, personal communication, March 14, 2017; Russell, 1998). Following
                Indigenous protocols, i Manaotaomo'na fished and voyaged throughout the 550-mile
                length of the archipelago, from the northernmost island of Uråkas to the southern-
                most, Guåhan, or Guam (Figure 1) (Coomans, 1997; Furey, 2006, p. 44; Russell, 1998).
                They gathered and cultivated åmot (traditional medicines) and foods like dokdok
                (native seeded breadfruit), lemmai (seedless breadfruit), and suni (taro) in coastal
                plains and interior portions of the islands. They also hunted various paluma siha
                (birds) and other delicacies such as fanihi (fruit bat) and harvested other valued</p>

                <p>resources like åkgak (pandanus) for weaving, fotfot siha (trees) to carve into canoes,
                and ålutong (volcanic rock) to utilize as stone tools.</p>

                <p>Note. The SAINA, seen sailing here between Guåhan and Luta (Rota), was the first sakman crafted in Låguas yan
                Gåni in over 250 years owing to the intensive missionization and colonization of CHamorus (Chamorros; the
                Chamorro people) from 1698 on. Those foreign impositions greatly transformed aspects of traditional culture
                and at times, specifically banned oceangoing voyaging (Cepeda et al., n.d.; Cunningham, personal communica-
                tion, March 14, 2017). From Ron Castro, personal communication, March 14, 2017. Copyright 2017 by Ron Castro

                <p>Låguas yan Gåni are where i Manaotaomo'na became uniquely Taotao Tåno' (People
                of the Land), or CHamoru (Chamorros; the Chamorro people) as is described in
                the traditional oral narrative Fo'na and Pontan (B. Cruz, personal communication,
                2016; Hattori, 2021; G. E. Taitano, n.d.b). Låguas yan Gåni are thus a homeland for
                i Manaotaomo'na and their descendants. Former Governor of Guåhan Ricardo J.
                Bordallo expressed the depth of the CHamoru sentiment for their homeland, which
                can be applied to Låguas and Gåni more broadly, when he said,
                    Guam is not just a piece of real estate to be exploited for its money-making po-
                    tential. Above all else, Guam is the homeland of the Chamorro people. That is
                    a fundamental, undeniable truth. We are profoundly “taotao [tåno']”—people
                    of the land. This land … belongs to us just as surely, just as inseparably, as we
                    belong to it. No tragedy of history or declaration of conquest, no legalistic dou-
                    ble-talk can change that fact. (Phillips, n.d.)
                At some point in those ancestral times, i Manaotaomo'na developed trading rela-
                tionships with others in the region including neighboring Refaluwasch (Carolinian
                Islanders) who voyaged to Låguas yan Gåni seeking i Manaotaomo'na pottery, med-
                icine, and more. After centuries of this relationship, in the early 1800s, Refaluwásch
                voyaged to settle the islands to the north of Guåhan and are also thus formally
                recognized as Indigenous to those islands (Figure 2) (Farrell, 2011, pp. 192–201).</p>

                Festival's opening ceremonies. The Festival provided an opportunity for Guåhan's wider community to under-
                stand themselves as being part of a Pacific Island community and to encounter Pacific Islanders from other parts
                of Oceania. Photo from Kelly G. Marsh-Taitano.</p>

                <p>I Matulalaikan i Måtan Guåhan (The Changing Face of Guåhan)
                I Manaotaomo'na thrived in their homelands, over time settling islands throughout
                the archipelago as attested by the latte (stone foundational supports for structures),
                lusong (stone mortars), stone paved areas, åcho' atupat (slingstones), haguet (fish-
                hooks), and other heritage items that exist there still. Their sphere of contact with
                others further expanded in 1521, when i Manaotaomo'na discovered a Spanish ex-
                ploratory expedition in their waters. This encounter initiated semi-regular trade
                with the Spanish, which then eventually led to missionization and colonization of
                Låguas yan Gåni (1695-1899), despite nearly three decades of resistance by sizeable</p>

                <p>numbers of i Manaotaomo'na (Atienza, 2013; García, 2004). Although significant
                features of CHamoru culture, like ocean voyaging and traditional dance, were lost
                or otherwise challenged and transformed in this and later colonial administrations,
                i Manaotaomo'na and their descendants have consistently maintained key aspects
                of their culture and customs, such as retaining the centrality of family in their lives
                (Souder, 1992; Underwood, n.d.). Further, many of the impositions or desired outside
                cultural features were CHamorucized to suit CHamoru sensibilities and preferences
                rather than adopted wholesale (see, for example, Figure 3).</p>

                lonial administration from “New Spain” (Mexico). The Spanish at the time also had colonies in parts of the
                Americas, including what is now referred to as Mexico. From Edward B. San Nicolas, personal communication,

                <p>The lengthy Spanish administration of i Taotao Guåhan (Chamorros of Guam)
                ended abruptly with the Spanish-American War of 1898. The United States seized
                Guåhan while the northern islands were sold to Germany shortly thereafter (and
                then subsequently taken over by Japan in World War I, and administered by the
                United States following WWII). Over time, these two divisions of Låguas yan Gåni de-
                veloped into the US unincorporated Territory of Guam and the US Commonwealth
                of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI or NMI), as they are known today (Farrell,
                2011; Hattori, 2006). This political divvying up of a homeland and the peoples upon
                it tore apart a society and the families within it, without the involvement of the very
                CHamorus, Refaluwasch, and others present who were directly affected. At times,
                these borders imposed by outside forces have been closed by administering powers,
                thereby slowing or stopping completely the traditional flow and reciprocation
                among families. Such circumstances have produced some distinctions over time
                between the i Taotao Guåhan and those of the northern islands.</p>

                <p>Perhaps indicative of pre-colonial population patterns and later colonial reinforce-
                ment, Guåhan is the most heavily populated island within Låguas yan Gåni. The
                2020 Census of Guam tallied 153,836 CHamorus, Refaluwásch, other Micronesians
                and Pacific Islanders, and peoples from islands and continents near and far who call
                Guåhan home (US Census Bureau, 2021). However, similar to other Pacific Islanders,
                a majority of CHamorus (from both Guåhan and NMI) now reside outside their
                homeland islands, with at least 63% living in the United States, a trend that appears
                to be on the rise (Figures 4 and 5). CHamorus live in every state in the United States,
                from California and Washington to Texas, New York, and Florida, with an unknown
                number living within other US territories such as Puerto Rico and American Samoa
                (Hixson et al., 2012). If it were possible to count the thousands of other CHamorus
                living abroad outside the United States, the percentages would shift even further,
                maybe markedly so. Many find this trend of Indigenous depopulation of their
                homeland for both for Guåhan and NMI disturbing (F. Untalan, personal commu-
                nication, March 17, 2017). Conversely, there are some CHamorus from the States or
                elsewhere who intentionally return home to connect with the land, know their fam-
                ilies, and learn the culture as it is practiced in the islands.</p>

                <p>Note. In 2000, the majority of those who self-identified as CHamoru for the US Census were still living in their
                home islands. Some of these figures may be misleading, however, owing to factors related to lack of self-iden-
                tification or inadequacy in census race/ethnicity categories. “Other US” does not include the territories of
                Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, or American Samoa as US Census agents were not able to verify whether any
                CHamoru resided in those areas. Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding off of figures. Adapted

                <p>Note. Some of the rise in numbers of those who identify as CHamoru in US areas other than Guåhan and NMI
                might be due to improved census race/ethnicity categories and increased self-identification as CHamoru since
                2000. “Other US” does not include the territories of Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, or American Samoa as
                contacted US Census agents were not able to verify whether any CHamoru resided in those areas. Percentages

                briefs/c2010br-12.pdf ).</p>

                <p>While there have long been fluctuations in Guåhan's population, major shifts have
                taken place within the lifetimes of our elders that have radically reshaped and re-
                structured many aspects of Guåhan's socio-cultural and political landscape (Bettis,
                1996, p. 112; Untalan, n.d.). Guåhan, a homeland in which CHamorus made up the
                vast majority of the island's population up to pre-WWII years (91% in 1940), is now
                one where CHamorus are outnumbered due to sizeable influxes of new community
                members, including those from the NMI (Table 1). Many facets of modern life in
                Guåhan would be unrecognizable to those alive just a few generations ago.</p>

                <p>Note. Percentages are rounded off. Different censuses may use varying standards and methodology. The 1970
                Census was omitted as it only identified the population as “native” or “foreign born,” which did not allow for an
                accurate counting of CHamorus versus other ethnic populations on island. Adapted from The Native Hawaiian
                and Other Pacific Islander Population: 2010, by L. Hixson et al., 2012, 2010 Census Briefs (https://www.census.gov/

                Guam, 2020.</p>

                <p>During our great-grandparents' time, very few in the community did not identify
                as CHamoru—speaking the language fluently as their first language, practicing
                the CHamoru culture, and living a CHamoru pre-WWII lifestyle. However, early
                influxes caused the status of the CHamoru population to plummet to that of being
                a plurality by 1950, just a few years after WWII, a status that has remained true up
                to 2010 (Figure 6 and Table 1) (Bettis, 1996, pp. 106-107). Many are waiting to see if the
                2020 census tabulations will challenge this long-standing status. It has now long
                been the combined non-CHamoru peoples that make up the majority of the island's
                population. Currently, the second largest group on island (26%) are those who have
                emigrated from the Philippine Islands, mainly in the decades following WWII, a
                marked change from comprising just 2.6% of Guahån's 1940 population (Quan, n.d.).</p>

                <p>Note. The delegation was about 500 people strong. Recognizing the island's history of colonialism, immigration,
                and emigration, Guåhan decided that, in addition to Indigenous Pacific Islander CHamoru delegates, other
                community members who practiced or performed CHamoru arts and culture would also qualify to serve as
                delegates, regardless of their ethnicity or whether they resided off-island or not. From Monica Okada Guzman,

                <p>Some scholars, such as the Honorable (former Congressman) Dr. Robert A.
                Underwood (1997) have stated that such trends of dramatic population growth and
                change may not bode well for the survival of the CHamoru people. He further said,
                “It may simply not be healthy for a society to change with such rapidity regardless
                of the characteristics of the incoming migrants or the ostensible economic benefits
                they bring” (p. 131).</p>

                <p>CHamorus as a people are often described by others as “welcoming” and “hospita-
                ble” toward newcomers and visitors (DCA, 2003, p. 63). And while we can point to
                many ways in which other peoples and their cultural ways have added to the variety
                of life and experiences in Guåhan over the centuries, and continue to contribute
                to the island society and economy, we must also remember that non-CHamorus
                create other types of impacts as well. Adding to the challenges of globalization,
                modernization, and other forces, the rapid influx of others is straining Guåhan's
                natural and governmental resources as well as, to some degree, repressing the
                practice and maintenance of i kostumbren CHamoru (the Chamorro culture)
                (Underwood, 1997, p. 131).</p>

                <p>Inagofli'e': CHamoru Caring for Each Other
                Much in keeping with Pacific Island cultural ways, CHamorus will often open their
                houses, arms, and families in looking after new community members and visitors.
                This is often referred to as being “hospitable” or “generous,” but it really is so much
                more than that. One will typically not be thirsty or go hungry if there is a CHamoru
                nearby with drink or food in hand. At an event, a CHamoru host and their relatives
                will periodically check in on guests, hand out more refreshments, offer to dispose
                of guests' used plates, and offer food to take home (Mendiola, n.d.a). The goal is for
                the guest to be “comfortable and wanting for nothing” (DCA, 2003, p. 63). Not often
                discussed, however, is that the rules of host-guest etiquette extend in both direc-
                tions and involve a custom of reciprocity, a key CHamoru cultural value alongside
                interdependence, and a sense of obligation (Souder, 1994, p. 194). Those brought up
                within similar cultures know these rules inherently. Many others have learned these
                unwritten rules along the way or are continuing to learn.</p>

                <p>However, there are a growing number of community members coming from other
                US areas and other countries who do not know about certain customs prevalent in
                i kustombren CHamoru, including rules about not being able to easily say “no” in
                Island cultures so one has to develop a sense of not asking for more than is appro-
                priate to receive; rules about deferring the first and second offers of a gift or offer of
                food, as a means of gauging whether accepting that which is being offered would
                unnecessarily burden the host; rules that relationships are, at their best, reciprocal
                and generational; and other such Islander codes of conduct (Hezel, 2001; Hezel, 2013;
                Mendiola, n.d.a). While CHamoru younger generations continue such protocols to
                a degree, at least some of the CHamoru manåmko' (elders) and others express the
                view that they see some of the finer details or intentions of customary protocol as
                they knew it to be eroding, such as when it is proper to balutan (term informally
                used to describe packing up food to carry out after an event) and who should be pri-
                oritized in benefiting from balutan (e.g., Paulino et al., 2010). Mindful of this, cultural
                leaders are working to ensure transmission of these finer elements.</p>

                <p>CHamoru Culture and Our Multi-Faceted Island Community
                A variety of cultural features from elsewhere have been, in whole or in part, woven
                into the tapestry of island life, many of which have been CHamorucized. For in-
                stance, a look at our island fiesta tables shows a sampling of the many peoples and</p>

                <p>cultures that have come to the island (see Figure 3) (Mendiola, n.d.b). Added to
                traditional CHamoru fare like fish, taro, breadfruit, and katupat (rice cooked in a
                small basket of woven coconut leaves), have been CHamorucized dishes like titiyas,
                tamåles, and red rice, as well as the introduction of pancit, lumpia, Kentucky Fried
                Chicken, sushi, kimchi, and much more.</p>

                <p>New names and new family members have made their way into CHamoru clans
                (Forbes, n.d.). The CHamoru language has, as living languages do, adopted
                and adapted from other languages that were imposed or otherwise introduced
                (Underwood, n.d., p. 10). Holidays from elsewhere have replaced or been added to
                traditional ones that are still celebrated or are in the process of being reinstituted
                (such as ancestral processions of commemoration). And a broad range of new events
                and activities have been added to the continuation of core values, such as respecting
                elders, and the maintenance, perpetuation, or revitalization of traditional practices
                and lifeways (Figure 7) (Souder, 1992; Underwood, n.d.).</p>

                many dance groups that now exist in Guåhan. They showcase the success of the last several decades of effort that
                revitalized CHamoru dance, chant, and other traditions after centuries of suppression of aspects of CHamoru
                culture by colonial and other agents. The multi-storied hotels and developed residential neighborhoods in the
                background convey the continuation of the CHamoru people and lifeways in modern times. From Edward B.

                <p>These cultural exchanges go both ways. For newcomers and visitors, it may be their
                first chance to try local and localized foods such as kelaguen månnok (chicken mixed
                with lemon, onion, and pepper); fina'denne' (local hot sauce); empanadas; and
                pickled papaya, daigo (radish), mangoes, eggs, and even pickles (Figure 8). Living
                in Guåhan may be their first foray out of the US mainland or their first venture
                from another country or a neighboring island to become, essentially, immigrants or
                settlers to an Indigenous homeland, (e.g., Bettis, 1996; Underwood, 1997).</p>

                <p>For some, island life evokes a slower-paced style of living in comparison to the city
                they left behind, while for others, Guåhan is the big city compared to the smaller
                island or other community they moved from. What has become Guåhan's multi-eth-
                nic, multi-cultural community may be familiar to some newcomers in its being a very
                cosmopolitan mix of people, while for others it may be a new experience in diversity
                and their first time to live as part of a minority, which may take some getting used to.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, numerous non-CHamoru members of Guåhan's community have
                called the island their home for decades. Quite a few have raised children in Guåhan
                and perhaps even have grandchildren or great-grandchildren here, or, having been
                born in Guåhan or having arrived as a child, know no other “home.” Some of these</p>

                <p>long-time community members now refer to themselves as Guamanian (a term with
                a complex history, as for decades, i Taotao Guåhan were referred to as such), or are
                at times referred to as Che'lu (sibling), Chamaoli (Chamorro + haoli, an adopted
                Hawaiian term for outsider, or foreigner), or other such terms meant to show their
                long-term connection with the community (G.E. Taitano, n.d.a; Borja, 2017).</p>

                <p>Long-term residents, though perhaps identifying as an American, Australian, Filipino,
                Japanese, Thai, Pohnpeian, German, or another ethnicity on the one hand, may also
                identify, on the other hand, as someone who grew up in a Pacific Island community,
                or in Guåhan specifically, thus perhaps considering themselves a bit different than
                their fellow ethnic or national “kin.” Many long-time community members marry
                into the CHamoru culture or marry another long-term resident, at times creating
                identifiable groups within the larger community. Though our community handles all
                these changes—and new levels of diversity that have happened rapidly—relatively
                well, there are tensions and serious issues such as a certain amount of division based
                on ethnic lines as well as various challenges to the Indigenous CHamoru culture and
                to Guåhan's quest for decolonization (Bettis, 1996, p. 111).</p>

                <p>Socio-cultural and Political Impacts
                CHamorus, both in the Marianas and abroad, as any other people, have a wide
                range of ways of looking at issues such as Guåhan's social, cultural and political con-
                ditions—each of which is a complex mix of inside and outside forces at work. Some
                of the overarching concerns held by portions of the community over the years are
                related to issues of dilution, domination, and diversion, each of which are discussed
                briefly below (Table 2).</p>

                <p>Dilution
                There are several ways in which the concept of dilution impacts i Taotao Guåhan
                both locally and within the nation. Impacts caused by those who have migrated to
                the island since 1898 and 1940 are why the United Nations adopted particular resolu-
                tions and plans of action for non-self-governing areas, such as “instructing member
                states to prevent migration to colonial territories” precisely because it is understood
                that their presence is in general “disruptive” and can be a “major obstacle” when
                it comes to exercising the right to self-determination in a genuine way for the peo-
                ples of that area to whom the right of self-determination belongs (J. Aguon, 2012;
                Bettis, 1996, p. 112).</p>

                <p>However, the United States has allowed migration to its territories to be largely
                unregulated (outside of national immigration laws and regulations) and the large
                influx of non-CHamorus who have become the majority of Guåhan's community
                have indeed muddied the understanding of many socio-cultural and political issues.
                Guam's history illustrates how “colonial powers have often used immigration to dis-
                tract, confuse, and subvert the issues of decolonization, especially when they wish</p>

                <p>to remain in control of the territory” with immigrants as “part of the colonizing
                process” (Bettis, 1996, p. 111). Many i Taotao Guåhan have worried over the decades
                about the dilution of their political control over their homeland, control that was
                hard fought for and has only briefly been regained (1950-present) in a limited fash-
                ion after over 300 years of colonial rule (Bettis, 1996, p. 111).</p>

                <p>At the national level, the peoples of Guåhan are only allowed a diluted form of par-
                ticipation in Congress (with a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives
                and no presence in the Senate) and are not allowed to participate in the vote for
                president. Instead, Congress has plenary (absolute) authority over US territories like
                Guåhan, and has thus far provided only a limited set of rights and privileges to their
                residents (Bevacqua, n.d.; C.P. Taitano, 1996).</p>

                <p>CHamoru standing within the United States is further diluted as in many ways
                they are treated as a minority, not only abroad, but in their own homeland. This
                is largely due to the way that the US federal government and prevailing ideology
                frame race, indigeneity, recognition of Indigenous lands, and notions of equality
                (e.g., K.B. Aguon, 1993; Perez, 2002; Perez, 2003). Despite decades of local efforts
                to have a real voice within a US government proclaimed to be based on the
                democratic principles of equality and representation, CHamorus, among other
                Indigenous Peoples in the United States, have been provided little consideration
                and recognition (Waldman, 1985).</p>

                <p>CHamorus, along with other Pacific Islanders, have been and continue to be, in
                some ways, considered “non-White” in the United States. Parents, grandparents,
                and great-grandparents within many CHamoru families served in the US military in
                “Colored” troops, or were relegated to the same or similar limitations as “Coloreds”
                by being able to serve only as mess attendants or personal aides to officers; were
                denied service at establishments that did not serve “Coloreds” during the Jim Crow
                years in the continental United States; and, at home in Guåhan, have had to contend
                with, during much of the island's history under the United States, segregated spaces
                and facilities that have been, at their core, separate and unequal (e.g., Quitugua, 1991,
                pp. 75–76; Sanchez, 1989, p. 145; Vance and Manning, 2015, p. 135).</p>

                <p>Domination
                Furthermore, the large influx of non-CHamorus who have arrived in the last 70 or
                so years, came with or developed their own views about what is or what should be
                CHamoru, Indigenous, or Islander ways, which may run alongside, dominate, or
                overlap with the range of CHamoru views about these same issues. Some of these
                newcomers are supportive of the maintenance of the CHamoru culture , while
                others may still be trying to figure out what constitutes island life and I kustom-
                bren i Taotao Guåhan (the culture of the CHamorus of Guam). Still others may
                have their own notions of what being productive should look like (e.g., whether
                Islanders use their time “productively” or not); which cultural “measuring stick”
                should be used in assessing i Taotao Guåhan and their culture and language (e.g.,
                whether they are truly CHamoru and to what degree); or what aspects of life
                should be prioritized and when (e.g., the time and place for family and familial
                obligations which are primary considerations in i kostumbren CHamoru), and so
                forth (Aguon, 1993). Added to the presence of these notions is that some of the
                island's community members may be quite vocal about their precepts and domi-
                nate the community conversation about where their notions should figure into the
                consideration of local matters (Bettis, 1996, p. 106).</p>

                <p>A lot of energy can thus be spent sorting through island issues to make sense of
                them, or negating the disruption these competing notions cause. Some of this energy
                is spent reminding the community at large and each other, that the CHamorus as a
                people have the right to, and that there is value in, recognizing and maintaining
                their own Indigenous set of core values, philosophies, and lifeways (Aguon, 1993;
                Bevacqua, n.d.; Borja, 2017; Underwood, 1991, Underwood, n.d.).</p>

                <p>An example of muddied issues and competing notions is the political issue of deter-
                mining who will partake in Guåhan's act of self-determination. The United States
                placed the island on the UN list of non-self-governing territories in 1946 just after
                WWII, thereby creating international recognition that the people of the island have
                the right to decolonize (see Benavente, n.d.; The Organic Act of Guam, n.d.; The
                Treaty of Paris of 1898, Article IX; United Nations, n.d.). The Government of Guåhan's
                position has long been that the “Native Inhabitants” of the island, a category of
                people referred to and defined by the United States in pertinent legal documents,
                are those who will vote in a decolonization plebiscite (Native Inhabitants are defined</p>

                <p>as those that were present during germane historical events of 1950 or 1898, and their
                descendants) (V.-L. Leon Guerero, 2014). Others have stated that the right belongs to
                the CHamoru people, while still others feel that every US citizen who is a resident
                should participate in the vote. For many, the latter position is extremely controversial
                given the rapid demographic changes since 1940 which have created the potential
                for non-Native Inhabitants and non-CHamorus to drown out Native Inhabitant and
                CHamoru political will regarding the future status of a CHamoru homeland.</p>

                <p>In 2011, a non-Native Inhabitant, non-CHamoru resident filed a suit in court to
                defend his claimed right to vote in the people of Guåhan's decolonization process.
                Although self-determination is an international right, the ruling of the case was
                decided following US domestic law with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
                against the Government of Guåhan, striking down the island's decolonization law as
                unconstitutional. The case came to a close when, in 2020, the Supreme Court denied
                to review the case. This meant that the 9th Circuit 2019 ruling currently stands. For
                many, the issues are still far from settled.</p>

                <p>Diversion
                While recognizing that CHamorus, like all groups of people, embrace a wide range
                of traditional values and practices, it is also true that, to varying degrees and in vary-
                ing ways, customary CHamoru values, philosophies, and lifeways are impacted by
                the presence of the large number of non-CHamorus in Guåhan (and by having large
                numbers of CHamorus living outside the Marianas archipelago). These short- and
                long-term community members from other cultures, or even from neighboring
                Mariana Islands to the north, arrive in Guåhan with their own cultural, personal, or
                other sets of social, political, and cultural interests that may or may not align with
                those who are i Taotao Guåhan.</p>

                <p>Within this matrix of CHamorus and diverse community members, are a wide variety
                of positions depending on a host of factors like cultural identity, family or political
                party affiliation, level or type of education, and personal convictions, among others,
                as they weigh in on issues like what types of directions the island economy should
                go in, what decolonized political status is the best option for us, and more. The end
                result, thus, is often a mixture of Indigenous and non-Indigenous community mem-
                bers alongside each other in a diversity of social, political, and economic positions.</p>

                <p>Part of what has become perhaps more evident in recent years is the dilemma that,
                even if long-time residents and newcomers respect the local culture and issues of
                Guåhan, they may feel like they do not have a real stake in, or want to interfere in, par-
                ticular issues such as militarization, especially regarding Indigenous i Taotao Guåhan
                claims to land. These dilemmas can have real consequences in and of themselves.</p>

                <p>Take, for example, the public review and comment periods that are a part of the en-
                vironmental impact statements prepared for militarization processes that have been
                ongoing for the last decade. If community members do not participate or comment
                because they do not feel they have a right to weigh in on i Taotao Guåhan issues
                or issues they may not be present for in the future, their non-involvement may be
                read as consent for the proposed actions. Or, conversely, if they do weigh in, such
                thoughts may impact the outcome based on their different non-Indigenous connec-
                tions to and ways of conceiving of the land, which can be distinct from that of the
                CHamoru worldview, which holds that, “Land is the soul of Chamorro culture. It,
                together with the sea, gives life to the Chamorro.” (For further detail regarding these
                CHamoru concepts see, Cabrera, et al., 2015; Phillips, n.d.)</p>

                <p>Examples of Socio-Cultural and Political Impacts on Daily Life
                Many facets of life in Guåhan have been impacted by the history and circumstances
                of colonial systems, modernization, and island demographics, each deserving to be
                examined in detail to provide nuanced understandings. Here, however, I will briefly
                introduce just a few important issues that are part of our daily lives, those revolving
                around where we live and around work life and school life, which perhaps feel so
                familiar and basic to modern-day living that we may not typically view them as im-
                pacting the CHamoru culture and family structure.</p>

                <p>Where We Live
                In the big picture, it is readily apparent that the core CHamoru value of the primacy
                of family still has a strong presence, though it has changed in certain ways (Iyechad,
                2001; Marsh, 2019; Souder, 1992, p. 144; Underwood, n.d., p. 14). For example, owing
                to the influence of the concept of an American nuclear family and other influences,
                “extended” families are less likely to live in family compounds nowadays. It is now
                more common for family members to live not only farther apart but in different
                villages, islands, states, or even countries (Souder, 1992, p. 144). These more recent</p>

                <p>residential patterns are impacting to some degree the time, energy, and types of re-
                sources contributed toward fulfilling family obligations that bond and reinforce the
                CHamoru family. Advances in technology along with the growth of social media,
                and their increased use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, are adding their
                own dynamics to these issues allowing for more types of connectivity between
                family and friends on-island and off-island.</p>

                <p>Work Life
                For centuries, a good number of CHamorus resisted fully participating in the cash
                economy in many ways during the Spanish and early US colonial administrations,
                though there had been a number of extremely successful CHamoru families during
                both administrations (A. Leon Guerero, n.d.; Sanchez, 1989, pp. 272–281). The cash
                economy gained a stronger foothold during the US administration after WWII
                when the CHamoru people and other locals dealt with issues such as bombed and
                burned-out lands, dislocation owing to a high number of US military land takings
                (including whole villages), and relocation within the island (A. Leon Guerero, n.d.;
                Sanchez, 1989, pp. 277–281).</p>

                <p>While numerous i Taotao Guåhan have succeeded and earned recognition for
                excelling in the workplace (such as within the US military), modern work life has
                impacted traditional timelines and motivations for and methods of conducting
                “work” in particular ways. For instance, familial and other celebrations nowadays
                may have to consider whether they will occur during times outside of working hours
                or whether it is now perhaps more convenient or otherwise beneficial to meet family
                obligations by contributing cash rather than labor or something personally fished
                or hunted, gathered, or harvested (Iyechad, 2001, pp. 172-174).</p>

                <p>School Life
                While perhaps no one in Guåhan challenges the value of formal education per se,
                modern schools operate as cultural entities unto themselves, complete with their
                own rules of conduct, processes, and standards (Aguon, 1993). Over the centuries,
                i Taotao Guåhan have seen education shift from traditional informal practices of
                mentoring and guiding family youth to formal systems instructing youth in which
                teachers may spend more time with children than the children's family.</p>

                <p>Island students today receive lessons in classrooms from a mixture of i Taotao
                Guåhan, Taotao Sa'ipan, or other CHamorus; long-term residents; newcomers; or
                transient instructors who utilize textbooks written, more often than not, for a con-
                tinental US setting that does not always translate well to local conditions (though
                there are ongoing efforts to more actively develop local curricula). For example,
                students may never learn about CHamoru authors such as Peter Onedera, despite
                Señot Onedera being formally recognized as Sainan Minenhalom Sinangan Ginen
                i Hila' (Master Storyteller), but the students will perhaps instead be taught about
                Shakespeare. They will be taught about “spring,” “summer,” “fall,” and “winter”
                rather than fañomnåkan and fanuchånan (the “sunny” and “rainy” seasons of the
                Mariana Islands). Foreign socio-political and cultural ways of thinking can be em-
                bedded in such situations and can challenge Pacific Island cultures and settings if
                we do not all work to recognize and mitigate them (Aguon, 1993).</p>

                <p>Sa Håfa? What Does It All Mean?
                There are many ways we could explore these issues further. Each of the facets of
                life discussed above have certain costs and benefits: salaries provide the ability to
                support families and fulfill familial obligations, perhaps even in an enhanced fash-
                ion; work provides services and goods to Guåhan's community members; education
                and training programs open doors to jobs and careers that are personally satisfying,
                benefit the community, and provide salaries that, as noted above, allow us to fulfill
                familial obligations; and so on. While no one is necessarily calling for the end to new
                residents arriving on Guåhan's shores, to formal education, or for the end of a cash
                economy in Guåhan, it is important to be conscious of the ways that these forces and
                the diversity of our community impact cultural philosophies, traditions and lifeways
                that are foundational to i Taotao Guåhan culture and the island way of life. Further,
                it is important to be aware that the historical circumstances, colonization, and rapid
                shifts in demographics have had even wider impacts than those discussed here.</p>

                <p>It is no coincidence that communities that suffer historical trauma, rapid changes,
                and other events as happened in Låguas yan Gåni end up with wounds and scars
                that take concerted effort to address and heal. The story is all too common among
                Indigenous communities, wherein a toll is exacted upon the physical and mental
                health of Indigenous Peoples as individuals, as families, and as communities. I
                Taotao Guåhan and other CHamorus now suffer the highest rates of diabetes,</p>

                <p>obesity, hypertension, and cancer, in addition to the highest rates of adult and ju-
                venile crime within Guåhan's diverse ethnic communities (Rapadas et al., 2005). As
                i Taotao Guåhan work to heal and move forward, many express an appreciation of
                those who recognize the validity of their culture that deserves to be assessed accord-
                ing to its own “measuring stick,” and of those who do not treat their culture as a
                failed attempt according to someone else's standards (Figure 9).</p>

                <p>Note. Revitalization of CHamoru dance has been so successful that guma' (houses) are now being established
                outside of the Mariana Islands—in other US areas like California and Washington, but also in other countries
                like Japan. Above are members of the Japan-based Guma' Famagu'on Tåno' Yan I Tasi (House of the Children
                of the Land and the Sea) who performed at Gef Pago February 2017. Also present are a few CHamoru and
                other Guåhan community members. From Edward B. San Nicolas, personal communication, 2017, February 17.

                to Pacific literature, led by writers such as Craig Santos Perez and Cecilia

                <p>⁶Craig Santos Perez's works are especially noteworthy. See, in particular, his three
                collections of poetry: 1 from unincorporated territory [hacha] (2008), 2 from unincor-
                porated territory [saina] (2010), and 3 from unincorporated territory [guma'] (2014)–for
                which he was honored with the prestigious American Book Award in 2015. He was
                also recognized with the 2011 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Poetry and, most
                recently, the 2016 Lannen Literary Fellowship.</p>

                <p>⁸My reference to ube as symbolic of Filipino cultural “roots” is because ube is
                made from the root of the purple yam. This metaphor is in accordance with my</p>

                of Humanities Diliman.</p>

                <p>⁹In Identity Formation, Agency, and Culture: A Social Psychological Synthesis, James E.
                Côté and Charles G. Levine (2002) describe the numerous difficulties faced by the
                descendants of immigrants.</p>

                <p>¹⁰The songs in my album were written by my mother, Alpha Espina. Helen Chaco
                provided the CHamoru translation in the lyrics.</p>

                <p>¹¹The use of personal experience as an introspective, self-reflexive process is
                not uncommon in research involving identity and its negotiation, particularly
                within diasporic communities. See Nadal (2010), David (2013), Rath (2000), Hall
                (1989), and Skinner (2009).</p>

                <p>¹²Portes and Rumbaut (2001) found that a thoroughly acculturated third generation
                lacks the drive and social resources of their immigrant ancestors, and thus their per-
                spectives on American imperialism are largely conditioned by what happened to
                their parents and grandparents.</p>

                <p>¹³See Constantino (1970).</p>

                <p>¹⁴I composed the lyrics, while my mother composed the music.</p>

                <p>¹⁵Capitalization is reproduced exactly as it appears in the original.</p>

                <p>¹⁶Internalized oppression is defined by David (2013) as a condition in which an op-
                pressed individual or group come to believe that they are inferior to those of the
                dominant group; it is possibly the most insidious consequence of oppression.</p>

                <p>¹⁷According to David (2013), colonial mentality can be perpetuated though the
                generations, and these attitudes become more pronounced and exacerbated
                through the generations.</p>

                the census for the Consulate.</p>

                <p>¹⁹“The CW-1 nonimmigrant visa program permits employers who meet program
                requirements to hire nonimmigrant workers temporarily in the Commonwealth
                of the Northern Mariana Island (CNMI or ‘Commonwealth') to perform services
                or labor based on the employer's need. Job opportunities for the CW-1 program
                can have validity periods of up to one year and may be renewed for two addition-
                al periods of up to one year, with the exception of statutorily defined ‘long-term
                workers' who may receive a certification with a validity period of up to three years,
                which may be renewed for additional periods of up to three years” (United States
                Department of Labor, n.d.).</p>

                <p>²⁰In modern orthography in Guam, the spelling would be “Tåno' i CHamoru.”</p>

                <p>²³In seeing how these arguments can work in the CHamoru case, it is important to
                note the differences between CHamorus and “domestic dependent nations.”</p>

                <p>²⁶The most frequent languages spoken in Saipan at home (population 5 years and
                over: 43,871 = 100%) are the Philippine languages with 33%, Chamorro with 22% and
                English only with 17% (CNMI Department of Commerce 2010, p. 181; p. 186). The rest
                of the languages are spoken less frequently than 10% and are not listed here.</p>

                <p>²⁷English as a lingua franca is described as “a ‘contact language' between persons
                who share neither a common Native tongue nor a common (national) culture, and for
                whom English is the chosen foreign language of communication” (Firth, 1996, p. 240).</p>

                <p>²⁸Speakers adjust their accent or other aspects of language production according to
                listener's speaker style or a desired variety.</p>

                <p>²⁹The Peace Corps, however, also were the people who brought about a change in
                language attitude towards the Indigenous languages: The value of the local languag-
                es was re-discovered and appreciated (Topping, 1985, p. 119).</p>

                its possible vanishing, see (Ellis, 2016).</p>

                <p>³¹The Carolinians in Saipan call themselves Refaluwasch, the “people of our land,”
                which refers to Saipan (cf. Kuehling, 2012, p. 57).</p>

                violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act
                (Martinez, 2015). However, the Navy continues to use the same methods within
                the Mariana Islands Training and Testing (MITT) program. See: https://www.

                <p>³⁵In April 2017, the DOD scheduled additional meetings before the revision EIS
                has been released. In addition, they were scheduled with very short notice and
                took place from 2–4 pm during the workday (Villahermosa, 2017). For more,
                see Rep. Demapan's concerns: http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/

                <p>³⁶Adams also says that the CNMI is “one of the poorest, most isolated and least
                well-represented entities in the US.” Brian Turner, an attorney at the National Trust
                for Historic Preservation, says the EIS proposal demonstrates “environmental in-
                justice” and “if this sort of thing were proposed in North Carolina [the continental
                United States], it just would never happen” (Hofschneider, 2016a).</p>

                <p>³⁷In addition to the LFTRC on Tinian, another example of the US Military environ-
                mental contamination legacy are the 42 leaking oil fuel tanks abandoned by the US
                Navy in the 1960s in Saipan, known as the “Tanapag Fuel Farm.” This is in addition
                to the millions of pounds of Unexploded Ordnance (UXOs) (Hofschneider, 2016a).</p>

                <p>³⁸It would also (ironically) destroy the first peace monument built by US Navy
                Seabees in 1945 in Tinian after the Japanese Imperial Forces surrendered. In addi-
                tion, the training would potentially destroy 200 sites that are eligible for the National
                Register for Historic Places (Hofschneider, 2016c).</p>

                However, the groups maintain their right to sue (Torre, 2017).</p>

                <p>⁴⁶Farallon de Medenilla, or FDM as it is commonly referenced, was a name given
                to the island under Spanish colonial rule, but the Indigenous Chamorro name for
                the island is No'os (personal communication with historian Genevieve S. Cabrera).</p>

                <p>⁴⁷Specifically, Section 802 of the CNMI Covenant reads: “(a) The following property
                will be made available to the Government of the United States by lease to enable it
                to carry out its defense responsibilities: (1) on Tinian Island, approximately 17,799
                acres (7,203 hectares) and the waters immediately adjacent thereto; (2) on Saipan
                Island, approximately 177 acres (72 hectares) at Tanapag Harbor; and (3) on Farallon
                de Medinilla Island, approximately 206 acres (83 hectares) encompassing the entire
                island, and the waters immediately adjacent thereto (b) The United States affirms
                that it has no present need for or present intention to acquire any greater interest in
                property listed above than that which is granted to it under Subsection 803(a), or to
                acquire any property in addition to that listed in Subsection (a), above, in order to
                carry out its defense responsibilities” (CNMI Covenant, n.d.).</p>

                <p>⁴⁸This terminology was employed in a number of personal communications on
                Saipan during conversations that took place beginning in 2006 onward when com-
                munity members were describing the military's presence in the Marianas after WWII.</p>

                <p>⁴⁹The Marianas Political Status Commission in 1975, defined the “Covenant” as a
                “binding agreement like a contract or compact and the title used for this agreement
                is not intended to have independent legal significance. This title seems appropriate
                because the relationship between the United States and the Northern Marianas
                will be a permanent one, which in its fundamental respects will not be able to be
                changed by one party without the consent of the other” (To Approve, 1975).</p>

                <p>⁵⁰It should be noted that, according to Smith (1991), “The Marianas plebiscite on
                future status held in 1975, notwithstanding the size of the vote for a Commonwealth
                (78.8% with a turnout of over 90%) failed to include independence or free association
                options. The options required by UN decolonization principles were not offered and
                the status of this act of ‘self-determination' was criticized by a number of legal schol-
                ars. The failure to present other options reflects an agreement by both the United
                States and political leaders in the Northern Marianas to push the matter through as
                quickly as possible, and implied some lack of confidence in the islander's support
                for Commonwealth status” (p. 36). Historically, it is understood that the members
                of the Congress of Micronesia (a bicameral legislature created in 1965 during the
                TTPI) were not in agreement with the members of the Marianas delegation in the
                1960's about the Northern Marianas desiring a closer political union with the United
                States. (McPhetres, 1997).</p>

                <p>⁵¹The importance of the Insular Cases also highlights the court's reliance on Rice vs.
                Cayetano as a tool for understanding indigeneity in the Marianas. While the forma-
                tion of a Northern Marianas Descent identity was not intended to map onto race,
                it has sometimes been conflated with race and is viewed as a direct violation of the
                U.S. fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. However, the use of Rice vs. Cayetano to
                understand race relations in the CNMI is problematic and has been problematized
                by a number of legal scholars (Aguon, 2009; Torres, 2012; Villazor, 2018).</p>

                <p>⁵²While I am not suggesting that the CNMI is legally defined as a territory, it has
                often been presented as undistinguishable from other territories in terms of federal</p>

                <p>policies. Horey (2003) has argued that politically, this has been an outcome of the
                “overall federal tendency … to ignore the unique circumstances of the CNMI, and
                lump it together with the traditional U.S. territories.” (p. 182) In theory, this distinc-
                tion is important, since commonwealth status affords the Northern Mariana Islands
                with a level of autonomy that other territories do not have, such as the right to
                self-government and the creation of the CNMI Covenant and Constitution.</p>

                <p>⁵³Fallon (1991) argues that the term “‘commonwealth' has no precise definition for
                the U.S. Government” (p. 26) and points to the historically arbitrary use of the term
                by other U.S. states such as Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and
                Virginia; as well as the Philippines' short-term use of the term between 1935–1946. For
                further discussion of the “graded, political limbo” that “the federal government has
                consigned” to it's eight insular territories, including American Samoa, the Federated
                States of Micronesia, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas, Palau,
                Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, see Joseph E. Fallon's (1991) “Federal Policy
                and U.S. Territories: The Political Restructuring of the United States of America.” A
                similar assessment of national belonging is addressed by Barreto and Lazaro who
                write that there are “varying degrees of national belonging.”</p>

                <p>⁵⁴At the time of this writing, Guam was listed under Chapter XI of the Charter of the
                United Nation's list of Non-Self-Governing Territories (NSGT) which are defined by
                the United Nations as “territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure
                of self-government.”</p>

                <p>⁵⁵This bill was submitted around the same time that major increases in military
                planning were being discussed. For example, it was submitted shortly before
                the Final Record of Decision (ROD) for the Marine Relocation and the Final
                Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Mariana Islands Training and
                Testing (MITT) was released.</p>

                <p>⁵⁶The first political status commission refers to the original Covenant agreement
                made in 1975 between the CNMI and the United States of America.</p>

                <p>⁵⁷The three issues being referred to are: 1) The CNMI's legal struggle to retain
                control over the submerged lands surrounding the Marianas 2) the increasing
                militarization of the islands and surrounding sea and airspace, and 3) the U.S.'s deci-
                sion to federalize the CNMI immigration system which up until 2008, had been run
                by the CNMI Government.</p>

                <p>⁵⁸Chamorro scholar Keith Camacho (2011) conducted an analysis of Chamorro and
                Filipino social movements in the Marianas and argues that the ensuing federaliza-
                tion of the CNMI immigration system due to labor violations can be understood as
                a move to further militarize the region through the logic of border policing. This ar-
                gument is instructive of the way in which all three issues fall under the umbrella of
                militarism. It is also worthwhile to note that the precarious economic situation in the
                CNMI that was left in the wake of federal immigration, has produced a further reli-
                ance on militarization as a means for economic revenue. For example, in the CNMI's
                Comprehensive Economic Development Plan 2009–2014, the document notes that,
                “Although faced with many economic challenges the Commonwealth looks to an
                opportunity which is already bringing in new investment to the region. The planned
                military buildup, which is the planned move of Marines from Okinawa to Guam,
                will undoubtedly bring both positive and negative challenges” (Commonwealth
                Economic Development Strategic Planning Commission, 2009).</p>

                <p>⁵⁹This public presentation was entitled “U.S. Constitutional Rights in the Territories
                and the CNMI,” and was held at American Memorial Park on July 8, 2018. It was
                hosted by the Honorable Gustavo A. Gelpi from Puerto Rico and the Honorable Jose
                S. Dela Cruz from Saipan (CNMI).</p>

                <p>⁶⁰The largest of these incidents is now described as the “Jack Abramoff CNMI
                scandal,” which involved U.S. lobbyists and other government officials swaying
                Congressional actions in the CNMI.</p>

                <p>⁶²To be clear, I am not arguing that voting rights are not important, but instead
                that fighting for equality based on an assimilationist discourse propounded by
                United States policies does not go “far enough” in alleviating the deeply asym-
                metrical socio-political and economic structural relations that characterize the
                US-CNMI relationship. This argument aligns itself with Indigenous scholarship in
                North America that recognizes both the possibilities and limitations of describing
                Indigenous struggles within the framework of “human and civil rights based social
                justice projects” (Tuck and Yang, 2012, p. 1).</p>

                <p>⁶³The eight insular territories include American Samoa, the Federated States of
                Micronesia (FSM), Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas, Palau,
                Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The political status of the islands are as
                follows: FSM (Free Association), Marshall Islands (Free Association), Palau (Free
                Association), Northern Marianas (Commonwealth, unincorporated), Puerto Rico
                (Commonwealth, unincorporated), Guam (unincorporated), U.S. Virgin Islands
                (unincorporated), American Samoa (unincorporated).</p>

                <p>⁶⁴Both the CNMI and Guam are considered “organized and unincorporated” (Fallon,
                1991, p. 25) despite their different political statuses.</p>

                <p>⁶⁵For an in-depth discussion of Article XII and its usage in the local court system in
                the CNMI and Guam, see “Problematizing the Protection of Culture and the Insular
                Cases” by Rose Cuison Villazor (2018) and “Reading Between the (Blood) Lines” by
                Rose Cuison Villazor (2010). While the legal ramifications of these tensions have
                continued to play out at the time of this writing, the question of whether US laws
                can accommodate for Indigenous rights in the CNMI is outside the scope of this
                writing. However, I draw attention to Article XII to highlight the longer and more
                enduring role of US political power and its ability to transform the politics of
                indigeneity in the CNMI.</p>
